The C-2A ""Greyhound"" transport aircraft was traveling to the USS Ronald Reagan when it crashed. Eight people were rescued quickly and are in good condition, but Japanese and U.S. ships and aircraft had continued searching for the others.

The Navy's 7th Fleet said details of the three missing sailors were being withheld pending completion of notification of next of kin procedures.

The Navy is investigating the crash.

The twin-propeller plane crashed about 500 nautical miles (925 kilometers) southeast of Okinawa while bringing passengers and cargo from Japan to the aircraft carrier.

The Reagan was participating in a joint exercise with Japan's navy when the plane crashed. The carrier was leading the search and rescue efforts along with Japan's naval forces.

The Navy describes the Nov. 16-26 joint exercise in waters off Okinawa as the ""premier training event"" between the U.S. and Japanese navies, designed to increase defensive readiness and interoperability in air and sea operations.

The Japan-based 7th Fleet has had two fatal naval accidents in Asian waters this year, leaving 17 sailors dead and prompting the removal of eight top Navy officers from their posts, including the 7th Fleet commander.

The USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker collided near Singapore in August, leaving 10 U.S. sailors dead. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided off Japan. The Navy has concluded the collisions were avoidable and recommended changes including improved training and increasing sleep and stress management for sailors.

The Fitzgerald left its home port in Yokosuka, Japan, on Friday to begin its journey to Pascagoula, Mississippi, for more repairs, the Navy said in a separate statement.

It said a heavy lift transport vessel, the Transshelf, will meet the Fitzgerald in deep water to begin lifting it to bring it back to the U.S.

Initial repairs to the Fitzgerald's hull and other structures were done in a dry dock at Yokosuka before she returned to the water for return to the U.S. for final repairs, the statement said.","pascagoula mississippi

The four protesters sat down in the parade route on Central Park West at 70th Street in Manhattan but were quickly carried off by NYPD police officers. A representative for the group that organized the demonstration, The Seed Project, said that none of the protesters were arrested or given citations.

The Seed Project

One of the protesters, Hector Martinez, 26, told ABC News he decided to take part in the demonstration ""to push for more protection for undocumented youth.""

The NYPD police officers carried the protesters out of the parade route and told them if they came back they would be arrested, Martinez said.

Martinez said he immigrated to the U.S. with his family from Colombia when he was 10 and obtained the right to work and study under the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

The Seed Project

DACA was started by President Barack Obama in 2012 through an executive action that allowed certain undocumented immigrants who were children when they were brought to the U.S. to remain in the country and be eligible to work and study if they meet certain requirements.

The Trump administration announced in September a plan to let the program expire. The Justice Department recommended to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House that the DHS should begin ""an orderly lawful wind down, including the cancellation of the memo that authorized this program,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at the time.

Martinez said that decision has created ""a time of great difficulty"" for Dreamers, who now face uncertainty as Congress debates a replacement to the program. The protection will begin to expire for the program's enrollees in March of 2018 if no action is taken.

Nearly 800,000 unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as children have been granted protection from deportation under the program.","department of homeland security

Some Republicans are hoping lawmakers will soon wrap up investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election that have dragged on for most of the year. But with new details in the probe emerging almost daily, that seems unlikely.

Three congressional committees are investigating Russian interference and whether President Donald Trump's campaign was in any way involved. The panels have obtained thousands of pages of documents from Trump's campaign and other officials, and have done dozens of interviews.

The probes are separate from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Mueller can prosecute for criminal activity, while Congress can only lay out findings, publicize any perceived wrongdoing and pass legislation to try to keep problems from happening again. If any committee finds evidence of criminal activity, it must refer the matter to Mueller.

All three committees have focused on a June 2016 meeting that Trump campaign officials held in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer and others. They are also looking into outreach by several other Russians to the campaign, including involvement of George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty this month to lying to the FBI as part of Mueller's probe. New threads continue to emerge, such as a recent revelation that Donald Trump Jr. was messaging with WikiLeaks, the website that leaked emails from top Democratic officials during the campaign.

A look at the committees that are investigating, and the status of their work when they return from their Thanksgiving break:

SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

The Senate intelligence panel, which has been the most bipartisan in its approach, has interviewed more than 100 people, including most of those attending the Trump Tower meeting. Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and the panel's top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, have said they plan to bring in Donald Trump Jr. The president's son was one of several Trump campaign officials in the meeting.

The committee has looked broadly at the issue of interference, and called in executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google, pushing them to take steps to prevent Russian election meddling on their platforms. Warner told The Associated Press the committee is still looking for more information from those companies, which were initially reluctant to cooperate.

Burr has said that he wants to wrap up the probe by early spring, when congressional primaries begin. While there are many areas of bipartisan agreement on the meddling, it's unclear whether all members will agree to the final report. It's also unclear if the report will make a strong statement on whether the Trump campaign colluded in any way with Russia.

Warner said it's plain there were ""unprecedented contacts"" as Russians reached out to the Trump campaign but what's not established is collusion.

———

HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

In the House, Democrats hope the intelligence committee can remain focused on the Russia probe as the panel's GOP chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, and other Republicans have launched new, separate investigations into Democrat Hillary Clinton and a uranium deal during President Barack Obama's administration. Nunes stepped back from the Russia probe in April after criticism that he was too close to the White House, but remains chairman of the committee.

Some Republicans on the panel have grown restless with the probe, saying it has amounted to a fishing expedition and pushing for it to end. Still, the committee has continued to interview dozens of witnesses involved with the Trump campaign, among them several participants in the 2016 meeting. On Nov. 30, the panel will interview Attorney General Jeff Sessions behind closed doors. Lawmakers are interested in Sessions' knowledge about interactions between Trump campaign aides and Russians, and also his own contacts.

The top Democrat on the panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, told AP the committee has multiple interviews before the New Year. He said the Republican investigations into Clinton and Obama could be ""an enormous time drain,"" but they have not yet fully organized. He says the committee must be thorough and he doesn't believe the Russia investigation should end soon.

———

SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

The Senate Judiciary Committee has also divided along partisan lines as Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panel's top Democrat, haven't agreed on some interviews and subpoenas. But as in the House, the panel has proceeded anyway, conducting bipartisan, closed-door interviews with several people who were in the 2016 meeting.

The panel is showing recent signs that it is aggressively pursuing the investigation. The committee is the only one to have interviewed Trump Jr. And just before the Thanksgiving break, it sent Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a letter asking him to be more forthcoming with the committee.

Grassley has been focused on a law that requires foreign agents to register and the firing of James Comey as FBI director. Along with the other committees, Judiciary is also looking into a dossier of allegations about Trump's own connections to Russia.

It's not known if the panel will issue a final report, or if its probe will conclude before next year's elections.","senate intelligence committee

The top lawman in Las Vegas says the gunman who killed dozens of people at a concert last month fired more than 1,100 rounds.

The newly released estimate from Sheriff Joe Lombardo offers more detail about the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Lombardo tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was aware of the previously unreported figure because his department's forensics lab is working with the FBI to process all ballistics evidence.

Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds more on Oct. 1 after he shattered windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the music festival below before killing himself.

Authorities have said they have not determined Paddock's motive or why he stopped shooting. Lombardo says authorities found about 4,000 unused rounds in the suite.","mandalay bay hotelcasino

Royce Kurmelovs,Security forces storm former Australian detention camp to remove hundreds of refugees refusing for weeks to leave.,2017-11-23T19:10:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Manus Island: Fears of violence as PNG forces enter,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/manus-island-fears-violence-png-forces-enter-171123184734251.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/23/f020398926874d8ba75d8a1385dc6a80_18.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Concerns for the safety of hundreds of refugees have been raised after Papua New Guinea security forces stormed a former detention camp and forcibly removed about 60 men who refused for weeks to leave.

The operation on Manus Island began early on Thursday when police issued an ultimatum to the refugees remaining in the camp, saying they had an hour to leave or they would be forced out.

Once the hour was up, officers swept through the facility destroying personal property and supplies of food and water that had been donated by sympathetic locals.

Australia pays Papua New Guinea and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru to hold thousands of asylum seekers from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia who have attempted to reach Australian shores by boat since mid-2013.

{articleGUID}

Iranian journalist and refugee applicant Behrouz Boochani was taken into custody after briefly speaking to Al Jazeera by phone.

""The immigration officers and so many special forces suddenly attacked the prison camp,"" Boochani said. ""Immigration officers and police are destroying everything … The refugees are saying 'We're not going to leave this prison camp and go to another prison camp.'""

The police, special forces, police squad are now in their hundreds, spreading through the prison camp and around the prison. Navy soldiers are outside the prison camp. We are on high alert right now. We are under attack. — Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017

About 60 men left the camp in buses, but some 300 others said they're too afraid to go outside the former Australian-run facility, fearing attacks by hostile locals.

The prison camp was closed last month after Papua New Guinea's supreme court ruled it was unconstitutional. Since then, the refugees have been living in increasingly filthy conditions without clean water, food, or medical supplies.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull denounced the holdout by the refugees.

""They think this is some way they can pressure the Australian government to let them come to Australia. Well, we will not be pressured. I want to be very clear about this … We will not outsource our migration policy to people smugglers,"" Turnbull said.

Earlier this month, Boochani was a winner of the Amnesty International Australian Media Awards in 2017 for his work covering daily life on Manus.

Social media posts by refugees said security officers appeared to target Boochani and a second man, Abdul Aziz Adam, who had been reporting on the siege since the standoff began.

They are looking for me and Behrouz they found him but they are not going to find me. These are police are taking Behrouz. pic.twitter.com/G01bA46ETC — Abdul Aziz Adam (@Aziz58825713) November 23, 2017

In response to Boochani's arrest, the Australian journalists union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, issued a statement from its Chief Executive Paul Murphy describing the situation as an attack on press freedom.

""Behrouz has been one of the main sources of factual information about conditions inside the Manus Island detention centre for the past few years, and his reporting has been published in Australia and internationally,"" Murphy said.

""His reporting in the finest traditions of journalism has been critical when the Australian and PNG governments have done everything they can to prevent media from having access to the asylum seekers on Manus Island.""

{articleGUID}

Boochani said he was released about two hours after being handcuffed behind the camp.

Besides food supplies and mobile phones, medicine for the sick was also allegedly destroyed by security officers.

Patrick McGorry, a professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, said the refugees were likely suffering from psychological problems as well.

""These men are chronically suicidal, they're extremely demoralised after four years of incarceration with no real hope about their future. Even though they are genuine refugees, there's really no clear plan for resettlement for them,"" McGorry said.

The UN refugee agency said in a statement the use of ""excessive force"" cannot be used against the holdouts.

""We urge both governments to engage in constructive dialogue, to de-escalate the current tensions and work on urgent lasting solutions to their plight,"" said Volker Turk, UNHCR's assistant high commissioner for protection.

Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton blamed destruciton at the camp on the refugees.

""They've trashed the facility. They're living in squalor,"" Dutton told local media. ""The Australian taxpayers have paid about $10m for a new facility - and we want people to move.""

Australia officially closed its Manus Island detention centre on October 31, but 600 men originally refused to leave citing fears for their safety.

While New Zealand made an offer to resettle 150 men, it was rejected by Australia's prime minister on the basis it may revive the people-smuggling trade.","manus island articleguid boochani

Marwan Bishara,Normalisation has failed before and will fail again.,2017-11-23T08:15:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Sadat to Salman: Israel at the expense of Palestine,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/sadat-salman-israel-expense-palestine-171123073734966.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/23/6dd888149bdb4ceeb2399f282730f822_18.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Israel and Saudi Arabia have been the hot subject of speculation and gossip in recent weeks. Not a day goes by without us hearing about their latest rendezvous, their winks and whims, their flirtations and fantasies.

I'm not sure Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman did indeed make a secret trip to Tel Aviv, but I did see former Saudi and Israeli intelligence chiefs share a stage at a New York synagogue last month.

The hilarity - or rather, the calamity - of the scene transcended the attempt at normality from former head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki Al Faisal, with his English gentleman's red socks, as he disagreed on stage with former Mossad director Efraim Halevy, as the latter argued in favour of maintaining the Iran nuclear deal. When an Israeli spymaster sounds like a moderate in comparison to his Saudi counterpart regarding a ""fellow Muslim nation"", it's time to be alarmed.

At any rate, since Prince Turki's ""flirtation"" with another former Israeli spy and ex-foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, in Davos in January, informal meetings and overtures between the Israelis and the Saudis seem to have multiplied. Bahrain and the UAE have also joined in. Their objective is to prepare the public for the shock of normalisation, to normalise the idea of future normalisation with Israel.

Love and hate

The attraction between the Wahabi and Zionist leaders may be neither halal nor kosher, but it's nonetheless strong and getting stronger. And it's nothing new.

Their rapprochement is born out of necessity and driven, primarily, by mutual aversion rather than mutual attraction: aversion to the Iranian regime and fear of its expanding influence in the region. As those feelings grow, so does their relationship, in accordance with the realist proverb: my enemy's enemy is my friend.

Indeed, US President Donald Trump noticed with great satisfaction the ""really good feeling towards Israel"" in Saudi Arabia after his May visit to both countries. Since then he's been godfathering a trilateral arrangement with Israel and Saudi Arabia to confront Iran's ""fanatical regime""and its regional aggression.

The Trump administration will fail to produce a credible and comprehensive peace strategy.

In an interview with the Saudi publication Elaph earlier this month - yet another sign of normalisation - Israel's military chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot, explained how Iran threatens both Saudi Arabia and Israel through not one but two parallel (Shia) crescents of influence that cross the region. To the north, one goes through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and to the Mediterranean Sea; and to the south, a second goes through the Gulf region, Yemen and to the banks of the Red Sea.

Marriages of convenience have been built on much less.

Gains and losses

Judging from their public declarations, Israelis are terribly impatient. They want to take the Saudi relationship to a whole new level; they want to ""go steady"" and they want to come out. And they want it yesterday. Their generation-old (wet) dream of public strategic engagement with moderate Sunni Arab regimes is finally coming true.

Israel has everything to gain and, if it can help it, nothing to lose, from the normalisation of relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. It could see its relations improve dramatically with many of the other 55 Muslim-majority countries, just as it saw a huge spike in its diplomatic and economic relations around the world after the 1993 Oslo Accords, including with the likes of Jordan and Qatar. Doha shut down Israel's trade office in the Gulf country in 2009 after the Israeli offensive on Gaza.

For Israel, shared strategic interests and shared goals with Saudi Arabia should suffice to normalise their relations and strengthen their union. But as Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz's latest revelations about Israel's long ""sharing of intelligence"" have shown, it's Riyadh, not Tel Aviv, that insists on secrecy out of a sense of shame.

When Saudi Arabia committed to a peace initiative that became an Arab League initiative in 2002, it expressed willingness to normalise relations with Israel but only after Israel's withdrawal from Palestinian and Arab territories and the establishment of a Palestinian state.

For Riyadh, quick and unconditional normalisation with its historical nemesis has long been a risky proposition for the kingdom and its regional standing. Even its more enthusiastic neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, has been, in the words of one Israeli expert, a silent partner.

Not any more.

New leadership, new policy

It was quite shocking to see the above-mentioned Saudi interview with Israeli chief of staff totally and utterly ignore the Palestinian issue. That's clearly no mistake or lapse of journalistic judgment - it's intentional. And it's politically motivated.

Has the Saudi (and UAE) leadership accepted Israel's generous offer on Iran in return for ignoring the plight of Palestine? Or does Riyadh still insist on Israel accepting the Arab initiative before formal normalisation begins?

It seems the Saudis and Israelis are waiting for clarifications and answers from President Trump's proposal - what he promises will be the ""ultimate deal"" to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. For example, will the US ask Israel to withdraw from East Jerusalem or will it pressure the Saudis to pressure the Palestinians to give up their right to a state and a capital? Or, perhaps, leave it in limbo?

Spare yourselves the suspense. The ""ultimate deal"" is the ultimate BS.

Why? Well, because the boy-wonder that Trump appointed as the best man for the job of resolving the century-old conflict is none other than his son-in-law, Jared Kushner - a lousy businessman and a religious Zionist, whose claim to fame is marrying the right girl at the right time. It's not even clear whether Kushner's White House career will survive the Russia investigation, since Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly after him for his role in the dismissal of FBI chief James Comey. Mueller is also looking into Kushner's secret policy coordination with Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu to undermine the Obama administration during a UN vote on Israeli illegal settlements in Palestine.

In my estimation, the Trump administration will fail to produce a credible and comprehensive peace strategy, and, like its predecessors, it will fail to resolve the ""Israel problem"" or stop the colonisation of Palestine. Likewise, the administration has no real actionable Iran strategy, and lacks the will and the intention to confront Iran in various hotspots of the greater Middle East.

Tweeting Iran into submission doesn't require Israeli or Saudi participation. Trump is more than capable.

Consequently, if the Saudi royals normalise with the ""Zionist usurpers"" of Jerusalem, they'll find out that they've been exposed on all fronts. They'll learn that Israel won't fight their battles for them. And they will also discover, rather late, that instead of putting Iran in a corner, normalisation with Israel in the absence of peace will empower and propagate Iran's role in the region.

And there's more.

Before the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques surrenders al-Aqsa to the ""Zionists"" or before the Salmans raise Israeli flags in Riyadh, it's worthwhile to consider the consequences of the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's normalisation with Israel. Bear in mind that Saudi Arabia, unlike Egypt, does not seek to liberate territories from Israeli occupation and desires no aid from the United States.

Four decades later...

Forty years ago this week, then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made a diplomatic splash when he visited Israel and spoke to the Knesset. It broke a psychological barrier in the Arab world, marked a turning point in the conflict with Israel, and saw the beginning of Egypt's official normalisation of relations with Israel.

Sadat cemented that process into a cold peace the following year, signing the Camp David accords, which guaranteed the return of occupied Sinai and billions of dollars in aid from the US, but neglected the occupied territories of the rest of the Arabs, including the Palestinians.

A militant Egyptian group assassinated Sadat during a military parade three years later, but his successor Hosni Mubarak continued to honour the agreement. Sinai was returned and the aid came through, but the bigger promise of modernisation, openness and peace dividend never really materialised, certainly not for ordinary Egyptians.

For the people of Egypt, normalisation with Israel never became normal. The Egyptian people remained mostly hostile or indifferent towards their neighbour to the north. And Palestine continued to be a rallying cause for Egyptian civil society, in their pursuit of justice and freedom from repression.

But for Israel, normalisation was a bounty. With its southern flanks secured, it began a large campaign of repression against Palestinians and escalation of its illegal settlement activities in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. Israel annexed the occupied Syrian Golan Heights in 1981. And in 1982, it invaded Lebanon to crush the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Lebanese National Movement, which led to tens of thousands of casualties. It maintained its occupation of southern Lebanon for the next 18 years. Israel's status was elevated soon after from US regional ally to global ""strategic asset"".

Forty years ago, there was no Palestinian Hamas and no Lebanese Hezbollah, no al-Qaeda and ISIL, and no Islamic Republic of Iran. But soon after the Camp David accords, Israeli aggression paved the way for the rise of Hamas and Hezbollah, just as Soviet and US aggression - coupled with Arab discord - plunged the region into chaos and paved the way for the rise of militant Islamists.

Betraying Palestine

The lessons couldn't be clearer. Arab autocrats, who fail in governance and in war, also fail in peace and normalisation.

Normalisation through weakness is the exact opposite of peace through strength, and therefore, is destined to fail. It is an idea that is tinged with betrayal: betrayal of common Arab interests, as well as the betrayal of Palestine.

For the people of the Arab world, Palestine has long been a rallying cause because it's about more than geography or a homeland for the Palestinian people. Palestine is the test of Arab conscience, the symbol of the struggle for freedom, not only from military occupation, but also from political repression at home.

Those who shed tears over Arab unity and national security in Cairo this week are the very regimes cooperating with Israel in secret. Their incompetence has paved the way for Israel, Iran and the US to run amok in the region.

When the regional hysteria finally ceases, when the hallucination subsides, history will cast a harsh judgment on the cynics who normalise with Israel at the expense of Palestine.","palestine liberation organization

Mariya Petkova,"How the Kremlin destroyed the far right in Russia, while backing it in the West.",2017-11-23T10:29:00Z,al-jazeera-english,The death of the Russian far right,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/11/death-russian-171123102640298.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/23/fc298f59c3af4ddaa8df5c75a2786547_18.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"On November 4, a few hundred people gathered for the annual ultranationalist ""Russian march"" in Moscow. With chants like ""Glory to Russia"" and ""Freedom for political prisoners"", the demonstrators tried to march through the Lyublino neighbourhood of Moscow, before the police dispersed the crowd, arresting dozens.

But this year's march was a far cry from what it used to be in the late 2000s and early 2010s when thousands of people would join well-organised columns replete with banners, flags and drummers.

Today, most of the leaders of the ultranationalist groups that used to organise the march are either in jail or in self-imposed exile. Their supporters consider them to be politically persecuted and complain about increasing state repression.

Although the Kremlin has been accused of supporting conservative and far-right political groups in Europe, at home it seems to be becoming increasingly intolerant towards groups that propagate ideas similar to their Western counterparts.

In the past few years, and especially since the conflict in Ukraine erupted in 2014, the Russian authorities have cracked down on nationalist groups under the guise of criminal investigations or accusations of extremism under the infamous ""anti-extremism"" Law 282.

'Controlled nationalism'

In the early 2000s, Russian President Vladimir Putin was finishing his first presidential term when two colour revolutions struck nearby - the first in Georgia in 2013 and the second in Ukraine in 2014. Large crowds in Tbilisi and Kiev demanded democratic change and major political reforms. The possibility of a colour revolution erupting in Russia seemed too real.

It was then that the Kremlin looked to the right. Russian observers would later identify this strategy of employing nationalist forces as ""controlled nationalism"".

""Controlled nationalism is about using nationalists in some [political] games. In some cases, [the authorities] would support nationalists in order to keep the regime alive, to fight the threat of a colour revolution,"" says Anton Shekhovstov, visiting fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Austria.

""They thought that if they supported those ultranationalist movements, they would decrease the opportunity of nationalists becoming a force that would destabilise the regime,"" he explains.

In early 2005, in response to the colour revolutions, the International Eurasian movement, headed by Alexander Dugin, a right-wing political scientist and ideologue (whom Western journalists eventually nicknamed ""Putin's Rasputin"") createda youth wing, the Eurasian Youth Union (ESM). Its aim was to whip up nationalist sentiment and mobilise young people against anti-government attitudes.

That same year, the Russian authorities decided to finally do away with the November 7 official holiday celebrating the October Revolution. They moved the allocated day off to November 4 - the day Moscow was liberated from the Poles in 1612, an official holiday in tsarist Russia until 1917.

The authorities named the new holiday ""National Unity Day"", but there wasn't much public enthusiasm for it and most Russians didn't even know its history. So when the ESM requested to hold a right-wing march on that day, the local authorities readily obliged.

Other ultranationalist organisations and skinhead groups joined the ESM and the turnout that year surprised many: Some 3,000 people marched, chanting ""Glory to Russia"" and ""Russians forward"", as young men made Nazi salutes in front of TV cameras.

In the years that followed, the ESM was pushed out of the organising committee of the march for being too pro-Kremlin and two other groups took the lead: the Movement Against Illegal Immigration (DPNI) and the Slavic Union (SS). The DPNI was led by Alexander Potkin, who changed his name to Belov (""bely"" in Russian means white) and the SS was headed by Dmitry Dyomushkin. Both men are now in jail.

""Belov was my assistant in the Duma. He became an opportunist and has ended up in jail,"" says Andrei Savelev, founder and leader of the ""Great Russia"" nationalist movement, who was elected to the Duma in 2003. At around the same time, Dyomushkin was an assistant to another member of the Duma during that period, Nikolay Kuryanovich from the pro-Kremlin ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.

""Аll these years Dyomushkin was surprisingly untouchable. He was doing things for which others would go to jail. For four to five years, the justice system did not touch him,"" says Savelev.

According to him, Dyomushkin and Belov were coopted by the Russian authorities. He says this was why he withdrew his organisation from the Russian march.

Ivan Beletsky, a close associate of Dyomushkin who took over organising the march in 2016, rejects the idea of cooptation and claims that ""Great Russia"" is a pro-government group. He says that the authorities tried but failed to take control of the Russian march in the late 2000s and were compelled to permit it in order to ""cool down popular agitation"".

""The Russian march is a protest march: against the government, against corruption, and for a change of power,"" he says, speaking to Al Jazeera via Skype from a location outside of Russia that he refused to disclose.

In July 2011, Dyomushkin and Belov caused a stir within the ultranationalist movement for going to Chechnya and meeting with its president, Ramazan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, despite their anti-Chechen and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Dyomushkin subsequently went to Grozny a number of times.

In August 2011, DPNI was banned by the Russian government (the SS had been banned a year earlier). Nevertheless, the government allowed the Russian march to take place. On November 4, more than 10,000 nationalists, joined by opposition politicians like Alexei Navalny, marched in Lyublino with banners reading ""Stop feeding Caucasus"". Over the years, the central government has been perceived as being quite generous in its budget allocation to the Chechen Republic in the North Caucasus and has been criticised by both nationalists and liberals for it.

In 2012, ultranationalist organisations participating in the Russian march backed anti-government protests. The merger between regular opposition and nationalists worried the government and the Federal Security Service (FSB) considered it a potentially ""revolutionary situation"", says Beletsky.

Schism in the far right and crackdown

The events of 2014 in Ukraine caught the ultranationalist groups in Russia by surprise. On one hand, the Kremlin was employing strong nationalist rhetoric claiming Crimea was ""rightfully"" Russian and that ethnic Russians living in Ukraine had to be protected; on the other, fellow Ukrainian far-right groups were supporting the Maidan and opposing the annexation.

""In 2014, the Kremlin demanded full loyalty from all Russian nationalists,"" says Shekhovtsov. ""Some of them declined to become loyal to the Kremlin.""

The result was a ""schism"" in the nationalist movement with one camp supporting the annexation of Crimea and the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and the other opposing both and supporting the Ukrainian central government.

""We right-wing nationalists - we consider [the breakaway regions in Eastern Ukraine] Putin's machinations. We stood up against this and we suffered fierce repressions,"" says Beletsky.

On November 4, 2014, there were two events in Moscow that claimed to be the Russian march - one supporting the annexation of Crimea and the other rejecting it. In the following months, one by one leaders of ultranationalist groups supporting the latter were arrested on various charges.

In 2015, Belov was arrested and a year later convicted on charges of money laundering related to a Kazakh bank and spreading extremism among Russian-speaking Kazakh citizens. He was sentenced to seven and a half years in jail.

In 2016, Dyomushkin was arrested for posting a photo of a previous Russian march in which a banner saying ""Russian power in Russia"" was visible. He was accused of spreading ""extremism"" and handed two and a half years in prison. A previous court case against him on similar charges dating from 2011 ended in early 2014 without a sentence due to an expiration of the statute of limitations.

According to his lawyer, Dmitry Baharev, who also used to be a member of the SS, the case against him is politically motivated.

""Usually for pictures, they give suspended sentences, but Dyomushkin got prison,"" he says. ""In my opinion, this is connected with the events in Ukraine.""

Another close associate of Dyomushkin and Belov and a frequent Russian march attendee, Georgy Borovikov, а leader of the banned National Patriotic Front ""Memory"" was arrested and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison in 2014 for robbery and torture.

Other far-right leaders managed to escape before being arrested. Beletsky says he fled the country fearing arrest as he was questioned multiple times and briefly detained this year after organising nationalists to join Navalny for an anti-government protest in March.

Yury Gorsky, also an organiser of the Russian march and former member of various ultranationalist groups, was charged with spreading extremism and is currently in Lithuania. Igor Artyomov, the former leader of the banned Russian All-National Union, which also used to participate in the march, received political asylum in the US.

Prominent ultranationalist vlogger Vyacheslav Maltsev, who at some point was associated with ""Great Russia"" and also attended Russian marches, fled from Russia after being briefly detained and is currently in hiding in a European country. Maltsev called for a ""revolution"" on November 5. Many of his supporters had previously been or were subsequently arrested.

Human rights groups have been divided over whether or not to consider the detention and imprisonment of ultranationalists to be political prosecution. Human rights organisation ""Memorial"" considers that in the case of Belov, there are ""signs of political motivation"".

""All of these big nationalist leaders are guilty, not necessarily of what they accuse them of, but there is a lot of other things they did. The authorities have not undertaken to sort out these things because it is too difficult or long, so they stuck on them whatever they could,"" says Natalya Yudina, a researcher at ""Sova Centre"" which focuses on extremism and violations of human rights in Russia. She says that the centre does not consider Belov a political prisoner and that members of the organisations which he and Dyomushkin led committed violent attacks in the past.

Promoting destabilisation abroad, preempting it at home

While the Kremlin was cracking down on the far right at home, in the West, it was seeking its support.

According to Shekhovtsov, the Kremlin launched efforts to establish relations with ultranationalist groups in Europe as early as 2008.

""[In 2008,] many in the Russian elite circles believed that Russia may have won the war with Georgia in military terms but it failed to win the information war and convince the West or the international community that Russia's actions were justified,"" he says.

Russian national and international media sought to feature Western commentators sympathetic to Russia's actions in Georgia, but could not find any in the mainstream; the ones that would openly express support were mostly on the far right, explains Shekhovtsov.

In the following years, the Kremlin invested a lot of effort into nourishing ties with far-right groups and parties in the West. The Russian authorities would organise ultranationalist conferences, back media initiatives, and establish formal agreements with far-right parties.

Currently, the ruling United Russia party has established cooperation agreements with the Northern League in Italy and the Freedom Party in Austria. In 2014, the National Front in France borrowed nearly $13m in Russian bank loans.

Various other ultranationalist groups in the EU are said to have ties to Russia: from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) to Ataka Party in Bulgaria.

Shekhovtsov, who wrote a book on the subject, points out that Russian efforts to court Europe's far right have not rendered major victories, such as the suspension of sanctions against Moscow in place since the annexation of Crimea. But the growing strength of far-right groups has had a destabilising effect across Europe.

In Germany, the AfD, which hardly managed to clear the five percent threshold in the 2013 elections, this year won 12.6 percent and is the third-largest party in the Bundestag after the September elections. Some commentators have attributed that success to Russian backing.

At home, the Kremlin preempted such a scenario.

""[Today] the anti-Putin far-right movement is extremely small. You cannot compare this to any other period of time in Russia [since 1991] where you would have such a weak [ultranationalist] movement,"" says Shekhovtsov.

According to him, some ultranationalist groups have already changed strategy to accommodate the regime. At the same time, since 2014, a number of ""patriotic"" and ultra-Orthodox organisations have emerged which have also been accused of attacks, but not on minorities or migrants; their victims have mostly been opposition activists, like Navalny, and liberals.

""The classical Russian nationalism, in its ethnic form, is a thing of the past. There are new movements that are appearing now, which are connected with the Kremlin ideologically,"" says Yudina. ""The main thing for them is patriotism, the praise of our state, and adopting conservative, Orthodox values.""

Yudina says that in recent years hate attacks on minorities and migrants have decreased tenfold - from a few hundred in the late 2000s to a few dozen in 2016. Yet attacks on the LGBT community have persisted, as the new ""patriotic"" and ultra-Orthodox groups consider them ""freaks"".

""All this scares me. This it seems to me will be the future. Aggressive Orthodox organisations will be getting stronger,"" she says.

Tamila Varshalomidze,"Local media draw unverified links between ethnic Chechens and special forces raid, upsetting minority Muslim community.",2017-11-23T09:39:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Speculation rife as Georgia stays mum on raid suspects,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/speculation-rife-georgia-stays-mum-raid-suspects-171123061439758.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/23/b10f4a06c4ca4a22a5cef50171eeb80a_18.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Georgia's government has remained silent about the nationality of foreign gunmen killed in a large-scale police operation in Tbilisi on Wednesday.

Officials said they would not comment on the identity of the suspects, as the investigation is ongoing, while Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili said their nationality or ethnicity did ""not matter"".

The lack of verified information prompted speculation about the incident, in which security forces battled with unidentified armed men for almost 24 hours in an apartment block on the outskirts of the capital.

The special forces operation ended with four deaths, including three suspects and one security officer.

Local media reported the suspects' apartment was owned by an ethnic Chechen, leading to assumptions that Chechens were involved in the incident.

""Nothing is really known about what happened yesterday,"" said Sulkhan Bordzikashvili, an ethnic Chechen from Pankisi Valley, an area of east Georgia dominated by the ethnicity from neighbouring Russia's autonomous republic of Chechnya.

""It is still unknown who they [the criminals] were, but it [the incident] was very casually pinned on Pankisi,"" Bordzikashvili added.

""Now even if the investigation shows that they were not from Pankisi, public opinion will remain negative towards it. In social media, people started bashing ethnic Chechens from early on,"" he told Al Jazeera in a phone interview from Tbilisi.

""'They should be exiled', 'they should be killed', such messages are circulating on social media from different profiles since yesterday. It's a terrible story.""

Pankisi Valley, 160km northeast from Tbilisi, is a majority Sunni Muslim part of predominantly Orthodox Christian Georgia.

The area is seen by many Georgians as dangerous due to the presence of anti-Russian fighters, who sheltered there from neighbouring Chechnya during the second Russian-Chechen war in the 1990s, and many cases of abductions and killings in that period.

Most recently it attracted negative attention due to the large amount of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) recruits that joined the armed group under the leadership of Pankisi resident late Tarkhan Batirashvili, also known as Omar al-Shishani.

However, since the death of Batirashvili and Georgia's crackdown on local ISIL recruiters two years ago, Pankisi's bad image started to fade.

""In the last couple of years, things were improving. We're trying to do everything to improve things, we're waiting for tourism to take off, and now all of a sudden Pankisi's name is linked to terrorists,"" Leila Avchashvili, Pankisi resident and mother of two late ISIL fighters, told Al Jazeera from her village of Jokolo.

""What happened is a deplorable fact. We are all very concerned of course, like any level-headed person,"" she said.

""We, Pankisi Valley residents, know the value of peace and solidarity. We should wait for the results of the investigation. It will be very regrettable if Pankisi is linked to terrorism.""

'It does not matter'

Giorgi Kvirikashvili, Georgia's prime minister, called on the public not to emphasise the ethnicity or nationality of the criminals.

""It does not matter, which country's citizens they are. We should not emphasise their ethnicity and nationality,"" he said, answering a question about the identity of the gunmen. ""Fact is that they rejected a peaceful offer to surrender to the police, answering by shooting,"" Kvirikashvili said.

Georgian media coverage of the incident was criticised by the Georgian Charter of Journalistic Ethics, a non-profit organisation, for ""referring to citizens as 'terrorists' based on unverified information and linking them to a certain ethnic group"".

""Such information only kindles negative stereotypes and helps stigmatisation,"" the charter said in a statement, calling on media organisations to avoid reporting unverified comments.

Local media was broadcasting live from the scene of the unrest on Wednesday, showing the security forces' manoeuvres from a distance with a slight delay in time to avoid compromising the operation.

The live coverage prompted criticism from various organisations, officials who deemed it irresponsible journalism due to the risks involved on all sides.

""Media has a responsibility to refrain from reporting in detail on anti-terrorism or defence actions, which could result in a radical group's change of action and the failure of an operation,"" the charter said.

Mariam Gaprindashvili, who was reporting live from the scene for about 18 hours on Wednesday for the private television station, Rustavi 2, told Al Jazeera that she and her colleagues were covering the incident from outside the cordoned-off area.

""It was the largest cordoned-off territory I have ever seen, about 5km,"" she said. ""The operation lasted so long that it seems the gunmen were very well prepared for the fight.""

Nika Rurua, a member of National Movement opposition party, told Al Jazeera that it was not the time for blaming anyone for their role in the incident, including the government.

""Wednesday's events point to the crumbling of the security system in the country. How come these people with such a big stash of weapons that are not even sold in Georgia have gone unnoticed for two years [of their alleged residency in the apartment],"" he said.

""I hope now the incident will be investigated thoroughly and the public will find out who these people were and how so much weaponry was amassed by them.""

But this is no ordinary television news station. It's fully staffed by Rohingya refugees broadcasting online, sharing news and information from Myanmar, Bangladesh and beyond. It's essentially refugee TV, brought to you from studios in Malaysia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.

Sitting at the news anchor desk is Arifa Sultana, a 23-year-old Rohingya journalist. Her family fled from Myanmar's restive Rakhine state to Bangladesh a mere 11 months after her birth in 1994.

Myanmar's government has deprived the Rohingya of citizenship since 1982. But as Azeem Ibrahim points out in his book, The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide, the campaign to exclude them as an official minority group began with Burma's founding 1947 constitution.

Generations of Rohingya have been rendered stateless, and it seems a concerted effort to force them out of their homes and into squalid refugee camps has been undertaken by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's armed forces.

{articleGUID}

The Tatmadaw argues it is doing ""security clearance"" in northern Rakhine state, and has issued its own report denying any wrongdoing since these operations began following attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on August 25.

""Everybody knows that we are Rohingya but when it comes to documentation, there's no legal proof,"" Sultana told Al Jazeera. ""This is the biggest challenge I'm facing now.""

Three years ago, Sultana came to Malaysia before the country temporarily sealed its borders to refugees fleeing Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2015.

Sultana wanted to continue her studies, and possibly attend a college. She quickly ran into the problem all Rohingya refugees do - the lack of necessary documentation to allow her to study legally in Malaysia.

""I'm sure there are many Rohingya like me who are more talented and educated,"" Sultana said. ""They have a lot of capability and potential but this is a restriction for them.""

Sultana turned to journalism. She began volunteering when she was 19 years old at Rohingya Vision TV, known as RVision to its staff and audience. It broadcasts in Rohingya, English, and Arabic.

Sultana has been offered many opportunities to travel outside of Malaysia for professional journalism training, but she fears that she will not be allowed to return.

""When I started working here I was very emotional hearing all these stories. But now it's part of my daily work schedule,"" she said. ""Thankfully, I have some senior editors who've guided me along the way.""

Ziaur Rahman, 24, is the Rohingya community's most outspoken advocate in the country. He's discussed the crimes perpetrated against the Rohingya directly with Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak three times.

""In Malaysia, we are not getting any protection, were not getting any support from NGOs [non-governmental organisations]. We don't have any rights,"" Rahman said.

{articleGUID}

Refugees in Malaysia have no legal status, so they can't officially work or attend government-run schools. But Malaysia has allowed space for a ""parallel school system"", according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.

These informal primary schools around Malaysia are set up and run by the refugee community itself, or faith-based organisations. The UNHCR directly supports 120 of these refugee schools.

There are 150,000 Rohingya refugees registered with the UNHCR in Malaysia. Some refugee children as old as 18 attend primary level classes.

The Prime Minister's Office said there are 16,809 Rohingya children carrying UNHCR cards, essentially allowing them and family members a discount on medical services at hospitals in Malaysia.

Rohingya Society Malaysia (RSM) is the only refugee community group recognised by the UNHCR. Its President Bo Min Naing said there are nearly 40,000 Rohingya still unregistered.

Sultana and Rahman say the UNHCR card doesn't provide any security or legality in Malaysia. Refugees often work illegally to provide for their families.

Malaysia has no intention to help refugees assimilate or study in government-run schools, fearing more will come. It's providing vital aid to Rohingya displaced in Myanmar and Bangladesh, but refugees argue nothing is being done to help those in Malaysia.

""The UN is doing a lot for us, but it's not doing enough,"" Sultana said. ""Even after getting the card you're liable to be harassed on the road [by authorities]. If you have no education and your children cannot receive education, what is the point of having a [UNHCR] card?""

RSM has supported 126 students since 2009 at its informal Rohingya Learning Centre. Despite its limitation of only three volunteer teachers, it hopes to one day be able to go beyond basic primary education and offer secondary-level classes.

{articleGUID}

""Our children need education,"" said Bo Min Naing. ""We need to have the opportunity to send our children to the government school until we are able to provide it.""

Rahman said he will speak about the necessity of improving refugee education next time he meets with Malaysia's prime minister. Sultana said she feels responsible for Rohingya's lack of education and voice in the international community.

This is why she loves working as a journalist, reaching her audience online, where many Rohingya refugees have turned to learn about the fate of their loved ones.

""We are denied all human rights. We have no legal documentation. I feel that if I don't raise [this issue], people will not come to help us solve it,"" she said.","rohingya refugees broadcasting online sharing news

Nidzara Ahmetasevic,"Another war criminal from the Yugoslav war has been handed a sentence, but lessons remain unlearned.",2017-11-22T16:44:00Z,al-jazeera-english,The Ratko Mladic disease infecting Europe,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/ratko-mladic-disease-infecting-europe-171122164225395.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/22/b9cc1d244b604e24a5da76f5fd24d76c_18.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Ratko Mladic, war-time Chief Commander of the Army of Republika Srpska, has been found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995, and genocide committed in the city of Srebrenica in July 1995.

The judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) said that Mladic has been found guilty for some of the most horrendous crimes known to humanity. And he will spend the rest of his life in prison.

This verdict will not change anything in the lives of people in Bosnia, or those living in the diaspora around the world. But at least we can comfort ourselves that some kind of justice does exist in this world and that those who are responsible for such horrific crimes, sooner or later, will end up in prison.

At least, that is how I felt, while sitting in the courtroom and listening to the judge reading the verdict. But there is still one question that bothers me: What did we learn from the Yugoslav wars, if we learned anything at all?

Ratko Mladic and war-time Republika Srpska President Radovan Karadzic (sentenced to 40 years in prison by the ICTY) started their bloody campaign in 1992. Under their command, people were mercilessly killed, raped, tortured, expelled from their homes, burned alive, and mutilated. All that was happening in the heart of Europe, while the European Union and its institutions were being established, celebrated, and praised as something that would bring hope, peace and stability for all.

A new Europe was born and people were promised to live in unity and solidarity, under the rule of law, in respect of human and civil rights. However, that Europe was not wise or brave enough to find a way to prevent, or, at least, to stop the killings in its very heart.

While they were lying to themselves that it can only happen to us, in the Balkans, they were closing their eyes to the growing, far-right movement.

European and other Western leaders were hesitant, back then, to call Mladic and Karadzic war criminals, or name what they were doing a genocide. They did not want to compare their killing campaign to Nazi mass murders, or to call their ideas fascist.

Instead, they were trying to find a way to negotiate with murderers, while using gentle terms to describe what was going on in Bosnia, like ""ethnic cleansing"", ""conflict"", or ""civil war"". It took them a long time to even recognise that war crimes were committed. Then, it took them almost four years to act and stop the war, four years that cost us over 100,000 lives and more than 2 million refugees.

When they finally stopped the war, making all these people with blood on their hands sign a peace agreement, it took years again to find a way to prosecute them. The processes were long and dreadful, and some, like the one for Slobodan Milosevic, former president of Serbia, never really ended; he died before the verdict was pronounced.

People from Bosnia suffered a lot because of this, and we still live the consequences of European hesitation. But these consequences I can see now everywhere around the world.

By not reacting on time to stop mass crimes being committed, Western leaders sent a message to everybody in the world that it is OK to kill other people, and to promote dangerous, ultranationalist ideas. That it is OK to commit genocide, and the world will pretend it is something else, just a small regional conflict among some tribal people. That it is OK to be a fascist, but just call it something else.

While they were lying to themselves that it can only happen to us, in the Balkans, they were closing their eyes to the growing far-right movement and rebirth of fascism all over Europe and the world.

{articleGUID}

If the Karadzic's and Mladic's of the Balkans had been stopped on time, and their ideas proclaimed dangerous, it could have been a clear message to all those who support ultranationalist and fascist ideas. But, everybody forgot the lesson we should have learned in the 1990s in Yugoslavia - that fascism is like a disease; it spreads easily and can infect anyone.

And in my own country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, it seems we also haven't learned anything for the past 25 years. Nothing, after all the pain we lived and continue to live through.

We did not learn not to trust nationalist politicians. They still rule the country, while constantly keeping old fears alive and reminding us all that we are nothing else but victims. The word ""survivor"" has not been introduced to our post-war lives yet.

We did not learn how not to have confidence in the international community, whatever is meant by that term. Today, most Balkan people still expect salvation to come from the outside. We still think we are unable to do it ourselves.

We are still unable to stop being victims and become survivors, and move on with our lives. Or start from the beginning. Anything, just to move forward.

After years of waiting, one more monster - Ratko Mladic - has been punished for what he did. But, unfortunately, I cannot say that his doings and his ideas have been eliminated in the process. They are not even defeated.

On May 28, 1992, I was wounded by shrapnel at my home in Sarajevo. That day, Mladic had ordered his soldiers to use all available ammunition to shoot at our city; ""Blow their minds away,"" he told them.

He not only blew our minds away, but he also left a time-resistant ideological crater in the heart of Europe. There was nobody to stop him and put him in prison years ago, so his ideas spread like a drug-resistant bug, adjusting to different circumstances and times.

I can hear Mladic and Karadzic in the words of many far-right leaders in Europe and around the world today. I can hear them in the words of people who are justifying wars and war crimes. I can hear them in policies of closed borders and ""national security"".

However, unlike many others in today's Europe, I can hear them and recognise them. And, unlike many others, that makes me worried.

Patrick Strickland,Humanitarian agencies call on Greek authorities to ensure that no refugees are in tents as winter weather approaches.,2017-11-22T20:59:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Rights groups urge Greece to end 'containment policy',http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/rights-groups-urge-greece-containment-policy-171122204019045.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/10/23/b66608319090426cafd8c3ac0851b960_18.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"With winter weather nearing, 20 humanitarian groups have warned authorities in Greece that ""lives will be lost"" unless asylum seekers stranded in cramped and unsafe island camps are allowed to relocate to the mainland.

In a joint statement on Wednesday, the Greek and international organisations said thousands of people faced the bleak prospect of being forced to endure freezing temperatures in summer tents.

""This remains a matter of life and death,"" Jana Frey, Greece country director for the International Rescue Committee, said in the statement.

""There is absolutely no excuse for the conditions on the islands right now - thousands of people crammed into overcrowded and desperately under-resourced facilities,"" she added, calling for asylum seekers to be ""allowed to move, in an organised and voluntary fashion, to the mainland"".

Hotspots on the islands of Lesbos, Samos and Chios were hosting 7,000 more people than they were designed to accommodate as of November 20, according to the human rights and aid groups.

""Nothing can justify trapping people in these terrible conditions on the islands for another winter,"" said Eva Cosse, Greece researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), in the statement.

'End containment policy'

In March 2016, the EU and Turkey reached a deal to stem the flow of refugees from Turkey to Europe, while countries across the Balkans sealed their borders. Those measures have led to a build-up of more than 60,000 refugees and migrants in Greece.

Barring emergencies, asylum seekers are banned from travelling to mainland Greece, where better conditions and services are available, until their asylum process has been completed.

""Following the EU-Turkey statement, asylum seekers may wait for lengthy periods to complete procedures, in some cases over a year,"" Boris Cheshirkov, spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR), told Al Jazeera.

""These delays have contributed to the present overcrowded conditions in the hotspots and the effects of the geographical restriction which keeps asylum seekers on the islands for extended periods must be considered.""

{articleGUID}

In their statement, the prominent groups called on Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to end ""the containment policy"" and take the necessary precautions to ensure that no asylum seekers are sleeping in tents before severe winter weather arrives.

The Greek Ministry of Migration did not reply to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.

Among the groups that signed the statement were IRC, HRW, Amnesty International, ActionAid, Help Refugees and others.

'Open-air detention camp'

Their warning comes amid soaring tensions on Greek islands, where the presence of refugees has become the subject of protests by locals and measures by law enforcement.

In Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, police on Tuesday reportedly evicted several people when a group of hunger-striking refugees camped out in the town's square refused to be transferred to another area outside the centre.

Also on Tuesday, local media reported that at least seven refugees were arrested in the Moria camp, a closed facility, for arson, attempting to cause bodily injury, disruption of the peace and other violations.

The arrests came a day after residents of Lesbos went on strike against the presence of more than 8,500 asylum seekers on the island.

Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, insisted that the island's inhabitants have ""struggled day and night for months on to shelter people who suffered from the consequences of war"" throughout the last three years.

Around a million refugees passed through the island during that period, he added.

{articleGUID}

""Today though, we feel abandoned and forgotten by both the Greek government and the European Union, as both our community and the refugees are getting punished,"" he told Al Jazeera on Wednesday.

""For months now, I kept appealing to both Athens and Brussels to take action as the refugee crisis is intensifying again.""

Galinos added: ""Lesbos, an island of democracy, humanity, and culture, is slowly turning into an open-air detention camp, a large jail where refugees are living under abhorrent conditions, and our community is coming under unbearable pressure, risking falling prey to extremist and populist rhetoric.""

'Dangerous for children'

More than 25,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Aegean Sea to Greek islands from Turkey so far this year, according to the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR). Of that total, children make up more than 37 percent.

The majority of arrivals have fled war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Cheshirkov, the UNHCR spokesman, explained that the humanitarian situation on the islands has rapidly declined amid increasing refugee arrivals.

On Lesbos, more than 6,000 people are crowded in the Moria camp, which was designed to hold less than 2,000.

""Right now, it is dangerous for children, families, and vulnerable people to stay in Moria. Conditions could still deteriorate if overcrowding persists and as colder weather sets in,"" Cheshirkov told Al Jazeera by email.

{articleGUID}

In Vial, a camp on Chios, more than 2,000 people live in a space meant to hold 1,000, he added.

On Samos, more than 1,600 are crammed in a camp equipped for 700, according to Cheshirkov.

Speaking to the Greek daily Ekathimerini earlier this month, Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas defended the Greek government's policy towards asylum seekers and the EU-Turkey deal.

""Despite the difficulties of [the deal], which has gray areas Europe must clarify, it is a useful agreement for Greece,” he said.

""Migration and refugee flows of this magnitude have to be dealt with, with agreements of this sort.""","international rescue committee

Timothy B. Lee,"South Australia battery installation has 100 MW capacity, a world record.",2017-11-23T20:20:05+00:00,ars-technica,"Elon Musk wins bet, finishing massive battery installation in 100 days",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/elon-musk-wins-bet-finishing-massive-battery-installation-in-100-days/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-10-01-at-1.26.11-PM-760x380.png,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Tesla has completed construction of a massive 100 megawatt, 129 MWh battery installation in South Australia. The new facility boasts the largest megawatt rating for any grid-connected battery installation in the world.

The project was completed less than two months after the contract was signed on September 29, putting it ahead of schedule. Musk had promised Australian authorities that he would complete the project in 100 days or the project would be free. Musk has said it would cost Tesla ""$50 million or more"" if the company failed to meet the deadline.

""Congratulations to the Tesla crew and South Australian authorities who worked so hard to get this manufactured and installed in record time!"" Musk tweeted late on Wednesday night (Thursday in Australia).

The state of South Australia saw a need to beef up its electricity infrastructure after a September 2016 storm caused a state-wide blackout. State officials wanted to ensure that didn't happen again, and they wanted to find a solution that made use of renewable energy.

The Hornsdale Wind Farm near Jamestown, South Australia, produces 315 megawatts of electricity, but like any wind farm it's not a steady source of power. So Tesla's batteries will charge up during periods when the wind farm is producing excess energy, then supply extra power to the grid during periods of peak demand.

Tesla's involvement in the project originated from a March Twitter conversation between Musk and Australian billionaire and software entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes. Musk said that if he got the contract, ""Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free.""

Tesla won a competitive bidding process in July and signed the contract in September. The system needs to undergo a few days of testing and is expected to be put into operation in early December.

Tesla is normally thought of as a car company, but this announcement underscores the fact that Tesla is really a battery company that happens to put some of the batteries in cars. It has built a massive battery factory in Nevada and needs to make sure it can sell the correspondingly massive number of batteries that factory will be producing in the coming years.

Of course most of those batteries are supposed to go into Tesla's cars. But developing a side business in battery packs for use by residential customers and electric utilities helps to diversify Tesla's business. If the car business hits unexpected snags—as it has with the Model 3 launch in recent months—Tesla can sell the extra batteries for non-car uses.

And it's going to take a lot more installations like the one in South Australia if the world is going to ultimately wean itself off of fossil fuels. Wind and solar energy are becoming increasingly affordable, but both types of power produce energy intermittently. Huge battery installations ensuring that utilities can supply households with electricity even when the supply of renewable electrons fluctuates.","jamestown south australia

Cyrus Farivar,Lawyer who brought case the day after Snowden revelations vows to appeal.,2017-11-23T17:00:40+00:00,ars-technica,Judge who once ruled against NSA metadata program tosses lawsuit,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/judge-dismisses-lawsuits-filed-back-in-2013-over-nsa-bulk-surveillance/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-488885285-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Further Reading In 2015, promising surveillance cases ran into legal brick walls A federal judge in Washington, DC has dismissed two long-running lawsuits that aimed to shed light on the often secretive surveillance state. As the National Security Agency’s metadata program no longer exists, the cases are now moot.

""This Court, in the final analysis, has no choice but to dismiss these cases for plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate the necessary jurisdiction to proceed,"" US District Judge Richard Leon wrote on November 21. ""I do so today, however, well aware that I will not be the last District Judge who will be required to determine the appropriate balance between our national security and privacy interests during this never-ending war on terror.""

The original version of this case, known as Klayman v. Obama, was filed by well-known conservative activist attorney Larry Klayman on June 7, 2013—the day after the Snowden revelations became public. The complaint argued that the National Security Agency’s telephone metadata program (""Section 215""), which gathered records of all incoming and outgoing calls for years on end, was unconstitutional.

Eventually, Judge Leon ruled in favor of plaintiff and attorney Larry Klayman in December 2013, ordering that the NSA’s program be immediately halted.

Further Reading Updated: Federal judge finds NSA phone spying likely unconstitutional However, the judge famously stayed his order pending an appeal to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. The DC Circuit reversed his order in August 2015 and sent it back down to Judge Leon. The DC Circuit found (as has often been the case) that Klayman did not have standing as there was not enough evidence that his records had been collected.

Judge Leon next suggested that the case be amended to include a specific plaintiff that had been a customer of Verizon Business Services, not Verizon Wireless. That person, California lawyer J.J. Little, was soon found and added to the case. The judge then ruled on November 9, 2015 that the government be ordered to immediately stop collecting Little’s records.

The government again appealed the decision back to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. Weeks later, though, the phone metadata program authorized under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act ended on November 29, 2015. As such, the government said in December 2015 that it would formally appeal Judge Leon’s decision, largely on the basis that it’s now moot.

The DC Circuit ruled in favor of the government, sending the case back down to Judge Leon. Again, the government moved to have the case dismissed, which Judge Leon ultimately agreed with this month.

On Wednesday, Klayman, who did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, told the Wall Street Journal that he would prepare for a third round of appeals.

""He took an exit stage left on this case, but we’re hopeful about the live case,"" Klayman said. ""I thank the judge for what he did in the past, but he made a mistake on this.""","national security agency’s metadata

Valentina Palladino,Ars details everything you need to know before buying any Echo device.,2017-11-23T16:30:23+00:00,ars-technica,"Guidemaster: Want an Alexa device? Here’s every Amazon Echo, compared",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/amazon-echo-and-alexa-products-comparison/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/echo2017_2-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Amazon debuted the original Echo a few years ago, and it raised eyebrows in the tech industry. The Echo is a smart home speaker that houses Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant, an AI helper that helps you complete daily tasks using only your voice. Since its debut, users of all levels of tech prowess have embraced Echo and Alexa, finding practicality in a voice-controlled assistant and all the things it can do.

Both Alexa and the Echo have evolved since then to meet the needs of an ever-growing market. After the Echo and Alexa came Google Home with the Google Assistant, the Harman Kardon Invoke with Microsoft's Cortana, and the forthcoming Homepod with Apple's Siri. Amazon has an advantage over all these competitors because it has had the time to develop many different Echo devices and expand Alexa to be a multifaceted assistant, thanks to third-party integrations and skills. (""Skills"" is Amazon's word for apps, in this case.)

Plenty of smart home device manufacturers have integrated Alexa into their products, and Alexa now has more than 25,000 skills made by third-party developers. Alexa skills are features that Alexa can leverage to do more than what its built-in features allow. For example, Alexa has native features that let it tell you weather and traffic forecasts, control smart home devices, and buy things from Amazon. Using third-party skills, Alexa can play soothing sleep sounds at night, read stories to your children, tell you random food facts, and act as the host of a trivia game for you and your friends.

Alexa has a plethora of features ready for you to use no matter which device acts as its home in your home. In the relatively short time since the debut of the original Echo, Amazon has made a number of other Echo devices in the hopes that any users can find one that fits their needs. With so many choices in Amazon's Echo family, deciding which is best for you can be hard. We've outlined the major differences and use cases for all Amazon Echo devices here to help you decide which to buy.

Echo Buttons

Amazon's Echo Buttons are the most mysterious of its devices thus far. Announced along with a slew of other Echo devices in a September event, Echo Buttons were demoed as devices that ""bring game night back."" They act like buzzers in trivia games, allowing different players to press the top button to answer questions in various Alexa-based games.

Each Button has a glowing top that can shine in different colors so each player can have their own individual color in group games. While playing a game skill through Alexa, each player can press their Button to answer a question and move the game forward. Alexa already has a bunch of game skills, but we know of three so far that will support Echo Buttons: Beat the Intro from Musicplode, Dungeon Escape, and Sounds Fun with Mike Epps from Ground Control.

The catch with Echo Buttons is that they must be connected via Bluetooth to an existing Echo device. Amazon hasn't stated which Echo devices will support the Buttons, but it's likely that most full-featured Echo devices (like the Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Show) will connect to the Buttons. The Buttons are also the first ""Alexa gadgets,"" or devices that are meant to connect to an Echo device you already have and let you interact with Alexa in new ways. Amazon claims the Echo Buttons will be available on December 19e, but we do not know about any other forthcoming Alexa gadgets yet.

Echo Connect

Amazon added voice calling and messaging with Alexa to Echo devices recently, and the Echo Connect brings that feature to landlines. The $35 box connects via your phone jack or VoIP adapter and Wi-Fi network. After completing the setup in the Alexa mobile app, you'll be able to use your voice to ask Alexa to call anyone. Your landline number will be the one that shows up on the receiver's caller ID, so there's no confusion when you're calling another landline.

However, much like the Echo Buttons, you need an existing Echo device to use the Connect. The Connect box basically acts as a bridge between your phone line and Alexa, with Amazon's voice assistant living in the Echo device you already have. When you ask Alexa to call a contact, a local business, or any other number, you're asking the voice assistant in an Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Show, or another full-featured Echo device. The Connect ensures that those calls go through your landline rather than your mobile phone.

Buy this if: you want Alexa to make calls for your landline phone.

Amazon

Echo Dot

The Echo Dot has two big advantages over other fully featured Echo devices: size and price. For just $50, the hockey-puck-sized device gives you access to most of Alexa's more than 25,000 skills and all of Amazon's built-in features for its virtual assistant. The Echo Dot can read off weather forecasts, tell you about your daily schedule, provide traffic updates, control smart home devices, read the latest news, and more. The only features it isn't compatible with are any Alexa skills that require a screen—there are some available now, but those are exclusively for the Echo Show and the forthcoming Echo Spot, the only two Amazon-made Echo devices with displays.

The design of the Echo Dot is a huge plus, and not just because of its size. Measuring 1.3×3.3×3.3 inches, it looks like Amazon sliced off the top-quarter of a regular Echo device and turned it into its own product. The Echo Dot has a 0.6-inch speaker inside to play music, but its compact size doesn't make it the best music maker. However, the device has an audio-out port for connecting to whatever other speakers and sound system you may have, and it works with Bluetooth speakers as well. That means you can connect your favorite sound device to the Echo Dot, ask Alexa to play tunes from Spotify, iHeartRadio, or other sources, and the Echo Dot will play those tracks through your favorite speaker.

The Echo Dot is the device to get if you want the voice-controlled convenience of Alexa and already have a sound system of your own in place.

Echo

The device that started it all got an update this year with the new Amazon Echo. Not only did Amazon lower the price of the Echo to $100, but the new device has an updated speaker system, improved far-field microphones for Alexa to use to hear you, and a refined design that makes it look more like a home furnishing than a piece of technology. The new Echo sounds better than the original, but it's not our favorite smart home speaker in terms of audio quality. However, if you're upgrading from a smartphone speaker or a cheap Bluetooth device, the Echo will be a solid speaker capable of filling a few rooms with sound.

The major case to be made for the Echo is that it's a decent speaker that also houses Alexa. If you purchase an Echo Dot, there's no question that you'll want to connect it to a better sound system—it's built to be more of a home for Alexa than a good speaker. On the other hand, the Echo is meant to provide both of those features at a relatively affordable price. If you're not a stickler for sound quality and just want a decent speaker with Alexa, the Echo is a solid device. You can connect the Echo to a larger speaker system as well, as it has the same audio-out port that the Echo Dot has.

Buy this if: you want the most Alexa features for a decent price.

Beth Mole,"Alcohol offers all the feels. But different drinks link to different moods, study finds.",2017-11-23T15:00:43+00:00,ars-technica,Here’s how to emotionally manipulate your family with alcohol this holiday,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/heres-how-to-emotionally-manipulate-your-family-with-alcohol-this-holiday/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/3341739412_6262fdfa57_z.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"When it comes to engineering the fickle emotions of humans, alcohol can do it all. It’s raised for successes and downed in sorrow. It can energize and relax us. It temporarily erases regrets while creating new ones. It’s liquid courage and a downer. It can smooth a first date or conjure tears alone. And this holiday—as with every holiday—it’s likely to both smother and ignite family blow-ups.

But not every drink offers the same mood maneuvering powers, according to a new study in BMJ Open. Sifting through drinking survey responses of nearly 30,000 people from 21 countries, researchers found that drinkers turn to different types of alcohol for different moods and purposes.

For instance, about 53 percent of respondents thought that red wine relaxed them, and 60 percent reported it made them sleepy. So, if you’re looking for a pacifier for any hot-headed in-laws this holiday, maybe turn to a mellow merlot. For your more enjoyable guests, go with a cocktail. Nearly 60 percent of respondents felt that spirits both energized them and boosted their confidence. And 42 percent said it made them feel sexy. But maybe keep the martinis away from that hot-headed relative—nearly 30 percent of the survey takers thought that spirits made them aggressive.

The researchers behind the study, led by Kathryn Ashton at Public Health Wales, say the data may help “better understand alcohol consumption behavior and... inform strategies and interventions to promote changes in consumption, particularly among heavier drinkers.

But, the researchers note, some of the data may be obvious to some drinkers. For instance, it might not be surprising that liquor makes some people feisty.

“For centuries, the history of rum, gin, vodka, and other spirits has been laced with violence,” co-author Mark Bellis, also of Public Health Wales, said in a statement. “This global study suggests even today consuming spirits is more likely to result in feelings of aggression than other drinks.”

For another calming option, you can go with beer. Nearly 50 percent of respondents said beer made them relaxed, and nearly 45 percent said it made them feel confident. It made 38 percent drowsy.

Of all the drinks, white wine was the most apathetic beverage. It was not strongly associated with any emotions. But only 18 percent said it made them tired.

Ashton and her colleagues took some demographic data into account, including age, gender, country of origin, and education levels. They found that women and younger drinkers were most likely to associate emotions with drinks—except for aggression. Men were more likely to associate aggression with alcohol of any kind. But the data backs up previous findings that male beer drinkers are less aggressive than male liquor drinkers.

The study has a lot of limitations. It’s an observational study based on self-reported data. There’s nothing to say that alcohol causes these emotions, just that these respondents think they do. There are confounding issues of recall bias, what activities people are doing while drinking certain drinks, whether they mix alcohols, and what moods they are in when they start drinking certain drinks.

That said, the perceptions may still be useful for crafting messages and interventions for problem drinking. For instance, the researchers notes that “alcohol already plays a large part in violence in many countries, but the concept that consumption of different alcohol products may be more likely to result in violence is rarely reflected in public health responses.”

Sam Machkovech,"Lots of good AC series content, but core experience is too low on free-to-play scale.",2017-11-23T12:00:02+00:00,ars-technica,Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp impressions: Nintendo should be ashamed,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-impressions-welp-nintendo-went-full-farmville/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot_20171121-081344-760x380.png,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"

Animal Crossing debuted as a weird, unique, and very Nintendo-like video game in 2001. It resembled popular life- and farm-sim games, where your experience in a small, riverside village revolved around simple tasks and monotony. But Nintendo added a very special pinch of time and patience.

There simply wasn't much to do in a given day after fishing, fossil scavenging, and running basic errands. That was the point. You were supposed to hop in, do your daily virtual regimen, leave notes for other players in the same household, and come back in a day or two. That formula has since shone for over a decade, with follow-up entries adding online support that essentially expands that ""cozy little household"" feeling without breaking the game's core loop.

That's why fans were understandably excited about the series getting its first smartphone entry, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, which is now out on Android and iOS. The series' mix of simple, bright graphics, cute animal friends, house decorations, and quick-hit daily tasks seems like perfect tap-and-go gaming fodder. And many of the series' best and weirdest trappings are in this smartphone version. But before addressing any of that, we have to look closely at how Nintendo converted this game from a fixed-price, retail offering to a free-to-play microtransaction disaster—and how that has rotted Animal Crossing's most rewarding elements from the inside-out.

The opposite of free-range



































Like other Animal Crossing games, Pocket Camp starts with you arriving at a new, outdoorsy locale. Instead of moving into a new town like previous games, you're asked this time to run a campground. You must attract campgoers from nearby, which you do by completing errands, picking up supplies, and crafting your neighbors' favorite furniture and decorations. Doing all of this is as simple as tapping the screen. Tap to walk. Tap to pick stuff up. Tap to talk to a pink, sweater-wearing dog. Tap to drop a fishing line in a river. Tap to catch a butterfly with a net. Anything you've done in an older AC game is easy to do by way of taps, and Nintendo designed this to work as well as you could imagine.

The first huge difference in this game, however, is that players no longer wander around a single, large town. Instead, Pocket Camp's map is broken up into smaller, discrete zones, and when you go to these, you can only do one major action. If you go near a shoreline, you'll have a fishing rod in your hand. If you head to the bug-crazy Sunburst Island, you'll only have access to a net. This disrupts the feel and flow of Animal Crossing in surprising ways. Instead of free-flowing and emergent gameplay, where you happen to see a rare bug or a fish's shadow and make moves to switch out inventory and capitalize, you're instead just heading to specific locales and farming the crap out of them until their supplies are exhausted.

When you wipe out certain supplies, particularly from fruit trees, you are promptly shown a three-hour timer. Want more cherries? You can wait a few hours for the tree to naturally produce more... orrrr you can spend your limited supply of fertilizer to make those fruits appear immediately. Want to speed up fishing? That's what new ""fishing nets"" are for, which auto-catch a slew of fish. They, too, are limited.

These kinds of supplies can be earned in the course of normal gameplay, but more of them can be purchased with the game's paid currency, called Leaf Tickets. And Nintendo makes sure you know how much stuff you can spend those Leaf Tickets on. For example, all of the region's denizens ask you to run around and fetch them certain supplies; doing this rewards you with both friendship points and experience points. When you've fulfilled a denizen's desires, you then must wait a few hours for them to come up with new requests... or you can spend a limited ""request ticket"" to make them impatient and ask for more FP- and XP-earning tasks. (Should you run out, these request tickets can be purchased with Leaf Tickets.)

Why would you be in a rush to bump these denizens' desires so quickly? Why not just go run around the island and busy yourself with other Animal Crossing-esque tasks? Because, again, you can only do certain things in each zone, and that means you can no longer do a lot of series tasks. Those include: hunting for a variety of bugs based on time of day; digging up fossils; digging, planting, and arranging flowers; designing your own clothing; hanging out at a cozy cafe; and anything relating to a museum. The series' standard museum is gone, and nothing here replaces the casual, months-long collect-a-thon it fueled.

Ticket taker















































Your campsite works more or less the same as your houses did in previous games. Place and arrange all matter of furniture, rug, plant, and other cute objects however you see fit. In order to get the region's quirky creatures to visit your campsite, you'll need to complete enough tasks to earn enough friendship points, at which time they'll demand certain furniture be placed in the campsite before they stop by. Do this, and the game will automatically (and temporarily) place whatever objects your demanding rabbit or pig friend wanted. A cut scene will play out of them sitting on all of your stuff with smiles, and then you can go back to placing furniture however you see fit.

Pocket Camp's loop works as follows: do tasks for critters to earn FP and XP, which unlocks your ability to 1) craft a greater variety of furniture and decorations and 2) meet more critters. At first, getting FP and XP is pretty easy, especially with a flood of new critter friends in the early goings. However, this process slows down remarkably, because you stop meeting new friends and instead must make older friends happier, which becomes more expensive and time-consuming. They start to want nicer, more expensive furniture items, including the larger ""amenity"" items.

I mentioned crafting up there, which is a series first. And unfortunately, it appears Nintendo instituted this whole crafting system just to dump a soup of confusing currencies into the game. You don't just collect the game's old virtual currency of ""Bells"" (which are still here and never cost real money). And you don't just accumulate those paid Leaf Tickets, which are also rewarded during standard gameplay. Now, you must also account for—ahem—paper, cotton, wood, preserves, steel, four types of ""essence,"" ""friend powder,"" and sparkle stones. And that's just after 24 hours of play.

You'll receive different amounts of each currency after completing tasks, and this becomes a blur of visual noise after a while. Like, great, I got some shinies for giving Beau the Deer some fish. I'll figure out what those mean later. But when the time comes to craft something, and you're out of, say, cotton (which has been in seriously short supply in my testing), Nintendo is quick to remind you: just spend some Leaf Tickets to make up for your missing, required supplies.

Leaf Tickets can also be spent to speed up any item-crafting timer, and every item runs on a generation timer. Early crafting items only take 1-3 minutes to generate, but already in my brief impression-period testing, I've been asked to create items that take 12 hours. For a little over $2 worth of Leaf Tickets, Nintendo can make that 12-hour wait go away (and it generates an exact Leaf Ticket price for whatever the timer is in any given circumstance). Players can also spend Leaf Tickets on more simultaneous crafting slots and more inventory slots.

It’s not just about the money

I can already see the payment wall coming right at my face. As my Pocket Camp friends become more demanding, I'll need more, harder-to-get fruits and fish (which I can speed up by using limited, sometimes-paid boost items). Then they'll demand longer-timer furniture and items, including supply-specific amenities. And the primary way to fulfill these few, basic requests is to hop from menu to menu and between very limited-instance zones, with a very basic suite of taps and menus to tap through in order to make everyone happy.

Worse, the interconnected nature of old AC games has been devastated. You can visit friends' campsites, but all you can do is look at how friends have arranged their items. There's no true interaction on their campsites. No ability to leave notes, no talking to their unique residents, and no version of ""I can get more apples or fossils from my friend's island"" here. Instead, you can put a few of your collected items up for sale, which your friends can only access in a bland menu and trade you the ""Bells"" currency for them. (It's much faster to blow limited-use items and Leaf Tickets when you're low on supplies.) You're also encouraged to tap through your friends list and demand people help you access a ""mining station"" mini-game, which takes forever to do via the friends list. This mini-game, too, is more easily accessible by spending Leaf Tickets.

The problem isn't having to pay for AC:PC's content, which isn't even required at first, thanks to a ""welcome to the game"" bounty of Leaf Tickets and other limited-supply items. If it came down to it, I wouldn't be against paying for the good parts of this game. I love the music, the world design, the quirky characters, their cheeky dialogue, and the furniture designs. I love when the tapping controls let me do standard Animal Crossing tasks like catching fish and collecting bugs. I love using my fingers to arrange various items and furniture to my liking and then watching little walking, talking animals hang out on my couches and play with my barbecue grills.

The problem is that Pocket Camp is severely tuned to push you into hurry-up-and-wait situations, as opposed to letting you freely melt into the world and be subject to the patience-is-a-virtue systems of its predecessors. Those are all gone. If you spend at least $60 on Leaf Tickets, you can accumulate every single item and placate every denizen in a few long marathon sessions, just tap-tap-tapping away between menus, currencies, and tiny zones. That goes against the spirit of the series, which might be OK if more gameplay systems were implemented to make up for this transition to mobile screens and fewer buttons. But the designers haven't added anything to the experience.

As a result, this isn't Animal Crossing. This is a scam. Nintendo should be ashamed for attaching such predatory practices to one of its most family-friendly properties, and nothing short of a full-scale redesign will fix the FarmVille-level rot within this shiny-looking game.

The cases allege substantial negligence on Uber’s part: plaintiffs say the company failed to keep safe the data of the affected 50 million customers and 7 million drivers. Uber reportedly paid $100,000 to delete the stolen data and keep news of the breach quiet.

On Tuesday, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote: “None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it.”

The first case, Alejandro Flores v. Raiser, which was filed Tuesday in federal court in Los Angeles, described Uber’s conduct as “grossly negligent” and added that the company “departed from all reasonable standards of care.” (Raiser is Uber’s subsidiary that contracts with drivers.)

Another lawsuit was submitted Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco on behalf of two people in South Carolina.

Lawyers who filed Danyelle Townsend and Ken Tew v. Uber allege that the company should have had “administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, such as intrusion detection processes that detect data breaches in a timely manner, to protect and secure Plaintiffs’ and Nationwide Class members’ [personally identifiable information].”

Further Reading Here’s a real-life, slimy example of Uber’s regulator-evading software “Major corporations like Uber face a higher threat of security breaches than smaller companies due in part to the large amounts of data they possess,” they wrote. “Uber knew or should have known its security systems were inadequate, particularly in light of the prior data breaches that Uber had experienced, and yet Uber failed to take reasonable precautions to safeguard the PII of Plaintiffs and members of the Nationwide Class.”

The law firm which brought Townsend, Keller Rohrback, has represented numerous clients in similar data breach lawsuits, including cases involving Sony, Equifax, and more.

“By choosing not to disclose this massive data breach and attempting to mitigate the breach by paying the hackers to destroy the data, Uber has essentially rolled the dice with its customers’ and drivers’ personal identities,” Cari Campen Laufenberg, a Keller Rohrback attorney said in a statement sent to Ars.

“What’s more, it has done so for more than a year–denying these victims the crucial opportunity to take timely steps to mitigate the disclosure of their private information.”

Uber did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment late Wednesday evening.","townsend keller rohrback

Sam Machkovech,Refunds for some MxM players; in-game coins for all (which won’t matter by Jan. 31).,2017-11-22T22:15:42+00:00,ars-technica,When F2P goes wrong: NCSoft gave latest game five months before pulling plug,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/when-f2p-goes-wrong-ncsoft-gave-latest-game-five-months-before-pulling-plug/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mxm.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Korean game studio NCSoft took an hours-before-Thanksgiving moment to announce bad news for fans of its most recent game, Master X Master: the free-to-play (F2P) game, which only launched five months ago, is already about to go dark.

The company's official announcement, sent to all its players on Wednesday, blamed the online game's closure on ""fail[ing] to connect with players."" (That's a short way to sum up complaints from avid users about lag, long queues between matches, and issues with monetization and content grinding.) For those players who waited until August 30 to spend real money on the game, they will receive full refunds on any MxM-related purchases within 14 days. For everyone else, the real-money store has been shut down effective immediately, with all players receiving a glut of in-game coins to purchase and unlock all the game's content before it shuts down on January 31.

MxM launched on June 21 as another entry in the MOBA genre (which you may know via games like Dota 2 and League of Legends), along with a few single-player ""PvE"" modes that range from repetitive, Diablo-like slogs to quick-and-dirty mini-games. MxM's full cast included ""all-star"" characters from NCSoft's gaming catalog, but it also confusingly launched with a bunch of brand-new characters. Otherwise, it played largely like other popular MOBA games with few differentiating factors.

The game will probably be better remembered as a crash-and-burn example of what happens when companies expect players to dump money into their microtransaction (MTX) economies. In the case of MxM fans, they can say goodbye to the game that they tried to prop up with actual cash; unless NCSoft announces future plans to open up code for private-server use, the game will be completely toast at the end of January.

As game publishers continue to experiment with payment models on retail and free-to-play titles alike, they may find users fed up with games whose MTX expire after years, let alone months.","hoursbeforethanksgiving

Peter Bright,The ability to boot DOS and other legacy relics is going to disappear.,2017-11-22T21:50:19+00:00,ars-technica,The PC BIOS will be killed off by 2020 as Intel plans move to pure UEFI,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/intel-to-kill-off-the-last-vestiges-of-the-ancient-pc-bios-by-2020/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ibm_pc_5150-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Speaking at UEFI Plugfest, a hardware interoperability testing event held by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Forum earlier this month, Intel announced that by 2020 it was going to phase out the last remaining relics of the PC BIOS by 2020, marking the full transition to UEFI firmware.

The BIOS (""Basic Input/Output System"") is a small piece of code embedded into a PC's motherboard that handles the basic initialization and booting of hardware. It's the BIOS that first probes your hardware, counts how much RAM you have installed, performs cursory checking of the hardware's health, and complains if your keyboard is unplugged; when it's finished doing its thing, it kicks off the process to actually load and run the operating system. When the operating system is running, the BIOS offers some basic system services, such as receiving keyboard input and reading and writing to the screen and the disk.

The BIOS was an essential element of IBM's first PC, the Personal Computer, in 1981. Companies wanting to build systems compatible with the PC had to build systems with a compatible BIOS, offering the same range of system services to software. If they could do this, software built for the PC would run seamlessly on their machines. Early PC clones companies each had to reverse engineered the BIOS themselves and didn't always do a great job of compatibility. But within a few years firmware company Phoenix had a reliable, accurate reverse-engineered BIOS, and it licensed it to third parties; this allowed PC clone production to proliferate.

IBM's PC BIOS was inextricably linked to the Intel x86 processors it ran on. It ran using the processor's 16-bit real mode, with the firmware itself typically written in assembler.

Over the years, the BIOS' services became less important. The use of 16-bit real mode meant that using BIOS functions was very slow, so as PC operating systems migrated in the 1990s to using the 32-bit protected mode introduced in the 386, they also started using their own 32-bit drivers to access hardware rather than the BIOS' system services. This relegated the BIOS to the initial system boot, with everything thereafter handled by the running OS.

That x86 coupling meant that other platforms, such as those built around Sun's SPARC chips and Apple/IBM/Motorola's PowerPC chips, had their own, incompatible firmwares. When Intel was developing and promoting its Itanium IA64 processors in the early 2000s, it needed a new firmware, as the x86 BIOS was obviously unsuitable. Rather than borrowing or extending one of the other non-x86 firmwares, the company developed EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) for IA64 machines.

On x86 machines, however, the BIOS lingered on well into the 2000s. Eventually, the poor performance, limited functionality, and low maintainability made Intel and the rest of the PC industry look elsewhere. EFI was extended to support 32- and 64-bit x86 systems (and others; it's also found in many ARM machines, for example), at which point it gained its current name of UEFI.

PC operating system support started to materialize around 2007 (the 64-bit x86 version of Windows Vista Service Pack 1 introduced the ability to boot from UEFI). With Intel's Sandy Bridge generation of processors, introduced in 2011, PC hardware started switching in earnest to UEFI. Nowadays, UEFI is ubiquitous, and virtually all, if not all, x86 systems ship with UEFI and not BIOS.

And while hardware companies have been a little slow off the mark, they're starting to take advantage of UEFI's easier development. Certain Surface-branded hardware from Microsoft, for example, can perform bare metal operating system recovery and installation, direct from firmware, using nothing more than an Internet connection. Such a thing really wasn't practical with a BIOS. More widely, UEFI systems can boot a lot faster than BIOS ones.

If BIOS isn't being used any more, one might wonder just what Intel is planning to do by 2020. Presently, we're in a transitional period. Although all new hardware and operating systems work natively with UEFI, the use of older operating systems—DOS, 32-bit versions of Windows older than Windows 7, 64-bit versions of Windows older than Windows Vista—is non-negligible. Moreover, certain hardware devices are also tied to the BIOS. The old BIOS had an extensibility system called Option ROMs that enabled, for example, add-in disk controllers to be recognized by and programmed with the BIOS' system services. These Option ROMs are, like the BIOS themselves, written in 16-bit real mode x86 code.

First-generation UEFI firmware was written to exclusively offer BIOS-compatible programmatic interfaces, making it seamlessly compatible with this BIOS-demanding hardware and software. Later UEFI firmware offers UEFI-native interfaces. To handle these things—old operating systems that still expect to be booted by a BIOS and old hardware that still expects to extend a BIOS—these newer firmwares can operate in a BIOS-compatible mode with a thing called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM). With the CSM, modern systems can boot old software and support old hardware. Without it, only UEFI-native hardware and software will work.

Most PCs shipping today actually ship with the CSM disabled, though they can often have it enabled as an option. By contrast, a great many standalone motherboards for self-builders ship with the CSM enabled, and, likewise, they can have it disabled as an option. A big reason for this disparity is Secure Boot and the hardware requirements that Microsoft mandates in order for a piece of hardware to be qualified for a Windows logo. Secure Boot, which protects against a wide range of malicious software that depends on tampering with the operating system on-disk, can only operate with a CSM disabled. As such, most OEM PCs ship in the Windows logo-compliant, CSM-disabled mode. Self-builders typically don't care about such things, which is why motherboards ship in the more compatible, but less secure, CSM mode.

Intel's plan is to scrap the CSM entirely. This will simplify the hardware—no need to validate it with both CSM off and on—and will mean that developers of things such as new network cards, disk controllers, and video cards no longer need to offer legacy Option ROMs just in case someone is using brand-new hardware with ancient software. It will also firmly relegate that old software to virtual machines or other ways of mimicking old environments.

Looking forward, scrapping the CSM might also enable Intel to scrap other legacy tech. Even the very latest and greatest Intel processor, such as the monster $13,011, 28-core, 56-thread Xeon Platinum 8180M, boots up acting as if it's a 16-bit 8086 chip and still has all the ancient 16-bit processor modes. Take away the BIOS and CSM requirement and it might open the door to also removing these legacy processor modes.

There have been rumors that a future Intel x86 processor would scale back some of its legacy support; a pure 32- and 64-bit processor that dropped 16-bit compatibility would fit neatly with the plans to remove the last vestiges of the BIOS from UEFI.","windows older than windows vista—is nonnegligible

ALAN FRAM and KYLE POTTER,"WASHINGTON (AP) — ""Many of you have jobs, many of you have families,"" Sen. Al Franken told Democratic leaders gathered on the eve of a hotly contested governor's election in Virginia. After an expectant pause, he leaned into the microphone and added, ""Ignore them.""

Al Franken told Democratic leaders gathered on the eve of a hotly contested governor's election in Virginia. After an expectant pause, he leaned into the microphone and added, ""Ignore them.""

Franken was jokingly beseeching activists to get out the vote the following day, in what ended up as a surprisingly decisive victory for Democratic candidate Ralph Northam. But the moment, barely two weeks ago, also underscored how high the one-time ""Saturday Night Live"" comic had risen in his party's firmament.

After spending much of his nearly nine years as senator trying to shed his funnyman image and quietly digging into issues like internet access and consumer protection, he was now a draw at political events and mentioned by some as a 2020 presidential possibility. Months of savaging some of President Donald Trump's appointees had turned the Harvard-educated Franken into a weapon of choice for Democrats eager to attack the administration and energize party voters.

Now, Franken's rising trajectory has been interrupted by allegations he had physical contact with four women without their permission. He faces a Senate ethics investigation for improper conduct and hasn't been seen publicly since the first claims of misbehavior last week. His future is suddenly unclear.

""It's always a great disappointment when leaders you like and admire do bad stuff,"" said Mike Lux, a liberal Democratic consultant. He said it was premature to say how the allegations would affect Franken's career. But, Lux added, ""If more incidents come to light, he's got a real problem.""

Los Angeles radio anchor Leeann Tweeden last week said Franken had put his tongue in her mouth during a 2006 USO tour, before he became senator. She also posted a photo of him with his hands above her chest as she slept wearing a flak vest aboard a military plane. Franken, 66, has apologized.

Another woman, Lindsay Menz, said Monday he'd squeezed her buttocks in 2010 while posing for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair. Franken, by then a senator, said he didn't remember the picture but expressed remorse that Menz felt ""disrespected.""

In a story published Wednesday by the Huffington Post, two more women alleged that Franken touched their buttocks during campaign events in 2007 and 2008.

Franken canceled a sold-out appearance in Atlanta to promote his book, ""Al Franken, Giant of the Senate."" His aides have said he's ""spending time with his family and doing a lot of reflecting.""

That time for reflection apparently yielded a Thanksgiving statement of explanation and regret — and a pledge to regain the trust of Minnesotans, suggesting that Franken wasn't planning on resigning as some have called on him to do.

In a statement provided to the Minneapolis Star Tribune and Minnesota Public Radio, Franken wrote that as a ""warm person"" he hugs people and that he's learned from recent stories that ""in some of those encounters, I crossed a line for some women — and I know that any number is too many.""

He added: ""Some women have found my greetings or embraces for a hug or photo inappropriate, and I respect their feelings about that. I've thought a lot in recent days about how that could happen, and recognize that I need to be much more careful and sensitive in these situations.

""I feel terribly that I've made some women feel badly and for that I am so sorry, and I want to make sure that never happens again. And let me say again to Minnesotans that I'm sorry for putting them through this and I'm committed to regaining their trust.""

Franken came to the Senate after a months-long recount gave him a 312-vote victory in his 2008 election. He immediately distanced himself from his decades of professional comedy, which included off-color jokes about rape and disparaging women, and avoided national reporters.

Instead, he focused on building a reputation as a studious senator, pushing legislation to crack down on Wall Street rating agencies he considered complicit in the 2007 economic collapse. As a signature issue, he adopted the push to protect ""net neutrality,"" an Obama administration policy barring internet providers from blocking or hindering websites. The Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission said Tuesday it will dismantle the rule.

Franken helped shape parts of former President Barack Obama's health care law and tackled farm and mental health issues. He easily secured a second six-year term in 2014, defeating a Republican businessman.

Franken appeared on his first Sunday network talk show late in his first term amid signs he was bolstering his national profile. But it was Trump's emergence that teased out a new Franken and had him pivot from staid senator to liberal attack dog.

In withering interrogations in the Senate, Franken has clashed with a parade of Trump Cabinet appointees.

""He made those guys sweat,"" former Senate Democratic aide Jim Manley said. ""He's got the ability to channel some of the populist rage against the administration.""

Franken had a celebrated clash last month with Jeff Sessions over the attorney general's evolving descriptions of his contacts with Russian officials during last year's presidential campaign. Sessions, a Trump campaign official, told Congress in January he'd not communicated with the Russians. He later said he didn't recall such contact. Then last month, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee he'd had no ""improper discussions"" with them.

""To me, that is moving the goal posts every time,"" Franken, a committee member, told Sessions.

At a January confirmation hearing, Franken bore into education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos when she seemed unable to answer a policy question. ""I'm not that surprised that you didn't know this issue,"" he said.

He opposed Trump Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch and battled with Rick Perry over the energy secretary's skepticism that increased carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming. He told Tom Price, who has since resigned as health secretary, that it was ""very hard to believe"" that he didn't realize he'd owned tobacco stocks, and that ""millions of Americans"" feared the Trump administration's push to repeal Obama's health care law.

In a lighter exchange, Perry told Franken he enjoyed meeting him at the senator's office, saying, ""I hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch.""

""Please, oh my Lord,"" Franken replied.

JILL COLVIN,"PALM BEACH, Fla.

(AP) — President Donald Trump thanked U.S. troops for their service on Thursday, assuring them ""we're really winning"" against America's foes as he celebrated Thanksgiving at his private club in Florida and provided lunch for Coast Guard men and women on duty for the holiday.

Using the occasion to pat himself on the back, Trump told deployed military members via a video conference that they've achieved more progress in Afghanistan and against the Islamic State group under his watch than had been made in years of the previous administration.

""Everybody's talking about the progress you've made in the last few months since I opened it up,"" he told the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division, whose members are conducting operations in Kandahar, Afghanistan. ""We're being talked about again as an armed forces — we're really winning.""

Speaking from a gilded room at his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump said: ""We're not fighting anymore to just walk around, we're fighting to win, and you people are really, you've turned it around over the last three to four months like nobody's seen, and they are talking about it, so thank you very much.""

Turning to the 74th Expeditionary Fighters Squadron based at the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, Trump suggested the Obama administration hadn't allowed soldiers on the ground to do their jobs.

""They say we've made more progress against ISIS than they did in years of the previous administration,"" he said. ""And that's because I'm letting you do your job.""

Throughout the day — at events and on Twitter — Trump boasted about the economy's performance since he took office, pointing to recent stock market gains and the unemployment rate, along with his efforts to scale back regulations and boost military spending.

""So you're fighting for something real, you're fighting for something good,"" he told the service members

Trump and his wife, Melania, also made a trip to a nearby Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach, Florida, where they delivered a lunch of turkey sandwiches, giant muffins, heaping baskets of fruit, chips and cookies to men and women on duty for the holidays.

During his remarks, Trump, singled out the service for its hurricane relief efforts during Harvey and the other storms that battered the country earlier this year.

""There's no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard,"" Trump told them ""What a job you've done.""

Trump praised the superiority of U.S. military equipment, too, yet said he tries to make sure that equipment the U.S. sells abroad — even to allies — is not quite as good as that kept at home.

""I always say, make ours a little bit better,"" Trump said. ""Keep about 10 percent in the bag."" He added: ""You never know about an ally. An ally can turn.""

Among the equipment admired by Trump is the F-35 stealth fighter jet, which he recalled asking ""Air Force guys"" about once.

""In a fight, you know a fight like I watch on the movies ... how good is it?"" he recalled asking. ""They said, 'Well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it, even if it's right next to it,'"" Trump recounted, prompting laughs.

The F-35, plagued by development problems and cost overruns, is in fact not invisible to people nearby. Its stealth technology is designed to evade detection by radar and other sensors.

At the earlier video conference, Trump cleared the room of press after about 10 minutes so he could have ""very confidential, personal conversations"" with those on the line. Borrowing a line from his ""Apprentice"" days, he told the reporters ""You're fired,"" then wished them a happy Thanksgiving, too.

On the Trumps' own Thanksgiving menu for family and friends at Mar-a-Lago: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, red snapper, Florida stone crab, baked goods, local produce and cheeses, and a selection of cakes and pies for dessert.

CALVIN WOODWARD,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Suggesting he's a victim of revenge porn from a jilted lover, Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas says he plans to go silent about the release of a nude photo of him online because police are investigating the disclosure as a possible crime against him. Authorities have not confirmed an investigation. The 68-year-old Barton, who joined the House in 1985, has acknowledged sharing intimate material with a lover and accused her of threatening to make it public when he ended the relationship. The unidentified woman told The Washington Post that she did not put it online and said the congressman sought to intimidate her by threatening to go to the authorities if she exposed his conduct.",2017-11-24T00:06:13Z,associated-press,"Barton to go mum over disclosed photo, citing probe",https://apnews.com/8888bbc0f17c4c03ad39d083646ace31,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:b3dfbfd495e74677903886ae0669c8db/3000.jpeg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Suggesting he's a victim of revenge porn from a jilted lover, Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas says he plans to go silent about the release of a nude photo of him online because police are investigating the disclosure as a possible crime against him. Authorities have not confirmed an investigation.

The 68-year-old Barton, who joined the House in 1985, has acknowledged sharing intimate material with a lover and accused her of threatening to make it public when he ended the relationship. The unidentified woman told The Washington Post that she did not put it online and said the congressman sought to intimidate her by threatening to go to the authorities if she exposed his conduct.

The he said-she said dispute erupted in the midst of sexual misconduct allegations drawing in several other members of Congress as well as Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore of Alabama, who is accused of disrobing a 14-year-old girl. The consequences for Barton are not immediately apparent aside from his mortification: The relationship with the woman was evidently consensual.

The Post published details of a secretly recorded conversation between Barton and his lover from 2015 in which he threatened to ""take all this crap to the Capitol Hill Police and have them launch an investigation"" if she did not agree to keep ""inappropriate photographs and video"" that he had exchanged with her from becoming public. He said she had already shared material with other women with whom he had been involved.

In a statement after that report, Barton said the ""Capitol Police reached out to me and offered to launch an investigation and I have accepted. Because of the pending investigation, we will have no further comment."" He said the woman's comments on the tape could be evidence of a ""potential crime against me.""

Capitol Police have not said whether they have begun an investigation. A message left by The Associated Press at Barton's district office in Arlington, Texas, was not returned. The voicemail for his office in Washington was full.

Making explicit images available without the subject's permission is a felony in the District of Columbia and a Class A misdemeanor in Texas under revenge porn laws passed several years ago. More than 30 other states have such a law; there is no corresponding federal law.

These laws have historically protected women whose boyfriends or spouses publish or publicize nude or embarrassing photos sent to them privately while they were in relationships. The jurisdiction responsible in this episode could depend on where the photos were taken or where they were put online.

In a portion of the recorded conversation, the woman asked Barton what he would tell police if he went to them.

His reply: ""I would tell them that I had a three-year undercover relationship with you over the Internet that was heavily sexual and that I had met you twice while married and had sex with you on two different occasions and that I exchanged inappropriate photographs and videos with you that I wouldn't like to be seen made public, that you still apparently had all of those and were in position to use them in a way that would negatively affect my career. That's the truth.""

Barton is the longest-serving congressman in Texas and his seat has always been considered reliably safe for Republicans.

The photo of Barton appeared on an anonymous Twitter account. It was not immediately known who posted the photo or when it was taken.

Barton issued an initial statement saying that while separated from his second wife, prior to their divorce in 2015, he had sexual relationships ""with other mature adult women."" Barton said each relationship was consensual and has since ended.

""I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down,"" Barton said.

Barton, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, announced his re-election bid this month. His district includes several counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

Barton was a consultant in the oil and gas industry before he was elected to Congress.

He is currently the vice chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. He was the committee's chairman from 2004 to 2007.

Barton has also been the longtime manager of the GOP congressional baseball team. He was taking part in a team practice in June when a gunman opened fire, injuring another congressman and others.

ERIC TUCKER,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former national security adviser Michael Flynn have told President Donald Trump's legal team that they are no longer communicating with them about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference. The decision could be a sign that Flynn is moving to cooperate with Mueller's investigation or negotiate a deal for himself. Flynn's legal team communicated the decision this week, said a person familiar with the move who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.",2017-11-24T02:35:54Z,associated-press,AP source: Flynn lawyers make a break with Trump team,https://apnews.com/275e69f075444cce91321b6886aec5c5,,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former national security adviser Michael Flynn have told President Donald Trump's legal team that they are no longer communicating with them about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference.

The decision could be a sign that Flynn is moving to cooperate with Mueller's investigation or negotiate a deal for himself. Flynn's legal team communicated the decision this week, said a person familiar with the move who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.

In large criminal investigations, defense lawyers routinely share information with each other. But it can become unethical to continue such communication if one of the potential targets is looking to negotiate a deal with prosecutors. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, didn't respond to a request for comment Thursday. A lawyer for Flynn's son, Michael Flynn Jr., who has also come under investigation from Mueller's team of prosecutors, declined to comment.

The New York Times first reported the decision.

Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser in February after White House officials concluded that he had misled them about the nature of his contacts during the transition period with the Russian ambassador to the United States.

He was interviewed by the FBI in January about his communications with the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. The deputy attorney general at the time, Sally Yates, soon advised White House officials that their public assertions that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak were incorrect and that Flynn was therefore in a compromised position.

Flynn was facing a Justice Department investigation over his foreign business dealings even before Mueller was appointed as special counsel in May to investigate potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Mueller has since inherited that investigation.

Flynn, a prominent Trump backer on the campaign trail, has been a key figure in Mueller's probe and of particular interest to Trump. Former FBI Director James Comey, for instance, said that Trump encouraged him to end an FBI investigation into Flynn during a private Oval Office meeting in February.

In addition to scrutinizing Flynn's contacts with Russia during the transition and campaign, Mueller has been investigating the retired U.S. Army lieutenant general's role in $530,000 worth of lobbying work his now-defunct firm performed for a Turkish businessman during the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign.

The lobbying campaign sought to gather derogatory information on Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric and green-card holder living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Gulen of being behind a botched coup and has sought his extradition. Gulen has denied the allegations, and U.S. officials have rebuffed Turkey's extradition demands, citing a lack of evidence.

Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, carried out the lobbying and research work for several months, meeting with officials from the U.S. and Turkish governments. Flynn also published an op-ed on Election Day in The Hill newspaper, parroting many of the Turkish government's talking points about Gulen. At the time, neither Flynn nor his company was registered with the Justice Department to represent Turkish interests.

Soon after the publication of the op-ed, the Justice Department began investigating Flynn's lobbying work, and in March, he registered with the department as a foreign agent. In federal filings, Flynn acknowledged the work could have benefited the government of Turkey.

Since then, FBI agents working for Mueller have been investigating whether the Turkish government was directing the lobbying work and not a private company owned by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin, as Flynn's firm has contended. FBI agents have also been asking about Flynn's business partner, Bijan Kian, who served on Trump's presidential transition, and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., who worked for his father as part of the lobbying campaign. Flynn Jr. also was a near constant presence around his father during the Trump campaign and presidential transition period.

Mueller announced his first charges in the investigation last month, including the guilty plea of a foreign-policy adviser to the campaign, George Papadopoulos, and the indictments of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates.

ANDREW MELDRUM,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Zimbabwe's incoming leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, widely known as the Crocodile, is seen as a smart, ruthless politician, and many question if he will be able to bring the change the country craves.

""We are witnessing the beginning of a new, unfolding democracy,"" the 75-year-old announced Wednesday upon his return to the country, two weeks after his firing by longtime mentor Robert Mugabe led to the president's downfall.

Despite the message of inclusion, Zimbabweans noted that Mnangagwa made his first public remarks outside ruling ZANU-PF party headquarters and, switching to the local Shona language, praised the party.

They ask whether Mnangagwa will be adequately independent from ZANU-PF to revive the battered economy and restore democracy with the backing of the opposition and others.

The ruling party has proven it protects its own. It assured Mugabe he would not be prosecuted if he stepped down, ZANU-PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke told The Associated Press: ""He is safe, his family is safe and his status as a hero of his country is assured.""

Mnangagwa's remarkable rise to power — from being sacked as vice president and fleeing the country to being named Zimbabwe's next leader — was largely thanks to the military, which put Mugabe under house arrest, and ruling party lawmakers who introduced the impeachment proceedings.

It is widely expected that Mnangagwa will continue to rely on them.

""Can a crocodile change its scales? Everybody is asking that question. Certainly his first speech was a lost opportunity. He did not speak about the need for an inclusive government,"" said Piers Pigou, southern Africa expert for the International Crisis Group. ""He has a long past with ZANU-PF and the military and that past may stick to him like chewing gum on a shoe.""

Pigou said more will be known when Mnangagwa announces his new government and policies. ""It will be difficult for him to escape his history,"" he said. ""But the door is open.""

Mnangagwa served for decades as Mugabe's enforcer and among Zimbabwe's population, he is more feared than popular. He now urges the country to come together, to ""bury our differences and rebuild a new and prosperous Zimbabwe, a country that is tolerant to divergent views.""

For weeks before the political turmoil erupted, Mnangagwa had been publicly demonized by Mugabe and his wife, Grace, who was seeking to succeed her 93-year-old husband in power.

That gave Mnangagwa time to prepare his strategy. Within days of his firing, his supporters in the military put Mugabe and his wife under house arrest.

When Mugabe refused to resign, a massive demonstration backed by the military brought tens of thousands of people into the streets of the capital, Harare. It was not a spontaneous uprising. Thousands of professionally produced posters praising Mnangagwa and the military had been printed ahead of time.

Mnangagwa's links to the military and ruling party go back decades. He joined the fight against white minority rule in what was then Rhodesia while still a teen in the 1960s. In 1963, he received military training in Egypt and China. As one of the earliest guerrilla fighters he was captured, tortured and convicted of blowing up a locomotive in 1965.

Sentenced to death by hanging, he was found to be under 21 and his punishment was commuted to 10 years in prison. He was jailed with other prominent nationalists including Mugabe.

While imprisoned, Mnangagwa studied through correspondence courses. After his release in 1975 he went to Zambia, where he completed a law degree and started practicing. Soon he went to newly independent Marxist Mozambique, where he became Mugabe's assistant and bodyguard. In 1979, he accompanied Mugabe to the talks in London that led to the birth of Zimbabwe.

""Our relationship has over the years blossomed beyond that of master and servant to father and son,"" Mnangagwa wrote this month of his relationship with Mugabe.

When Zimbabwe achieved independence in 1980, Mnangagwa was appointed minister of security. He directed the merger of the Rhodesian army with Mugabe's guerrilla forces and the forces of rival nationalist leader Joshua Nkomo.

In 1983, Mugabe launched a brutal campaign against Nkomo's supporters that became known as the Matabeleland massacres for the deaths of 10,000 to 20,000 Ndebele people in Zimbabwe's southern provinces. Mnangagwa was widely blamed for planning the deadly campaign of the army's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade. Mnangagwa denies it.

He also is reputed to have amassed a considerable fortune. He was named in a United Nations investigation into exploitation of mineral resources in Congo and has been active in making Harare a significant diamond trading center.

In 2008, Mnangagwa was Mugabe's agent in an election marked by violence and allegations of vote-rigging, leading him to be placed under U.S. sanctions that continue to this day. He also helped broker the creation of a short-lived coalition government that brought in opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister.

Mnangagwa has updated his image. Two years ago he had a short afro of grey hair, now his hair is black and trimmed very short.

In recent years, Mnangagwa has promoted himself as an experienced leader who would bring stability to Zimbabwe.

Despite his bloody past, ""some people see redeeming features in Mnangagwa,"" said Tichaona Zindoga, political editor of the state-run Herald newspaper. ""He is seen as business-oriented, which may help him improve the economy.""

However, Zindoga added, ""politically his ties to ZANU-PF cannot be wished away. And the events of the past two weeks mean that he is ingratiated to the military.""","armys north koreantrained fifth brigade mnangagwa

ALMUDENA CALATRAVA and LUIS ANDRES HENAO,"MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina (AP) — An apparent explosion occurred near the time and place an Argentine submarine went missing, the country's navy reported Thursday, prompting relatives of the vessel's 44 crew members to burst into tears and some to say they had lost hope of a rescue.

Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said the search will continue until there is full certainty about the fate of the ARA San Juan, despite the evidence of an explosion and with more than a week having passed since the submarine disappeared. It was originally scheduled to arrive Monday at Argentina's Mar del Plata Navy Base.

The U.S. Navy and an international nuclear test-ban monitoring organization said a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" was produced just hours after the navy lost contact with the sub on Nov. 15. It was near the submarine's last known location.

""According to this report, there was an explosion,"" Balbi told reporters. ""We don't know what caused an explosion of these characteristics at this site on this date.""

The navy spokesman described the ""anomaly"" as ""singular, short, violent and non-nuclear.""

Relatives of the crew who had gathered at the Mar del Plata base to receive psychological counseling broke into tears and hugged each other after they received the news. Some fell on their knees or clung to a fence crowded with blue-and-white Argentine flags, rosary beads and messages of support. Most declined to speak, while a few others lashed out in anger at the navy's response.

""They sent a piece of crap to sail,"" said Itati Leguizamon, wife of submarine crew member German Suarez. ""They inaugurated a submarine with a coat of paint and a flag in 2014, but without any equipment inside. The navy is to blame for its 15 years of abandonment.""

Balbi defended the Argentine Navy, saying that ""with respect to the maintenance and state of our naval and air units, no unit ever leaves port or takes off if it isn't in operating conditions to navigate or fly with total security.""

The German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in 1985 and was most recently refitted in 2014.

During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts say that refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers and even the smallest mistake during the cutting phase of the operation can put the safety of the ship and the crew at risk.

The Argentine navy and outside experts have said that even if the ARA San Juan is intact, its crew might have only enough oxygen to be submerged seven to 10 days. It lost contact as it was sailing from the extreme southern port of Ushuaia. The submarine's captain had reported a battery failure.

Authorities said late Wednesday that Argentine navy ships as well a U.S. P-8 Poseidon aircraft and a Brazilian air force plane would return to the area to check out the abnormal sound, which originated about 30 miles north of the submarine's last registered position.

The search location straddles the edge of the continental shelf, with widely varying ocean depths, some as great as 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Experts say the submarine could not have supported pressures that far down.

""If a submarine goes below its crush-depth, it would implode, it would just collapse,"" said James H. Patton Jr. a retired Navy captain. ""It would sound like a very, very big explosion to any listening device.""

Whatever it was, U.S. Navy Lt. Lily Hinz said the sound detected ""was not a whale, and it is not a regularly occurring sound.""

Claudio Rodriguez, brother of crew member Hernan Rodriguez, said his family suspects ""the explosion was so strong that they were not able to rise to the surface or shoot any flares. They didn't have time for anything.""

""As a family, we're grateful to all the people who prayed for us and for the families of all the 44,"" he said.

More than a dozen airplanes and ships have been participating in the multinational search despite stormy weather that has caused waves of more than 20 feet (6 meters). Search teams are combing an area of some 185,000 square miles (480,000 square kilometers), which is roughly the size of Spain.

The U.S. government has sent two P-8 Poseidons, a naval research ship, a submarine rescue chamber and sonar-equipped underwater vehicles. U.S. Navy sailors from the San Diego-based Undersea Rescue Command were also helping with the search.

Britain's Ministry of Defense sent a special airplane with emergency life support pods to join the hunt that includes planes and ships from a dozen nations.

Hopes were buoyed after brief satellite calls were received and when sounds were detected deep in the South Atlantic. But experts later determined that neither was from the missing sub.

""They haven't come back and they will never come back,"" said Jesica Gopar, wife of submarine officer Fernando Santilli, choking back tears. ""I had a bad feeling about this and now it has been confirmed.""

WILLIAM MATHIS,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade featured balloons, bands, stars and heavy security in a year marked by attacks on outdoor gathering spots. With new faces and old favorites in the lineup, the Americana extravaganza made its way through 2 ½ miles (3.22 kilometers) of Manhattan on a cold morning. ""The crowds are still the same, but there's a lot more police here. That's the age we live in,"" Paul Seyforth said as he attended the parade he'd watched since the 1950s.",2017-11-23T21:40:24Z,associated-press,Macy's Thanksgiving parade revels on amid tight security,https://apnews.com/1f1a0f3b997d4fbfbfb981a0d5a821bc,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:ab02090857b84a74a68c912d3936a9eb/3000.jpeg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade featured balloons, bands, stars and heavy security in a year marked by attacks on outdoor gathering spots.

With new faces and old favorites in the lineup, the Americana extravaganza made its way through 2 ½ miles (3.22 kilometers) of Manhattan on a cold morning.

""The crowds are still the same, but there's a lot more police here. That's the age we live in,"" Paul Seyforth said as he attended the parade he'd watched since the 1950s.

""Not a lot's changed — the balloons, the bands, the floats — and that's the good thing,"" said Seyforth, 76, who'd flown in from Denver to spend his 50th wedding anniversary in New York and see this year's parade.

The televised parade was proceeding smoothly, though about midway through, a gust of wind on a largely calm day blew a candy-cane balloon into a tree branch, and it popped near the start of the route on Manhattan's Upper West Side. No one was injured.

In 2005, one of the parade's signature giant balloons caught a gust, hit a Times Square lamppost and injured two people. The candy cane was smaller than the giant balloons.

Timothy McMillian and his wife, their 9-year-old daughter and his in-laws started staking out a spot along the route at 6:30 a.m. They'd come from Greensboro, North Carolina, to see in person the spectacle they'd watched on TV for years.

McMillian, a 45-year-old schoolteacher, booked a hotel months ago, but he started to have some concerns about security when a truck attack on a bike path near the World Trade Center killed eight people on Halloween.

""With the event being out in the open like this, we were concerned,"" he said. ""But we knew security would be ramped up today, and we have full confidence in the NYPD.""

Authorities say there is no confirmation of a credible threat to the parade, but they were taking no chances after both the truck attack and the October shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival.

Four activists jumped over barriers and briefly sat down in the street at about 9:10 a.m. to protest the end of a program that extended protections to immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children, according to a spokesman for activist group Cosecha. Police quickly escorted them back. No one was arrested and the parade was not delayed.

New York Police Department officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors were circulating among the crowds, sharpshooters were on rooftops and sand-filled city sanitation trucks were poised as imposing barriers to traffic at every cross street. Officers also were escorting each of the giant balloons.

The mayor and police brass have repeatedly stressed that visitors shouldn't be deterred. And Bekki Grinnell certainly wasn't.

""When your kid from Alaska is marching in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, you come,"" said Grinnell, whose daughter was marching with the band from Colony High School in Palmer, Alaska. Grinnell said she wasn't worried about security because of the police presence: ""I think we're in a safe spot.""

Other paradegoers also showed their appreciation for police: The NYPD marching band and a group of mounted officers got some of the biggest cheers from spectators lined up as many as 15 deep along barricades. Among other crowd favorites: as did the SpongeBob SquarePants balloon.

The 91st annual parade featured new balloons including Olaf from the Disney movie ""Frozen"" and Chase from the TV cartoon ""Paw Patrol"" will be among the new balloons Thursday, along with a new version of the Grinch of Dr. Seuss fame.

Smokey Robinson, The Roots, Flo Rida and Wyclef Jean were among the stars celebrating, along with performances from the casts of Broadway's ""Anastasia,"" ''Dear Evan Hansen"" and ""SpongeBob SquarePants."" The lineup included a dozen marching bands, as well as the high-kicking Radio City Music Hall Rockettes — and, of course, Santa Claus.

""This is my favorite thing ever,"" musician Questlove told The Associated Press as he got ready to ride the Gibson Guitars float with his bandmates in The Roots and late-night host Jimmy Fallon of ""The Tonight Show,"" where The Roots are the house band. Questlove said being in the parade is ""probably my favorite perk"" of the job.

""To go from being a spectator to being up here, it's kinda cool,"" he said.

Added singer-songwriter Andy Grammer as he got on the Homewood Suites float: ""It's kind of like being at the center of Thanksgiving.""

ROD McGUIRK,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Papua New Guinea authorities said Friday they had relocated the last asylum seekers who had refused for three weeks to leave a closed immigration camp for fear they would face violence in the alternative accommodations. Police Chief Superintendent Dominic Kakas said police and immigration officials removed all 378 men from the male-only camp on Manus Island over two days and took them by bus to residences in the nearby town of Lorengau. ""Everybody's gone. Everybody got on the buses, they packed their bags and they moved over,"" Kakas said.",2017-11-24T02:57:00Z,associated-press,Papua New Guinea officials remove last refugees from camp,https://apnews.com/3da3655ea718419a86d6513dd6f1d9f3,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:ab120cebb38d4315850336aa0ac8b839/3000.jpeg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Papua New Guinea authorities said Friday they had relocated the last asylum seekers who had refused for three weeks to leave a closed immigration camp for fear they would face violence in the alternative accommodations.

Police Chief Superintendent Dominic Kakas said police and immigration officials removed all 378 men from the male-only camp on Manus Island over two days and took them by bus to residences in the nearby town of Lorengau.

""Everybody's gone. Everybody got on the buses, they packed their bags and they moved over,"" Kakas said.

Refugee advocates say officials used force and destroyed asylum seekers' belongings to make them leave Manus.

Video was released of officials in the camp wielding what appeared to be wooden sticks.

Water, power and food supplies ended when the Manus camp ended officially closed on Oct. 31, based on the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court's ruling last year that Australia's policy of housing asylum seekers there was unconstitutional. But asylum seekers fear for their safety in Lorengau because of threats from local residents.

Australia pays Papua New Guinea, its nearest neighbor, and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru to hold thousands of asylum seekers from Africa, the Middle East and Asia who have attempted to reach Australian shores by boat since mid-2013.

Before confirmation that Manus Island had been emptied, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed news that asylum seekers were leaving.

""I'm please to say in terms of Manus, that the reports we have are that busloads of the people at Manus are leaving, they're complying with the lawful directions of the PNG authorities and moving to the alternative facilities available to them and that's as they should,"" Turnbull told reporters.

""That is precisely what you should do, if you're in a foreign country. You should comply with the laws of that other country,"" he added.

Shen Narayanasamy, activist group GetUp's rights campaigner said in a statement: ""I awoke this morning to frantic phone calls from refugees on Manus screaming: 'Help, help, they are killing us.' It is astounding that refugees being beaten and dragged out to buses has the support of the Australian government.""

Police maintain no force was used.

Australian Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton accused refugee advocates of making ""inaccurate and exaggerated claims of violence and injuries on Manus,"" without providing evidence.

Dutton also accused asylum seekers of sabotaging backup generators and water infrastructure at the new accommodation provided by Australia in Lorengau.

""What is clear is that there has been an organized attempt to provoke trouble and disrupt the new facilities,"" Dutton said in a statement.

Australia will not settle any refugees who try to arrive by boat — a policy that the government says dissuades them from attempting the dangerous ocean crossing from Indonesia. The navy has also been turning back boats to keep them from reaching Australia since July 2014.

The United States has agreed to resettle up to 1,250 of the refugees under a deal struck by former President Barack Obama's administration that President Donald Trump has reluctantly decided to honor. So far, only 54 have been accepted by the United States.","pacific nation of nauru

ANNE D'INNOCENZIO,"NEW YORK (AP) — Shoppers are hitting the stores on Thanksgiving as retailers under pressure look for ways to poach shoppers from their rivals. As the holiday shopping season officially kicked off, retailers are counting on a lift from a better economy. But they're also looking beyond economic data and mapping out ways to pick up sales from other retailers as Amazon expands its reach.

Penney, Barbies at Best Buy, kitchen appliances like wine refrigerators at B.J.'s.",2017-11-24T01:28:33Z,associated-press,"Shoppers mobilize on Thanksgiving, as retailers branch out",https://apnews.com/ad27b28393e74ad4ab2a674485a2822a,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:a8a08d454184465c932b0710efa2ac06/3000.jpeg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"NEW YORK (AP) — Shoppers are hitting the stores on Thanksgiving as retailers under pressure look for ways to poach shoppers from their rivals.

As the holiday shopping season officially kicked off, retailers are counting on a lift from a better economy. But they're also looking beyond economic data and mapping out ways to pick up sales from other retailers as Amazon expands its reach.

That can mean opening earlier than rivals on the holidays or even jumping into new product categories. So shoppers may find some surprises: toys and TVs at J.C. Penney, Barbies at Best Buy, kitchen appliances like wine refrigerators at B.J.'s.

At Macy's Herald Square in Manhattan, it was the deals like cosmetic and perfume sets from $10 to $20 as well as 40 percent off on boots and shoes that drew attention. Its Apple shop was packed too, with deals on gadgets like the Apple Watch.

Tiffany Lloyd, in town from Columbia, Maryland, was visiting tourist sites when she realized stores were open.

""This is not a traditional Thanksgiving. We ate pizza,"" said Lloyd, who was buying a pair of Naturalizer shoes at 40 percent off and said she planned to buy three more pairs. She said she also picked up sweaters on sale at Old Navy.

Despite the early crowds at stores, analysts at Bain say Amazon is expected to take half of the holiday season's sales growth. And Amazon is the top destination for people to begin holiday shopping, according to a September study by market research firm NPD Group.

""The retailers are in survival mode. It's about stealing each other's market share,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD. ""Amazon is the Grinch. They're stealing the growth.""

Abi and Sush Gyawali — both 27-year-old biology graduate students at the University of Missouri — were among hundreds of people who lined up outside J.C. Penney in Columbia, Missouri, before the store opened at 2 p.m. Thursday. Abi Gyawali normally shops online on Amazon or Best Buy for Cyber Monday, where he said he finds some of the best deals.

But he said the couple wanted to check out the scene at the mall before friends came over to share a meal. He and his wife planned to just collect coupons that were being handed out, but ended up getting a discounted air fryer.

With the jobless rate at a 17-year-low of 4.1 percent and consumer confidence stronger than a year ago, analysts project healthy sales increases for November and December. The National Retail Federation trade group expects sales for that period to at least match last year's rise of 3.6 percent and estimates online spending and other non-store sales will rise 11 to 15 percent.

Amazon is expected to be a big beneficiary as it cements loyalty among its Prime members and moves into new services and private-label merchandise. That leaves stores looking at rivals to see where they can pick up sales. There are extra dollars up for grabs this year, after thousands of store locations have closed and several retailers filed for bankruptcy protection.

Target CEO Brian Cornell recently noted that up to $60 billion in consumer spending will be up for the taking in the next few years, and said the chain has been picking up market share in such areas as clothing.

Greg Foran, CEO of Walmart's U.S. division, said that the retail giant's holiday shopping season appeared to be off to a good start. It got things going in the first minutes of Thursday with an online sales event that featured a range of deals from toys to TVs to slow cookers and Google Home mini gadgets.

""We have a bit of momentum and we had a good kickoff online,"" Foran told The Associated Press, ""and with a bit of luck we are going to have a good 24 hours and be ship-shape for the weekend, and go from here to the 25th of December.""

The Thanksgiving weekend, when stores go all-out to attract shoppers, can be an indication of how well they'll do through the season. About 69 percent of Americans, or 164 million people, intend to shop at some point during the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, according to a survey released by the National Retail Federation. It expects Black Friday to remain the busiest day, with about 115 million people planning to shop then.

Judy St. Antoine, 60, of St. Petersburg, Florida, said she arrived at the J.C. Penney in her city about 10 minutes before the store's 2 p.m. opening. There were already two lines of a couple hundred people each waiting. St. Antoine said she came ""for the sale,"" and that she'll finish up her Thanksgiving afterward.

Mary Bergeron, 62, of Tampa, bought an oil-less fryer, a waffle maker and a steamer at JC Penney, and was headed back for more.

""It's a tradition. We come here every year,"" she said, adding that she'd eaten turkey at noon. ""It's crazy, there are so many people and it gets tense. It's fun.""

Some retailers are using the weekend to test new product areas: Penney has TVs and consumer electronics like game consoles as doorbusters for Thanksgiving and Black Friday only, one example of what Penney's Senior Vice President James Starke called ""market share plays.""

Chris Baldwin, CEO of BJ's Wholesale Club, says it is offering more toys and clothes, including key national brands in areas like casual athletic wear.

""There's no question that consumer spending has started to tick up and confidence is a little bit better, which is terrific, but we are also seeing some benefit from other retailers,"" he said.

Mike Freeman,DETROIT — The  Minnesota Vikings  have what you would call a gorgeous predicament.    On the bench is a bright young talent named Teddy  Bridgewater . You may have heard of him...,2017-11-23T23:09:35Z,bleacher-report,"Case Keenum Has Answered Vikings' QB Question, so What Comes Next?",http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2745781-case-keenum-has-answered-vikings-qb-question-so-what-comes-next,https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/709/478/hi-res-9a67027544317b604d515da468405823_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Hannah Foslien/Getty Images

DETROIT — The Minnesota Vikings have what you would call a gorgeous predicament.

On the bench is a bright young talent named Teddy Bridgewater. You may have heard of him. He's the future of this franchise at quarterback. Probably. Without question. Right?

On the field is Case Keenum, who has been a journeyman for much of his career. A scout for one of the teams Keenum played for joked to me he used to call Keenum ""Case the Face"" because Keenum's bad throws always caused the scout to make pained expressions.

The Vikings have good options at quarterback. That's the nice part. The predicament? What do they do moving forward?

Keenum is playing as well as almost any quarterback in football. He's making throws into windows so tight, the waft of turkey and stuffing couldn't get through them, but his footballs do. And while making all of those nice passes, Keenum is also observing the cardinal quarterback rule: Do no harm.

Against the Lions, he didn't throw an interception. No matter what happens from here, Keenum has carved out a nice future for himself. More on that in a moment.

Minnesota's 30-23 win over Detroit did more than just cement the Vikings as a legitimate Super Bowl threat or push the Lions out of NFC North title contention—it also showed just how stupid it would be to replace Keenum now with Bridgewater.

Gregory Shamus/Getty Images

Making that move would be one of the more foolish things a team has done in a long time. Bridgewater is a good man and player (and good story), but none of that should matter now.

The Vikings have won seven consecutive games. They are 9-2, the best start for the team since 2009. They lead the NFC North by three games over the 6-5 Lions with five games to play. They are smart, vicious and have rallied around Keenum. Don't mess with good chemistry.

Minnesota will win the NFC North, and while a playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles or New Orleans Saints would require Keenum to leave his comfort zone and grow even more than he has, the Vikings are formidable because he fits so neatly into what the team does: Play hardcore defense, run the ball and don't make a lot of mistakes.

Keenum is also making everyone around him better. It's no coincidence that wide receiver Adam Thielen is having a career year with Keenum at quarterback. Thielen and Randy Moss are the only two Vikings in team history to have at least 70 catches and 1,000 receiving yards in the team's first 11 games, per Randall Liu, the NFL's senior director of football communications.

""He's fearless and he's made the most of his opportunity,"" said Thielen of Keenum.

Then there was this blunt assessment from a Vikings player to me, echoing something Mike Zimmer told reporters several days ago. The player compared Keenum's, um, jewels to King Kong's.

Alrighty then.

That is a theme when you talk to Vikings players and coaches. They think Keenum is fearless.

You saw some of those guts on one particular play as the Lions came within four points in the fourth quarter. It was a seven-yard completion to receiver Stefon Diggs as Keenum was hit by cornerback Darius Slay, but the throw was perfect. Keenum finished the game 21-of-30 for 282 yards and three total touchdowns.

Keenum's passer rating was 121.8, his fifth game this season with a rating of at least 100 and his third straight, per Vikings PR.

No, you cannot bench him. Not yet.

This brings us back to the team's gorgeous predicament or, at least, another aspect of it. Do the Vikings bring Keenum back next season or let him go and trust Bridgewater?

Alex Brandon/Associated Press

One of the key components when trying to answer that is Zimmer himself. He's proved to be a sort of low-key quarterback whisperer. Before Sam Bradford was injured, Zimmer had Bradford playing well. That couldn't be said before in Bradford's career. When Keenum played with the Rams, under the offensive genius of Jeff Fisher (sarcasm alert), Keenum wasn't good. Now, under Zimmer, he is.

That's not happenstance.

If Keenum were to leave, would he receive the same type of high-caliber coaching he's getting now? Would he be the same fearless quarterback? Or would he revert to the old Keenum?

If he does leave, however, he'd be one of the top free agents on the market in a league desperate for solid quarterback play.

Meanwhile, this Vikings team is for real.

""We're not playing to get in the tournament,"" Zimmer told his team after the game. ""We're playing to f--king win at home.""

As in the Super Bowl is in Minneapolis this year.

With Keenum, they have a legitimate shot. Why not them? Why not now?","jeff fisher sarcasm alert keenum

The Dallas Cowboys remain winless since Ezekiel Elliott began serving his six-game suspension after falling 28-6 at home to the Los Angeles Chargers on Thanksgiving Day at AT&T Stadium.

Dallas' offensive struggles without Elliott in the backfield continued Thursday. The Cowboys gained 458 yards and scored 16 points combined in their previous two games, and they reached just 247 total yards against the Chargers.

Dak Prescott was 20-of-27 for 179 yards and two interceptions.

Former Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo was in the booth analyzing the game for CBS. ESPN The Magazine's Mina Kimes thought that made for an interesting dynamic as he broke down Prescott's poor day:

Prescott is an easy scapegoat, but the Cowboys defense was equally culpable for the lopsided loss. Dallas allowed 515 total yards, and Los Angeles averaged 7.8 yards per play.

Philip Rivers had a season-high 434 yards and three touchdowns on 27-of-33 passing.

That's not to say everything was smooth sailing for the Chargers offense.

Nick Novak missed a 35-yard field goal in the first quarter, and the team subsequently announced Novak was dealing with a back injury during the game, which left punter Drew Kaser as the emergency replacement.

Head coach Anthony Lynn's lack of faith in Kaser was evident when he decided to go for it on a 4th-and-13 at the Cowboys' 16-yard line rather than try a field goal with 13 minutes, 36 seconds remaining in the first half.

Perhaps Lynn watched Kaser miss the practice net entirely when he was warming up on the sideline:

The Chargers reached the red zone on each of their first three possessions but came away with only three points in the first half. Novak connected on a 22-yard field goal at the 1:56 mark of the second quarter.

NFL Network's Rich Eisen thought the first half encapsulated Los Angeles' season:

Of course, the Chargers' problems paled in comparison to those of the Cowboys. Dallas went scoreless and gained 84 yards through the first two quarters. David Helman of the team's official website was surprised by the unit's ineffectiveness:

Elliott's absence was a big reason the Cowboys couldn't move the ball, and Dez Bryant's disappearance compounded matters. Bryant didn't have a single target in the first half for the first time since 2013, according to NFL Research:

Bryant finished with three receptions for 37 yards on five targets.

The Cowboys' struggles didn't let up in the second half, which allowed the Chargers to bust the game open with a pair of touchdown passes from Rivers in the third quarter.

Rivers hit Hunter Henry from three yards out with 8:59 left in the quarter. Novak missed the extra-point attempt, so the Chargers settled for a 9-0 lead before Rivers found Tyrell Williams for a 27-yard touchdown. Kaser's extra point was good, so Los Angeles took a 16-0 advantage into the fourth quarter.

Rod Smith got the Cowboys on the board with a two-yard touchdown run at the 12:48 mark of the fourth quarter. Dallas went for two and failed, which didn't matter much after Keenan Allen canceled out Smith's touchdown with one of his own a little less than three minutes later.

The NFL shared a replay of the touchdown:

Chargers cornerback Desmond King shut the door on the Cowboys' comeback attempt when he intercepted a Prescott pass and returned it 90 yards for a score with 7:41 left in the game.

That the Cowboys offense failed to consistently move the ball is a major concern for Dallas, since Elliott is out for another three games. At 5-6, the Cowboys are 1.5 games behind the Atlanta Falcons for the final wild-card spot in the NFC, and the gap may grow in the coming weeks.

The schedule is somewhat favorable for Dallas, though. The Washington Redskins, New York Giants and Oakland Raiders rank 19th, 28th and 32nd in defensive efficiency, according to Football Outsiders. Playing the Giants and Raiders in particular could help awaken the dormant Cowboys offense.

Since nine or 10 wins may be the requirement to reach the playoffs in the NFC, Dallas has little margin for error the rest of the season.

The Chargers, on the other hand, are trending upward after notching their fifth win in seven games. They also have a great opportunity to move to .500 in Week 13 with the Cleveland Browns awaiting them Dec. 3.

Only one of Los Angeles' five remaining opponents has a winning record, so the Chargers shouldn't be dismissed as an afterthought in the AFC playoff race.","washington redskins new york giants

Mississippi State Bulldogs quarterback Nick Fitzgerald suffered a leg injury in the first quarter of Thursday's game against the Ole Miss Rebels, Fox Sports' Bruce Feldman reported.

Trainers placed an air cast on Fitzgerald's right leg and carted him back to the locker room. Fitzgerald received an ovation from both teams and the fans inside Davis Wade Stadium in Starkville, as SEC Network shared:

Before exiting, the junior passer was 1-of-5 for 12 yards with an interception. During the second quarter of the game, Fitzgerald sent out a tweet:

After the game, Mississippi State head coach Dan Mullen told reporters Fitzgerald had suffered a dislocated ankle, but he didn't have more information than that.

Fitzgerald's father said the quarterback's injury had a six-to-eight week recovery time and that he will be ready for spring practice, per Will Sammon of the Clarion-Ledger.

Fitzgerald's injury will almost certainly rule him out for Mississippi State's bowl game, and the big question is whether his preparations for the 2018 season will be impacted.

Freshman quarterback Keytaon Thompson replaced Fitzgerald against Ole Miss and showed off his athleticism by breaking free for a 32-yard run.

Thompson entered Thursday having thrown for 66 yards and a touchdown in mop-up duty for Fitzgerald throughout the season.

The New Orleans native was the No. 5 dual-threat quarterback in the 2017 recruiting class, according to 247Sports' composite rankings. The fact Thompson will see meaningful action as a true freshman supplies Mississippi State with a silver lining from what is otherwise a major blow to the offense.","clarionledger fitzgeralds

Case Keenum and the Minnesota Vikings will enjoy a commanding NFC North lead during their Thanksgiving dinner following Thursday's 30-23 victory over the Detroit Lions at Ford Field.

Minnesota extended its winning streak to seven and is 9-2 overall, well ahead of the 6-5 Lions with only five games remaining in the season. Detroit's three-game winning streak came to an end Thursday, but it is still in the middle of the NFC wild-card race.

Detroit was threatening to become the first team in league history to overcome a 17-point deficit on Thanksgiving, per the Fox broadcast, when it trimmed a 27-10 deficit to just 27-23 in the fourth quarter. However, a Xavier Rhodes interception with less than three minutes remaining and Detroit's jumping offside that nullified a blocked Kai Forbath field goal clinched the win for the Vikings.

The pick halted a potential game-tying drive and what was a dramatic comeback effort from Matthew Stafford and the Lions.

Two field goals put them within striking distance before Marvin Jones Jr. turned heads with a terrific catch in double coverage for a 43-yard touchdown on a play that saw Stafford limp off after his ankle was rolled up on.

He remained in the contest, finishing with 250 passing yards and two touchdowns, both of which went to Jones. The explosive receiver tallied six catches for 109 yards and the two scores, but a Minnesota defense that entered Thursday fourth in the league in points allowed per game came through with the contest hanging in the balance after Keenum laid the groundwork.

Keenum, like Stafford, threw both of his touchdowns to the same receiver. Tight end Kyle Rudolph was the beneficiary, with his first score capping a 14-play, 80-yard drive on Minnesota's first possession and the second one going for 22 yards and opening a three-score lead in the first half.

Keenum completed 21 of his 30 pass attempts for 282 yards and also added a rushing touchdown on a read-option keeper on the Vikings' second possession.

As a result, Fox deemed him the player of the game and awarded him with a silver-encrusted football in the postgame.

Ian Rapoport of NFL.com reflected on Keenum's turnaround this season for the red-hot Vikings:

It wasn't just the Keenum and Rudolph (four catches for 63 yards) show, as talented pass-catchers Adam Thielen (eight catches for 89 yards) and Stefon Diggs (five catches for 66 yards) helped establish Minnesota's early lead.

Were it not for Stafford finding Jones for a touchdown in the final minute of the first half and a blocked Forbath field goal and extra point, Keenum likely would have put the Lions away by halftime.

He also received a boost from the rushing attack, as Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon combined for four carries and 75 yards on the first drive of the second half with Murray finding the end zone. It was Minnesota's last touchdown of the contest and provided the winning margin after Detroit's failed comeback attempt.

Murray finished with 84 yards and the touchdown on 20 carries, while McKinnon featured in the aerial attack with a 31-yard reception and 13 carries for 23 yards.

Minnesota will now take its winning streak and turn its attention toward a potential playoff preview against the Atlanta Falcons, while the Lions will face an AFC playoff contender in the Baltimore Ravens.","ford field minnesota

Hong/Associated Press

President Donald Trump reportedly provided a whirlwind of free advertising for LaVar Ball in their back-and-forth feud.

On Thursday, Darren Rovell of ESPN cited Apex Marketing Group, which noted that Big Baller Brand has received an estimated $13.2 million in advertisement as Trump and Ball exchanged barbs in recent days.

According to Jeff Eisenberg of Yahoo Sports, Apex Marketing Group calculated the estimate by tracking the number of references to Big Baller Brand in the media compared to normal advertisement rates.

""This back and forth with Donald Trump has extended the brand awareness outside of just sports,"" Apex Marketing Group president Eric Smallwood said, per Eisenberg. ""People who don't follow sports are starting to get more awareness of the brand. To have that reaction from someone as high up as Trump, it has definitely helped [Ball] reach a larger audience.""

Things escalated between the two Friday when Ball didn't personally thank Trump for helping three UCLA basketball players, including his son, LiAngelo Ball, back into the country after they shoplifted in China.

""Who?"" Ball asked ESPN.com's Arash Markazi. ""What was he over there for? Don't tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out.""

Ball wasn't done, appearing on CNN and discussing Trump with Chris Cuomo.

He refused to offer thanks during the interview either:

Naturally, Trump took to Twitter and aimed a number of critical barbs at the patriarch of the Big Baller Brand:

Eisenberg discussed the potential next step for Ball—after all the advertising—with Bob Dorfman, executive director of Baker Street Advertising. Dorfman believes he should lower the price on the $495 pair of signature shoes for Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball and also position the brand as an anti-Trump one.","los angeles lakers rookie lonzo ball

Former Real Madrid and AC Milan forward Robinho has been sentenced to nine years in prison after being found guilty of sexual assault of a 22-year-old Albanian woman in a Milanese disco in 2013.

According to Football Italia, the assault took place on January 22, 2013, when the Brazilian was contracted to AC Milan. Five other men were also found guilty in the case.

The report outlined the 33-year-old will have an opportunity to dispute the sentence as the Italian law system allows for ""several levels of appeal"" before any sentence is enforced.

Robinho later posted a statement on Instagram, as translated by the Daily Star's David Rivers:

""On the news involving striker Robinho, in fact that happened a few years ago, we clarified that he already defended himself against the charges, saying he had no participation in the episode. All legal steps are already being taken regarding this decision in the first instance.""

Robinho is currently plying his trade with Atletico Mineiro in his native Brazil, having moved back to the Brasileiro Serie A after a brief stint with Chinese Super League outfit Guangzhou Evergrande in 2015.

Robinho was also accused of raping a university student in a Leeds nightclub in January 2009, per the Telegraph's Chris Irvine. It was announced in April of that year that he would not face charges.","brasileiro serie a

UFC superstar Conor McGregor could step back into the boxing ring sooner than previously imagined after Manny Pacquiao teased the prospect of a ""real boxing match"" against the Irishman on Thursday.

The eight-division world champion posted a short but direct message to McGregor on his official Instagram with a photo of the UFC lightweight champion:

McGregor hasn't been in action in boxing or mixed martial arts since he suffered a 10th-round defeat to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in August. A big-money opportunity against Pacquiao could keep him away from the Octagon.

Pacquiao last fought in July, when he lost to Australian Jeff Horn.

The Notorious may enjoy Pacquiao's Thanksgiving invitation, too, since making money has always been among his chief priorities:

McGregor fell short in his boxing debut, as Mayweather survived an early barrage from the mixed martial artist before his stamina allowed him to run clear in the latter rounds.

But the major payday that came as a result of the crossover bout made the loss worth it in McGregor's eyes. He described himself as a ""free agent"" at the post-fight press conference, per Steven Marrocco and John Morgan of MMAjunkie:

""I have many options in MMA. I'm sure there's options that will present themselves in the boxing game. Right now, I'm a free agent. My name is on the ring.



""I'll see what's next, but I'm open. I love a good fight, and tonight was a damn good fight. I can't tell you exactly what's next, but something will be next.""

The 29-year-old Dubliner is entering what should be his fighting prime, while Pacquiao, 38, is past his best and is coming off the worst defeat of his career. Horn, a former teacher, was seen as an underdog for the ""Battle of Brisbane"" in July but came out with a controversial unanimous-decision win.

As for what UFC prospects await McGregor, interim lightweight champion Tony Ferguson has done his bit to rouse the champion's interest and recently took to Instagram (contains language NSFW):

Fans and pundits alike considered McGregor's superfight against Mayweather as a once-in-a-lifetime deal, but Pacquiao's Thanksgiving-themed poking of the bear means we may see another clash between the two sports.

Pacquiao lost to Mayweather via unanimous decision back in June 2015. While McGregor couldn't best ""Money,"" he may wonder whether he's capable of overcoming another boxing legend in Pac Man.","battle of brisbane

“Everybody is talking about the progress you’ve made in the last few months since I opened it up,” Trump told the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan, during a morning video call from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. “We’re not fighting anymore to just walk around. We’re fighting to win. You’ve turned it around over the last three to four months like nobody has seen, and they are talking about it.”

Where candidate Trump had suggested U.S. engagement in Afghanistan and Iraq was a waste of time, one year later the Commander-In-Chief embraced tackling the conflicts and the notion of lasting U.S. military wins with continued engagement. He also promised the military officials that once they came home they would return to a good economy, job opportunities and hopefully “big, fat, beautiful tax cuts.”

Trump, speaking later Thursday morning during a visit to the coast guard station in Lake Worth Inlet in Florida, thanked a group of officers for rescuing people trapped by deadly storms that pummeled the southeastern U.S. coast this year, including Hurricanes Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida. Trump touted planned new investments for the military, citing a $700 billion defense policy bill that Congress has sent for his signature.

Trump said his administration is ordering ships for the Navy and that the Air Force is getting new planes, including Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 fighter jets, which he said operated “almost like an invisible fighter.”

Invisible Plane

“I was asking the Air Force guys, I said how good is this plane?” said Trump. “You know, a fight, like I watch on the movies, a fight, they’re fighting, how good is this? They said, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it.”

He also said he’s changing the “sad” situation in which the U.S. defense industry had been selling its best equipment to foreign nations. “You know when we sell to other countries, even if they’re allies, you never know about an ally – an ally can turn,” he said. “I always say make ours a little bit better, give it that extra speed. Keep about 10 percent in the bag, because nobody has what we have.”

By video-conference call, Trump also greeted Marines in Iraq with a “Semper fi” -- the Marine Corps motto, which means “always loyal” in Latin -- and praised them for “delivering defeat after defeat to ISIS.” “We are being talked about again as an armed forces,” he said. “We are really winning, we know how to win. But we have to let you win.

“They weren’t letting you win before, they were letting you play even,” he said of his predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush.

Navy Address

He also addressed Navy members on the USS Monterey at sea, an Air Force expeditionary fighter squadron at Incirlik, Turkey, and Coast Guard members on USCG Wrangell at Kuwait Navy Base.

The president had a Thanksgiving message for journalists spending the holiday covering him. Promising the military they could have a confidential conversation once the press had been escorted from the room, Trump told the protective pool to “get out. And I’ll say, ‘You’re fired!’”

“And by the way, media, Happy Thanksgiving, I must say. Have a good Thanksgiving in Palm Beach, Florida.”","palm beach florida

As Black Friday shoppers descend on stores this weekend, retailers are experiencing something that’s been in short supply: optimism.

Brick-and-mortar chains are coming off a generally positive earnings season, with companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. seeing their shares reach record highs. Even the beleaguered department-store industry is finding reasons for hope. Macy’s Inc. and its peers rallied earlier this month after giving an upbeat outlook.

Gadfly on how Black Friday isn’t dead

Retailers are now taking that spirit into Black Friday weekend, which traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season. While the event has lost some of its buzz in recent years -- there will probably be smaller crowds and fewer shoppers fistfighting for big-screen TVs -- stores aim to build on the momentum. Companies like Target Corp. have revamped their selection and staffed up in anticipation of a merrier Christmas.

“We’re in a much stronger position entering this season,” Target Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said in an interview.

Investors remained upbeat when markets reopened Friday after Thanksgiving. Macy’s Inc. gained as much as 4.9 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent. The S&P retail index rose 0.8 percent.

“Customers today want to go to a store -- the sights, the smells, the sounds,” Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “How you can create that in a department store is a unique opportunity that we have.”

The National Retail Federation projects that about 164 million consumers -- 69 percent of Americans -- will shop at stores or online over the long weekend that started on Thanksgiving. Though Black Friday still has strong symbolism within the industry, consumers have become less loyal to the event’s promotions. Instead, they’re spending more of their holiday budgets before or after Thanksgiving.

Sales Growth

Overall holiday spending is expected to climb as much as 4 percent from last year, helped by low unemployment and rising home values. The purchases will amount to roughly $680 billion in November and December, the Washington-based NRF estimates.

Market-analysis firm NPD Group sees positive momentum forming, with sales for a basket of merchandise up about 6 percent in the first two weeks of November from a year ago. Movement has been particularly brisk for apparel, athletic footwear, beauty and small appliances, the group said.

Retailers have been offering deals online and in stores all week, aiming to get a jump on Black Friday and cut through the noise. The early indications are positive, said Jerry Storch, head of Storch Advisors and the former CEO of Hudson’s Bay Co.

“The question will be, who’s going to win and who’s going to lose?” he said.

Plenty of major retailers continue to languish, and it’s hard to tell if the holidays will bring them much relief. Comparable sales -- a key measure -- plunged 17 percent last quarter at Sears and 12 percent at J. Crew stores.

Amazon.com Inc., of course, is poised to be one of the winners. The e-commerce giant recently overtook Wal-Mart as the top toy destination, helped by low prices, according to Jefferies LLC analyst Stephanie Wissink.

Online King

Amazon will account for about 44 percent of U.S. retail e-commerce sales this year, making it the undisputed leader online, according to EMarketer Inc.

And e-commerce sales have started off strong this holiday season. So far, $30.4 billion has been spent online in November, according to Adobe Systems Inc. data. That’s up 18 percent from a year earlier.

But internet sales represent less than 12 percent of total holiday retail purchases, EMarketer estimates. That means there’s still plenty of opportunities for brick-and-mortar chains to thrive.

Stores also are getting smarter about how they do sales and discounts, said Charlie O’Shea, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.

“The retailers are getting more tactical with promotions -- with online marketing and a whole lot of other stuff happening,” he said. “You’re going to see more creative promotions.”

About 77 percent of retailers that already reported third-quarter earnings met or exceeded analysts’ projections, according to data compiled by research firm Retail Metrics. Analysts have boosted their year-end earnings estimates for the S&P 500 retail index over the past month by more than any year since 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

That’s given investors more confidence that the sector is finally seeing a comeback. The S&P 500 retail index has risen 23 percent so far this year, compared with a 16 percent gain for the overall index.

Disaster Recovery

Even so, recent hurricanes and other natural disasters still loom over the industry. Consumers in hard-hit areas may be more focused on getting back on their feet, A.T. Kearney partner Ryan Fisher said in a report.

“This holiday period won’t be great for retailers serving the charred remains of neighborhoods in Santa Rosa, California, or the storm-ravaged communities across the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, where consumers are going to be spending their money -- assuming they have any to spend -- rebuilding rather than accessorizing,” he said.

To maintain momentum, retailers will be trying to capitalize on shoppers combining in-store and e-commerce purchases. Though almost 90 percent of consumers are planning to visit physical stores, many plan to complete their shopping lists online, a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP found. That means chains have to make sure in-store shoppers are using their websites as well.

It will take time to see how it all plays out, Storch said.

“Black Friday I expect to be strong,” he said. “And then we’ll see what happens.”

Ari Natter,Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC said it resumed repairing Puerto Rico’s storm-ravaged electric grid after receiving a payment from the territory’s bankrupt utility.,2017-11-23T19:27:36Z,bloomberg,Whitefish Resumes Restoring Power to Puerto Rico After Payment,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-23/whitefish-resumes-restoring-power-to-puerto-rico-after-payment,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4.KZxDJl7Uw/v1/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC said it resumed repairing Puerto Rico’s storm-ravaged electric grid after receiving a payment from the territory’s bankrupt utility.

The company, which saw its no-bid $300 million contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority canceled last month amid criticism, said Monday it was suspending work because it was owed $83 million. Under the terms of the canceled deal, Whitefish was supposed to continue work until Nov. 30.

The tiny Montana-based company is under investigation after securing a sole-source contract with the PREPA to restore power on the island, which lost 80 percent of its electric grid after a pair of hurricanes in September.

“PREPA released a payment to Whitefish Energy that was enough to show PREPA’s good faith intent to pay Whitefish Energy and its subcontractors for services rendered,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday. Chris Chiames, a Whitefish spokesman, declined to answer a question about the size of the payment. A spokesman for PREPA didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

A Nov. 19 letter from Whitefish to the bankrupt utility, which was obtained by Bloomberg News, demands payment for work it has performed -- and also more than $39 million ""for anticipated demobilization costs.""

The company had two full-time employees and little experience prior to winning the PREPA contract. Whitefish is based in the tiny hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose son worked for the company. Both Zinke and Whitefish Energy say the cabinet secretary played no role in the selection of Whitefish.

About 50 percent of the island’s power capacity has been restored, according to the Energy Department.","puerto rico electric power authority

The Switzerland-based online trader called its offering the first actively managed bitcoin certificate. Funds will be shifted between the digital currency and cash based on an algorithm that will use “technical signals” and sentiment expressed on social media to try to forecast the market. Trading will take place on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

Online trading firms, hedge funds and foreign-exchange platforms are launching new bitcoin products to try to get onboard a rally that has seen the biggest cryptocurrency surge eightfold this year. Traders are hungry for ways to hedge downside risk and adopt flexible positions after three separate slumps of more than 25 percent this year and a raft of commentators warning of a bubble.

“Investors are excited about the cryptocurrency but are unnerved by its volatility,” Peter Rosenstreich, the bank’s head of market strategy, said in an interview. “So we tried to build a trading algorithm that’s a protection against downside risks”

Swissquote said in a statement Thursday it will hold the cryptocurrency and a buffer of dollars that ranges from zero to 40 percent of the certificate’s portfolio, depending on its quantitative algorithmic trading strategy. The exposure is limited to bitcoin and cash, minus a 1.5 percent management fee and trading costs, it said.

Investor Mike Novogratz, who’s setting up a $500 million hedge fund to invest in digital currencies, said this week bitcoin will end the year at $10,000. The cryptocurrency fell 1 percent to $8,123.36 at 11:05 a.m. in London on Thursday.

Eight men found on the northwestern coast of Japan late Thursday claim to be North Koreans whose boat broke down and drifted ashore on a fishing trip hundreds of miles from home.

Japan will deal ""appropriately"" with the men, whose nationalities haven’t been confirmed but who appear to be in good health, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo on Friday. Public broadcaster NHK said the men have asked to be returned to North Korea.

Wooden boats have been reported as drifting to the Japanese coast on 43 occasions this year, but the group appear to be the first to survive the grueling experience in almost three years. One man was found to have done so in January 2015, according to Japan’s coast guard.

The men were discovered after police responded to an emergency call reporting ""suspicious people,"" Suga said. They were apprehended at Yurihonjo in Akita Prefecture, and a 20-meter long wooden squid-fishing boat was found close by, according to NHK.

The incident comes as Japan urges the international community to ratchet up pressure on North Korea to abandon its missile and nuclear-weapon programs. In September, the Pyongyang regime fired its second missile over Japan in as many months.

Earlier this month, Japan rescued a group of three fishermen whose boat had capsized in the Sea of Japan, and returned them to a North Korean ship.","japans akita prefecture

PDVSA, as the oil producer is known, called on different business units, subsidiaries, joint ventures and staff to adhere to a long list of cost-cutting reforms amid the “national economic emergency” without affecting daily crude output, according to a memo sent to employees on Thursday that was seen by Bloomberg. PDVSA and the country’s Oil Ministry confirmed the contents of the memo.

Joint venture partners must submit financing plans, projects with no financing will be halted, training outside of Venezuela will only be conducted when strictly necessary and international transportation, including the use of PDVSA aircrafts, should be reduced to a minimum, the memo said. Credit card use must be in line with company policy and the use of video conferences will be promoted to cut costs of bringing employees face-to-face.

The call to tighten belts at the country’s biggest company adds to other attempts by President Nicolas Maduro’s government to head off a crisis sparked by low oil prices, a refusal to enact economic measures to correct imbalances and a political impasse that has further split society. Last week, the Foreign Ministry sent an email to diplomats worldwide to renegotiate rents of embassies and consulates or look for cheaper locations. With international reserves near a 15-year-low, the socialist nation has been plagued with shortages of everything from antibiotics and food.

In its latest financial report for full year 2016 that was released in August, profit at Petroleos de Venezuela sank almost 90 percent year-on-year while contributions to key social programs dried up. The Caracas-based company’s refineries are operating at significantly reduced rates with some “completely paralyzed,” according to Ivan Freites, the head of an oil workers union.

Output is expected to slump to 1.84 million barrels a day next year, the lowest compared with official government data since 1989, according to a survey with four analysts compiled by Bloomberg.

Other policy changes unveiled in the memo include rules around assigning company vehicles, the practice of booking hotel rooms on a continuous basis and improving the screening of employees based on merits and education. PDVSA called on reductions in the use of electricity, water, mobile telephones, aircards for Internet, computing gear and expenses for publicity and propaganda.

Even after paying billions of dollars in the past month to make debt payments, PDVSA is behind on other bond interest payments, prompting credit rating companies to cut the firm’s credit to selective default. The price on its bonds due 2022 stands at 30 cents on the dollar from as high as 67 cents in March.","petroleos de venezuela

Laurie Woolever,"Get to know the term “stunt turkey,” and don’t be too generous with your guests.",2017-11-14T11:00:10Z,bloomberg,"You’re Doing Thanksgiving Wrong, Says Anthony Bourdain",http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-14/you-re-doing-thanksgiving-wrong-says-anthony-bourdain,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iEAUPtl9kb68/v0/1200x780.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Get to know the term “stunt turkey,” and don’t be too generous with your guests.

If there’s one meal at which family drama is on full display, it’s Thanksgiving. Expectations and emotions run high, and there are a lot of moving parts to cause friction. Even Anthony Bourdain, who is seemingly immune to the criticism of others, feels the pressure to pull off the most anticipated meal of the year. In fact, he dedicated a whole chapter to Thanksgiving in the book I co-wrote with him last year, Appetites: A Cookbook. There, you’ll find recipes from Tony that are capable of distracting from any and all uncomfortable conversations.

Anthony Bourdain knows how to host a Thanksgiving meal. Photographer: Bobby Fisher

Below, a list of exactly what you’re doing wrong for the big day.

1. Don’t start cooking on Thanksgiving Day.

Preparing your whole meal in one day— even two—is a recipe for system failure. Order your fancy farmer-raised turkey now. Or, if you are going to buy a more plebian bird from a regular market, get your hands on it no later than the Monday before Thanksgiving.

2. You’re not planning well enough.

Plan for three days—that’s right, three days—of full-on Thanksgiving prep. Make a list of everything that needs to get done and follow it. The Tuesday before Thanksgiving, you should be organizing your supplies and tools, making sure you have enough roasting pans, mixing bowls, and storage containers ,and banging out advance vegetable prep.

3. You’re not giving yourself enough time to thaw everything out.

Stay close to the classics, advises Bourdain. Photographer: Bobby Fisher

Do not wait until Thanksgiving to lay out your non-perishables and frozen items. The vast majority of holiday turkeys are sold frozen, and it takes about six hours per pound to defrost in the refrigerator. No amount of prayer, salting, or hastily applied hairdryers can speed up this process if you’ve waited until Wednesday to thaw a 12-pound bird. Your microwave isn’t big enough. You can jolly it along a bit with a cold water bath, which thaws the meat at approximately 30 minutes per pound, but do not float your turkey in your bathtub.

4. Don’t forget to make stock when it’s all over. It’s liquid gold for cold weather.

Stock is the underrated superhero of the Thanksgiving meal, the product that comes out of nowhere to save almost everything except your pie. You should make stock out of your Thanksgiving turkey carcass—but the use of a good, dark, gelatinous-when-refrigerated stock that you have on hand before the meal is what’s going to upgrade your stuffing and gravy. Buy about five to seven pounds of turkey wings and necks as the base for a deeply-roasted stock, or invest in a couple of quarts of the best-quality turkey stock you can find a few days (or weeks) before the holidays. Use the stock made from your Thanksgiving birds for winter soups and stews.

5. You only make one turkey? That’s hilarious.

Meet the stunt turkey (and use it for leftovers). Photographer: Bobby Fisher

My top Thanksgiving rule: Prepare a stunt turkey and a business turkey. My motto is “never let ‘em see you sweat.” To impress guests, roast and artfully arrange a small turkey, using any and all manner of garnishes and props, including (but not limited to): chop frills, rainbow pinwheels of skewered citrus fruit slices, maraschino cherries, curly kale, lit sparklers, and crisp, new $100 bills and/or gold leaf. While guests admire your artistry (and drink your Burgundy), carve the larger, roasted business turkey in the kitchen. The stunt turkey should be edible, of course. Use it to supplement the meal as needed, or lean on it entirely for care packages and day-after leftovers. (See below.)

6. Don’t throw away the fat.

Do not discard the copious amounts of grease your bird has generously provided you with; use it to boost flavor. Butter is good, but turkey fat is better for delivering quintessential flavor. Save the grease that runs off the roasted birds and use it for the gravy and as a moistening agent for your stuffing.

7. Don’t try anything crazy. This is not the time for wild experimentation.

Appetites: A Cookbook, by Anthony Bourdain and Laurie Woolever.

Stick with tradition on Thanksgiving. You have 364 days of the year to experiment with the cuisines of the world, your dehydrator, and your sous vide machine. Give the people what they want on Thanksgiving: the likes of buttery mashed potatoes, savory stuffing with mushrooms or chestnuts or oysters, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cranberry relish, bacon-enhanced Brussels sprouts, creamed onions, pumpkin or apple pie with real whipped cream, and above all, a straight-ahead bronzed turkey, roasted in the oven.

8. Don’t give it all away at the end of the meal.

A good turkey sandwich, enhanced with a layer of stuffing and gravy, eaten in peace after your guests have gone, is the whole point of hosting Thanksgiving in the first place. By all means, send your friends and family home with care packages—but first, make sure you’ve tucked away enough additional stuff for yourself.","gelatinouswhenrefrigerated

Tim Culpan,The billionaire investor needs more than 280 characters for this story.,2017-11-23T19:00:12Z,bloomberg,"Mark Cuban Is Right, But a Tweet's Not Enough",https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-11-23/mark-cuban-is-right-but-a-tweet-s-not-enough,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irVDIf3NwN20/v0/1200x353.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Mark Cuban had a question for the U.S. president, and he took to @realDonaldTrump's favored communication tool to pose it.

@realDonaldTrump did you realize that 5pct of the increase in stock market value ($250Billion) and 7.5x our Monthly Trade Deficit w China has gone to one Chinese company? https://t.co/CE5aXcAamH — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) November 22, 2017

The investor, billionaire and basketball fan was asking a rhetorical question, of course.

Cuban was referring to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and linked to one of many blog posts penned by a relentless, witty and deeply analytical critic of Jack Ma's empire called, unoriginally, Deep Throat.

Being a Gadfly, I went through Cuban's numbers for a bit of a fact check. Conclusion: he knows his stuff. But keep reading.

Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares have climbed 116 percent this year, taking its market cap to $486 billion by the close of trading Wednesday. That's equal to a $261 billion increase year-to-date. Given that the stock is up slightly this week, and assuming Cuban did his calculations earlier in the week, he's pretty much dead on.

Quite a Rise Alibaba's market value climbed $261 billion this year through Nov. 22, in line with Mark Cuban's calculations Source: Bloomberg

As for the 5 percent, he may actually be underplaying it a little, but Cuban didn't specify which stock market he's referring to, so there's some leeway. If he meant the NYSE Composite Index, that measure is up 12.1 percent for the year, adding about $2.61 trillion to its market cap. So Alibaba's gain is close to 10 percent. For the MSCI World Index, which tracks 1,652 global stocks, Alibaba's increase is equivalent to about 4.6 percent of the added value.

Cuban later responded to me, explaining that his 5 percent figure was based on Trump's own claim of a $5 trillion increase in stocks. The market value of securities on the NYSE (where Alibaba is listed) plus the Nasdaq has risen by a combined $4.8 trillion this year, so that figure is broadly correct.

All Rise The total market value of common stocks, ADRs, REITs and tracking stocks listed on the NYSE has climbed $2.6 trillion this year through Nov. 22

It's where Cuban talks about trade that things get a little weird. He's right: The U.S. trade deficit with China was $34.6 billion in September, and 7.5 times that figure is $260 billion. Pretty close to Alibaba's rise in market value.

On Balance The U.S. trade deficit with China tends to range between $20 billion and $40 billion per month Source: Bloomberg, U.S. Census Bureau

But that data point is irrelevant to Alibaba's trade impact on the U.S. economy. Alibaba, including its Taobao marketplace, is primarily a platform for Chinese trading with Chinese. Alibaba's non-China revenue last year was 24 percent of its total, with even less -- 8.4 percent -- derived from international commerce, coming to just $2 billion. The remainder of its overseas sales came from digital media, entertainment, and cloud computing.

Bear in mind that Alibaba's revenue has little to do with its transaction volume, (aka gross merchandise value) -- a drum I have banged many times. In fact, Alibaba is primarily a media company deriving its revenue from selling ads to merchants.

Data on this is hazy at best, but given that so few Americans have even heard of Taobao or TMall, much less use them, it's fair to argue that not many U.S. shoppers are turning to Alibaba for help importing Chinese products. Jack Ma himself has said that just 2 percent of the company's sales come from the U.S., though its unclear if he meant transaction volume or revenue.

Where America doesn't shop Taobao

That said, Alibaba has become a valuable tool for small-business owners to source product, but I'd hazard that Amazon.com Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are doing a better job of matching Chinese sellers with U.S. buyers. Meanwhile, Chinese people are using Alibaba to buy U.S. products such as iPhones.

Who Made the Money U.S. investors made more than $190 billion from Alibaba's share price rise this year Source: Bloomberg

Then there's wealth creation. More than 74 percent of Alibaba's New York-listed ADRs are owned by U.S. shareholders. That's $194 billion of increased market value from Alibaba's share price flowing to American investors, which is more than the country's aggregate trade deficit with China for the first six months of 2017.

Mark Cuban, one of the world's smartest businessmen, knows there's a story to be told about Alibaba and the U.S. But he's going to need more than 280 characters to tell it.

This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Analysts gave differing outlooks for U.S. shale output in a briefing to officials from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, stoking concern ahead of OPEC’s planned meeting on Nov. 30, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The analysts included Andy Hall, the veteran crude trader who closed his hedge fund this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the briefing was private.

The duration of any extension in output limits will depend partly on estimates of future supplies of U.S. shale and other competing crudes. OPEC and allied producers including Russia are to gather next week in Vienna to assess oil markets and decide whether to extend their historic cuts beyond March. Several OPEC ministers, including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih, have expressed support for longer cuts, which took effect in January.

Some OPEC officials are uneasy that no one seems to have a clear view of just how much shale oil will be hitting the market, the people said.

Forecasts of 2018 growth in shale output range from 500,000 barrels a day to as much as 1.7 million barrels a day, complicating any forecasts, Hall said at the briefing, according to the people with knowledge of his comments. Hall, once known in the oil industry as “God” for his lucrative trades, said the U.S. Energy Information Administration is underestimating this year’s growth in shale oil by about 300,000 barrels a day, according to the people.

Wide Range

Other participants in the briefing included Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad Energy AS; Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.; and analysts from Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley, according to the people with knowledge of the discussions on Wednesday in the Austrian capital.

Rystad’s Nysveen said shale output will gain on average by about 1.2 million barrels a day each year through 2020, due largely to producers’ more efficient use of capital, according to the people. Rapid expansion in shale output will remain a U.S. phenomenon, as other regions of the world lack such promising prospects, said Marianne Kah, the former chief economist for ConocoPhillips, according to the people.

Cuts by OPEC and other suppliers to clear a glut have helped lift oil from lows of less than $30 a barrel last year. With West Texas Intermediate crude trading at more than $55 a barrel, producers in the U.S. are drilling more wells to boost production.

The U.S. is set to pump about 9.2 million barrels a day on average this year, before raising output to a record 9.9 million in 2018, the EIA said in the short-term energy outlook it issued this month. U.S. crude production climbed to a record 9.66 million last week, the EIA said.","us energy information administration

Trump.",2017-11-23T11:14:34Z,breitbart-news,Thanksgiving Update: Mitch McConnell Losing the War Against Republican Base,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/23/thanksgiving-update-mitch-mcconnell-losing-the-war-against-republican-base/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/GettyImages-874208016.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is badly losing the war he is waging against his own party’s voters this Thanksgiving, a sign of the failed GOP leader’s waning power in the era of President Donald J. Trump.

Just over a couple weeks from now, conservative Judge Roy Moore is expected to defeat radical Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama’s special election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by now Attorney General Jeff Sessions—and that is just the beginning of a larger wave brewing against McConnell. After Jones goes down, as polls indicate he will, and Moore is elected to the Senate, McConnell faces a rash of electoral events coming up next year that are likely to further destabilize his power structure in the Senate—all while struggling this year to get anything done for President Trump’s agenda.

McConnell’s last-ditch effort to stop Moore in Alabama came over the past couple weeks after evidence-free allegations against Moore allege he engaged in sexual misconduct decades ago. Within minutes of the allegations first appearing in the Washington Post, McConnell and his legion of Senate GOP allies called for Moore to “step aside.” But, upon further review, the allegations have not held up under scrutiny and the stories of the accusers have begun crumbling with actual reporting into the details of them. Gloria Allred, the attorney for one of them, has refused in interviews on CNN and MSNBC to deny that the only piece of evidence she offered to back up her claims—a yearbook she and her client claim Moore signed years ago—is a forgery.

McConnell has gone all out to try to stop Moore.

“Senate Republicans are running out of options in their effort to replace Roy Moore as the party’s nominee in the Alabama Senate race,” Alex Bolton wrote in The Hill this past weekend describing McConnell’s failed efforts. “In the past week, they tried to pressure Moore to drop out by siding with the women who accused him of sexual misconduct. He refused. They tried to coax President Trump into calling for Moore’s ouster. Trump declined. They tried to convince the Alabama Republican Party to disqualify Moore as the nominee or to schedule a new election. Those officials said no. They tried to find a write-in candidate to challenge Moore, but their first choice, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, signaled through allies he wasn’t interested. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), went so far as to call for a vote to expel Moore from the Senate should he win the Dec. 12 special election. Nothing has worked. Moore is still in the race.”

Instead of succeeding in ousting Moore from the race, the entire attack has backfired. Moore has shot back repeatedly at McConnell on the campaign trail, reiterating his call for McConnell to step aside as Senate Majority Leader.

“This is an effort by Mitch McConnell and his cronies to steal this election from the people of Alabama,” Moore said at a news conference in Birmingham, Alabama, last week.

Meanwhile, President Trump has come forward and called out liberal Democrat Jones’ record—and emphasized that Moore has denied the allegations against him.

Alabama is the least of McConnell’s worries now. McConnell has failed to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is already facing difficulty in passing tax cuts. Both of those agenda items his House counterparts passed with ease. More than 300 bills that have passed the House this year languish in the McConnell-run Senate. But as next year rolls around, passing agenda items may be the least of McConnell’s concerns.

In elections across the country, McConnell-aligned forces are dropping like flies. McConnell spent more than $30 million attempting to prop up appointed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) in the Alabama special election only to have Moore smoke him on Sept. 26 by nearly double digits. That same day, McConnell ally Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)—the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee—announced his intent to retire next year. That cleared the way for conservative Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) to step up as the clear frontrunner for the U.S. Senate in Tennessee.

A couple weeks later, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) announced his intent to retire as well—clearing the way for former state senator Dr. Kelli Ward in Arizona. Blackburn and Ward are unlikely to just be handed their respective nominations—McConnell’s establishment forces are desperate to find alternatives to both of them—but are both likely to win.

Meanwhile, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) is likely to retire in Utah—setting the stage for a battle for control of that Senate seat between conservatives and the anti-Republican Party base potential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney, the failed GOP nominee for president in 2012, is a former governor of Massachusetts. After he lost the 2012 election, he turned on the GOP and pushed his former party to support amnesty for illegal aliens and back corporatist policies that would severely harm GOP voters. If Romney were to carpetbag into Utah to try to run for Senate there, it would spark a severe war inside the party—and lay all of Romney’s deep, dark financial history out to bare for the whole world to see.

Over in Mississippi, state Sen. Chris McDaniel—from whom McConnell allies stole the 2014 GOP nomination for Senate when McDaniel ran against Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) using underhanded tactics that backfired in 2016’s presidential primaries—is plotting a potential bid against Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS). McDaniel would be a formidable candidate against Wicker, and establishment forces close to McConnell in Washington, D.C., tell Breitbart News that the Senate Majority Leader is very worried about that race.

That then brings up Wyoming, where Blackwater founder Erik Prince is mulling a bid against incumbent Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY)—something that would likely be an easy win for Prince as Wyoming voters are some of the most conservative in the country. Then, of course, there is Nevada—where Danny Tarkanian is running against incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in a state Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton won in 2016—causing even more worry for McConnell.

That’s not to mention other states like Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where voters and GOP forces are aligning against McConnell en masse. Not one Senate candidate in 2018 is openly supporting McConnell remaining Majority Leader, as even top National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) recruits like Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, Ohio treasurer Josh Mandel, and Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) understand the toxicity McConnell brings upon the party.

In Wisconsin, the clear frontrunner businessman Kevin Nicholson—who is running far ahead of the establishment-backed state Sen. Leah Vukmir—has openly called for new leadership in the GOP-led Senate. Vukmir, who has fallen behind Nicholson, has rebuked calls from her own party’s voters for fresh leadership different than McConnell.

That all doesn’t even begin to get into the issues McConnell faces as two of his more senior members, Cochran in Mississippi and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in Arizona, have serious health issues that could imperil their long-term service prospects. With establishment members under fire in both states–Flake has already stepped aside, and Wicker is likely to face a brutal primary challenge with little chance of victory–that presents an opportunity for conservatives who want fresh, new GOP leadership other than McConnell in the U.S. Senate to flip four seats instead of just two.

If McConnell fails to pass tax cuts this year, he is likely to face an even more unforgiving electorate next year. But even if he does pass tax cuts, the voters across America are unlikely to give him any breaks at the polls when his allies face the fire and Republicans pushing for fresh leadership win in landslides.","national republican senatorial committee nrsc

Alabama Today reported on the poll from Sky Research showing Moore with 46.7 percent compared to Jones’ 39.6 percent, with 13.7 percent undecided. The poll was conducted on Nov. 21 and had a margin of error of 3.1 percent.

advertisement

That poll comes just days after another poll, by Atlantic Media and Research, showed Moore up by six points. The Sky Research poll could still be swung Jones’ way by undecided voters, but that would appear unlikely.

Moore has been dogged by allegations of sexual impropriety after he was accused of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old when he was in his 30s. Since then a number of women have come forward and said he pursued them when they were teenagers.

But Moore’s fortunes have changed recently. A widely spread claim that he was banned from a local mall for preying on teenagers was debunked by the former mall manager, casting doubt on some of the mainstream media reporting on the allegations.

Moore also got a boost by an endorsement this week from President Trump:

“He totally denies it. He says it didn’t happen,” Trump said. “Forty years is a long time. He’s run eight races, and this has never come up.”

Another good sign for Moore is that 62.3 percent of the respondents identified as Republican, suggesting that Jones has an uphill climb to get Alabamians to vote for him.

Trump also reminded the deep-red state that it may not want a “liberal Democrat” representing them in the Senate.

“I’ve looked at his record. It’s terrible on crime. It’s terrible on the border. It’s terrible on the military,” Trump said. “I can tell you for a fact, we do not need somebody that’s going to be bad on crime, bad on borders, bad with the military, bad for the Second Amendment.”

The Center for Food Safety cites University of Manchester researchers’ claim that a turkey and all-the-trimmings meal for eight people produces 44 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. And the life of the bird at the center of the table contributes about 60 percent of that planet-warming gas.

The Baltimore Sun’s Meredith Cohn and Tim Wheeler wrote:

And [those figures don’t] include drinks. Leave it to the Brits to rain on our traditions. But it was brought to my attention by the Washington-based Center for Food Safety, which wants Americans to lay off food produced by “industrial agriculture” for the sake of the planet, if not their health.

“Choosing the type of food we eat – organic versus conventional meats and veggies, makes a great difference in greenhouse gas emissions,” Debi Barker, the Center’s international director, said, adding that about 14 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions are connected to industrial agriculture methods, she contends.

“Our take on that is to empower ourselves,” Barker said. “If you’re buying organic, you’re really taking a bite out of climate [change].”

The Baltimore Sun also talked to Mike Tidwell, head of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network in Takoma Park, who said eating farm-raised meat, fish, or fowl — including turkeys — is “high-impact” when it comes to climate change.

Tidwell said he is a vegetarian because of his concerns about climate change — except on Thanksgiving.

“You caught me, with my one exception,” Tidwell said.

Meanwhile, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies reported that climate change could cause problems for another Thanksgiving stable, the pumpkin.

Yale Climate Connections reported:

There’s a good chance the pumpkin in your Thanksgiving pie came from Morton, Illinois. This pumpkin paradise produces most of the nation’s holiday squash. But dark skies may loom ahead. Pumpkins are fair weather fruit; squash rots in squishy fields. And in 2015, record rainfall put a big dent in canned pumpkin production. It was not the first time America’s top squash crop got soaked. And Illinois State Climatologist Jim Angel says it will not be the last.

“Probably our biggest concern right now and into the future is that we’ve been trending toward wetter conditions,” Angel said.

Some 100,000 tons of pumpkins are processed in Morton each year, according to the article.

“There are still more good years than bad. But pumpkin shortages could become more common as the climate continues to change.”","yale school of forestry and environmental studies

In a video posted to his social media accounts on Thursday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) offered a Thanksgiving greetings accompanied by a politically charged message for his supporters.

advertisement

After declaring Thanksgiving “his favorite holiday,” Sanders touted the Republican-controlled Congress’ inability to repeal parts of Obamacare and credited supporters as the reason.

“I don’t have to tell anybody that from a political point of view, this has been a horrendous year,” Sanders said. “It appears that almost every day, there is something coming out the White House that is embarrassing, that is destructive, that is horrific. And that’s the bad news. But the good news is that because the American people from coast-to-coast have begun the process of standing up and fighting back we have won some very significant victories despite the fact that right-wing Republicans control the White House, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Because of what you did, people all across the country — a Republican effort to throw 30 million Americans off of health insurance failed. We beat them back.”

Sanders went on to add that same effort would be needed to defeat the tax proposal Republicans are considering in Congress.

“And because of your effort, we’re going to take them on on their disastrous tax proposal to get massive tax breaks to billionaires, while at the same time raising taxes the millions of people in the middle class. We’re going to beat them on that as well it is clear not just to me but do I think almost everybody of the American people are catching on as to what a disaster, what a political disaster Trump and the Republican leadership are about.”

He went on to urge viewers to “take on Trump and move the country forward in a progressive way.”

Mr. Flynn’s lawyers had been sharing information with Mr. Trump’s lawyers about the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved in Russian efforts to undermine Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

That agreement has been terminated, the four people said. Defense lawyers frequently share information during investigations, but they must stop when doing so would pose a conflict of interest. It is unethical for lawyers to work together when one client is cooperating with prosecutors and another is still under investigation.

The notification alone does not prove that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with Mr. Mueller. Some lawyers withdraw from information-sharing arrangements as soon as they begin negotiating with prosecutors. And such negotiations sometimes fall apart.

Still, the notification led Mr. Trump’s lawyers to believe that Mr. Flynn — who, along with his son, is seen as having significant criminal exposure — has, at the least, begun discussions with Mr. Mueller about cooperating.","informationsharing

Robert Pittenger (R-NC) during an international forum on the nexus between drug cartels and Islamic extremists.

“Hezbollah is partnering with Latin American drug lords to raise money for terrorist activity. This includes participation in drug trafficking, gun running, and trade-based money laundering,” declared the North Carolina Republican before traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to lead the ninth Parliamentary Intelligence-Security Forum on Tuesday. “The combination of radical Islamic terrorists and violent drug lords is a serious threat to national security.”

advertisement

The U.S. State Department and the American military have conceded that Shiite Hezbollah militants and to a lesser extent Sunni Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) jihadists maintain a presence in Latin America.

As chief of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) in charge of American military operations in most of Latin America and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, retired Gen. John Kelly highlighted the ongoing threat against the United States posed by the relationship between drug cartels and Islamic terrorist groups.

Echoing Kelly at the Argentina-based forum attended by 200 lawmakers and security officials from 15 Latin American nations, Rep. Pittenger, the chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, stressed:

South America is quickly emerging as a front line in the fight against terrorist organizations and organized crime. Hezbollah and other Middle Eastern Islamic terrorist organizations are partnering with Latin American drug cartels in order to raise money to fund their terrorist objectives. Their activities include drug trafficking, gun running, and money laundering. Islamic Terrorist are teaming up with violent drug lords located in America’s backyard. While their collaboration has intentionally been discreet, nevertheless their nefarious activities pose a grave threat to our national security and that of our democratic partners across the globe.

Late last year, the House Financial Services Committee Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing reported that Iran’s narco-terrorist proxy Hezbollah is operating a “virtually unopposed drug trafficking operation” in South America, adding that the jihadi group uses its lucrative proceeds estimated in the hundreds of millions to fund its operations in the Middle East.

Rep. Pittenger is the vice chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.

As its funding sources dry up and its so-called caliphate shrinks, a desperate ISIS is reportedly resorting to drug trafficking to fund its terrorist activities.

“The nexus between criminal networks and terrorist networks is real, and I will predict it will get more sophisticated,” proclaimed then-DHS Secretary John Kelly in April.

Adm. Kurt Tidd, Kelly’s successor as SOUTHCOM commander, noted that radical Islamists and Latin American transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) working together, perhaps unwittingly, is “not totally impossible” as previously thought.

Tidd warned that their collaboration is not limited to drug trafficking, noting that jihadist groups like ISIS are seeking to “radicalize and recruit” people in Latin American regions where the violent street gang MS-13 operates.

Retired Gen. Kelly, who now serves as U.S. President Trump’s chief of staff, has cautioned that ISIS-affiliate Boko Haram and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are allowing Latin American drug cartels to traffic cocaine into Europe with the help of Hezbollah.

Joseph Humire, an expert on Iranian influence in Latin America and director at the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), told Breitbart News that Latin American cartels are paying Hezbollah a “tax” to move people, narcotics, weapons and other contraband in and out of the Western Hemisphere.

Boko Haram has also been affiliated with smuggling Afghanistan-based heroin into Europe.

ISIS’s top stronghold in Afghanistan, Nangarhar, is one of the top-poppy producing provinces in the country, the world’s top supplier of opium and its heroin derivative.

Although experts believe Hezbollah is the most prominent jihadist group in Latin America, Kelly has warned that Sunni extremists are radicalizing converts and other Muslims in Latin America, adding that ISIS may exploit trafficking organizations in the region to infiltrate the United States.","house financial services committee task force

Socialism, Western pro-liberty thinkers know, is a tragic-comic failure, rearing its head in failed states like Venezuela to remind us to never revisit that history. China, many Western thinkers argue, isn’t “really” communist, and its booming economy will soon lead to a booming marketplace of ideas.

advertisement

In his new book, Bully of Asia, author (and Breitbart contributor) Steven W. Mosher makes the compelling argument that trying to understand Xi Jinping’s rise to power is impossible if the West insists on studying Chinese history from the era of Mao Zedong. Instead, he contends, one must look to the history that informed and inspired the modern tyrants of China, and in particular the success of Qin Shihuang, China’s first emperor, in ending the existence of China’s nation-states.

Qin Shihuang, Mosher argues, “accomplished the ‘Grand Unification’ of China, ending the fearful ‘chaos and disorder’ of the Warring States period and ushering in ‘peace under Heaven'” in the eyes of modern Chinese leaders. “Grand Unification” and “Great Uniformity” are positive, not creepy, terms to the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the latter Mosher defining as “a literal uniformity of thought and action that does not arise from below but is instead imposed from above.”

Qin did this in 247 B.C., and Chinese authoritarians have been emulating him since.

The oppression of Tibet, crackdowns in Hong Kong, and China’s illegal invasion of the South China Sea all stem from a desire to unify the planet under Chinese rule as Qin thought he had done in his time, Mosher contends.

For lovers of ancient history who, like me, have bored of the antics of Nero and Caracalla, Bully of Asia offers a similarly colorful profile of the men who made Chinese history (and, yes, they are by and large men). From Qin to the King of Zhou and later, Mao Zedong, Jiang Zemin, and Xi Jinping himself, the book’s characters spring out of the pages with colorful and often comical anecdotes. Larger-than-life figures like Tamerlane and Henry Kissinger make cameos, often as straight-men characters to the outrageous doings of the Chinese leaders.

As fun as the book is to read for its narrative qualities, however, it also imparts an important warning about China: it has had millennia to perfect totalitarianism, and its leaders do not want to stop now. The legalists of China’s last millennium B.C. established government systems that forced spouses to report each other for “crimes,” commanded the burning of inconvenient books, and rewrote the teachings of Confucius to their benefit.

Mosher argues that, instead of imposing foreign Marxism on China, Mao reinstated the ancient legalist ways of running the country.

There are two major points of Mosher’s with which I contend: the relative lack of influence that he believes Marxism has on the behavior of the Chinese government and the reasons he is so quick to dismiss Russia as a threat to America.

On the latter point, Mosher is absolutely correct to highlight that Russia’s meager economy and thuggish plutocrats do not offer the world an ideology with the coherence and strength to challenge American values. No country in the world wants to be Russia; they didn’t before the fall of the USSR and they certainly don’t now.

Yet Mosher goes so far as to argue that President Vladimir Putin does not really care to conquer the world, instead seeking “a retreat into Russia’s Tsarist past.”

“There is no reason to believe Tsar Vladimir Putin dreams that his own power will one day eclipse America’s,” he claims.

This theory leaves much of Putin’s behavior outside of the post-Soviet world – in Iran and Syria, in Cuba and Venezuela, in Morocco and Egypt – unexplained. I would venture to guess that, based on Putin’s insistence that Russia have a stake in the future of these disparate regions, a Russia with China’s economic means would just as much want to take over the world as the CPC itself.

On the former point, it is hard to disagree with Mosher that Xi’s China looks a lot more like Qin Shihuang’s empire than Kim Il-sung’s. Yet his dismissal of communism as a tool to impose Chinese-style legalism with little weight beyond that within the CPC, I believe, takes too lightly the viral power of Marxist thought. Marxism has served to erase parts of the ethnic supremacist doctrine of legalism and impose an expectation that China will be a multi-class society, both new and dangerous concepts that make China’s ideology more alluring to foreigners.

Mosher clearly states that what China seeks is to create an “ethnic-based empire and tout the racial superiority of their race over all others.” China’s crackdowns on the Uighurs, Tibetans, and other minorities clearly corroborate this argument. Yet no neighboring states, never mind Western states, would buy into Chinese legalist ideology if all it offered was submission to the Han people. Being a loyal Marxist is more important to Xi’s cabal than being loyal to the Han ethnicity, allowing for greater marketability of this ideology.

Nor was legalism ever about class struggle – it is, as Mosher argues, about achieving a total uniformity in society of thought and action. It is clear from the structure of Xi’s regime, as well as from his own elite education and that of his daughter, that Xi does want a society with classes: the elite class that he and his friends belongs to, and everybody else. This is the classic Marxist societal structure, where all wealth lands in the hands of the oligarchy while the masses starve.

This is not to say that the legalist emperors did not live lavishly while many people starved, but the wellbeing of each individual was directly tied to the emperor’s whim, not part of any organized system. The language of creating a “moderately prosperous China” Xi used during the CPC Congress this year could not be possible without Marxism, and wooing Western authoritarians in 2017 is impossible without a preoccupation with class.

Mosher clearly concludes that a clash of civilizations between America and China is inevitable. “There is no room in either country’s conception of the future global order for the other,” he writes.

Yet as dire as this seems, time and again Mosher offers hope by highlighting the Chinese people’s own resistance to authoritarianism. The Chinese – like everyone else – reject being stripped of their humanity. They ultimately felled the Qin dynasty, established the Republic of China in rejection of communism, have embraced Christianity by the tens of millions, and continue to struggle against the regime through human rights lawsuits and global advocacy. From Tiananmen to Tibet to the Uighurs of Xinjiang and the Hong Kong millennials fighting against “One Country, Two Systems,” the fact that the odds are against them have not subdued Chinese individualists.

This is a problem that the United States does not share. Americans, with the exception of a tiny minority of Marxist “intellectuals,” accept the superiority of limited government individualism and use their freedom to make the most of themselves. There are no organized uprisings against America’s constitution, even as protests against politicians occur daily. Americans embrace American values whether they hold public office or not.

Millions of Chinese people reject what Xi is selling as “Chinese values.” Even in the implicit dire warning Mosher offers that Chinese authoritarianism is almost as old as humanity itself, the resilience of opposition to that authoritarianism is a beacon of hope.

John Carney and Frances Martel,China has a plan for your future and it's called One Belt One Road.,2017-11-23T06:00:47Z,breitbart-news,6 Things You Should Know About China's One Belt One Road Plan,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/11/23/x-things-you-should-know-about-chinas-one-belt-one-road-plan/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/beijing-china-xi-jinping-chinese-government-getty-photo.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"China has a plan for your future and it’s called One Belt One Road.

China’s One Belt One Road (OBOR) project – consisting of the Silk Road Economic Belt, a land route to Europe, and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, a sea route cutting from the Philippines to the Mediterranean – is a sprawling bureaucratic monstrosity the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) asserts will create a better-connected, wealthier global economy. The Belt and Road Initiative, as it is sometimes also called, requires China to invest heavily in infrastructure and development across three continents to facilitate trade for China.

advertisement

Below, a map of the land and sea routes President Xi Jinping hopes China will control at the end of the project (via Chinese state outlet China Daily).

The consistent injection of all this terminology – the belt, the road, the “ancient” allusions – into trade discussions involving China have left many in America with questions. Where the road ends, what the world looks like once China is done building its infrastructure, and what checks remain on Chinese hegemony of OBOR succeeds are all valid questions that China has yet to definitively answer.

From what China has revealed of its plan, however, One Belt One Road could significantly altar the geopolitical and economic landscapes of Asia, Europe, and Africa, in at least the following X ways.

One Belt One Road Is Mercantilism on a Global Scale

One Belt One Road is China’s plan to dominate world trade by building and controlling a network of roads, pipelines, railways, ports, and power plants to deliver raw materials to China and finished goods to the rest of the world. It’s a super-highway for Chinese economic dominance.

The long-term goal of OBOR is pretty straightforward. China wants to be the world’s dominant manufacturer in the 21st Century. It wants everything you buy in a store or online to be made, in part or in whole, in China, with Chinese labor, and for the profit of Chinese businesses. It understands that, in order to accomplish this goal, it is not enough for China to merely underprice businesses in Europe and the U.S. It must control not only the means of production but the means of delivery: the roads, ports, railways, and pipelines.

Control over the means of delivery has been a long-term Chinese goal. China already controls the majority of ports around the Panama Canal, the key to shipping between the Pacific Rim and Atlantic facing Europe. OBOR would create another route to Europe’s consumers, through central Asia.

The ultimate goal is to allow China to control the terms of global trade, rending aging Western-dominated institutions and practices dispensible. It is nothing short of reshaping the global economic order around the priorities of China’s leaders.

It’s a Bailout for China’s Economy

Economic growth has been slowing within China for years, putting more and more pressure on China’s government-controlled financial sector to fund projects that are increasingly uneconomical. The country is producing far more steel, cement, and machinery than it can possibly use. So China has built cities in which no one lives, office towers in which no one works, and roads that literally go nowhere in an effort to keep its population employed.

The massive infrastructure projects of OBOR are an extension of this. They provide the short-term demand for China’s production, staving off what many thought would be an inevitable economic reckoning and collapse.

Turning Everyone Chinese

Here’s a propaganda video produced by the Chinese government to promote “understanding” of OBOR. Notice that at the start of the video, the cute kids are all Chinese. As it progresses, the kids morph into south Asians, middle easterners and finally into blond Europeans. If you really want to understand what China is up to with OBOR, this video is the clearest indication.

It Could Significantly Hurt India

As the China Daily map shows, India is in a pivotal geographic location for the Silk Road Economic Belt – any major development to get to either Africa (through the Indian Ocean) or central Asia requires India’s input. The potential of a robust Chinese presence on the China-India border or in Pakistan, and a similar such presence in the Indian Ocean, has alarmed the Indian government, China’s main economic rival on the continent.

China’s construction of roads near the border already caused a major diplomatic dispute this summer. The Chinese attempted to extend a road construction into neighboring Bhutan against that government’s wishes, triggering Bhutan to call for India to intervene. India sent troops into the disputed territory, which China claims as its own, and forced China to withdraw its road construction project.

Outside of Bhutan, China is seeking to build the new Silk Road straight through Kashmir, a disputed territory between India and Pakistan. China is a close ally of Pakistan, which the Indian government often accuses of harboring jihadist terrorism. The Kashmir project is called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and its completion could give Pakistan (and, of course, China) full control of the territory. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has denied that CPEC involves any “territorial disputes” despite its location, while Chinese officials have accused India of seeing China as an “imaginary enemy.”

India and its allies in the United States have rejected this claim. Speaking following a trip to India, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told reporters that China must understand that, “in a globalized world, there are many belts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of dictating ‘one belt, one road.'”

He added that the project “goes through disputed territory … [and] that in itself shows the vulnerability of trying to establish that sort of a dictate.”

India has protested less about the maritime trade routes China is establishing, as Beijing has yet to violate India’s waters. Yet analysts note that “China now has India surrounded, wrapped up by land and sea via its Belt and Road initiative (BRI),” and the Indian government appears to be acting with this in mind, abstaining from participating in major OBOR summits and instead growing closer to Washington.

Much of the ‘Maritime Silk Road’ Is Illegal

Xinhua, a Chinese state news outlet, describes the Maritime Silk Road as heading “from China’s coast to Europe through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean in one route, and from China’s coast through the South China Sea to the South Pacific in the other.” What Xinhua leaves out of this statement is that China claims almost the entire South China Sea for itself – a claim the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague deems illegal.

China claims waters in the South China Sea within the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Taiwan, and the waters off of Natuna Island, Indonesia. This includes the Spratly and Paracel Islands, which belong to Vietnam and the Philippines, where China has spent the past three years constructing artificial islands and arming them to the teeth with military assets like fighter jets, advanced surveillance systems, and surface-to-air missiles.

China openly asserts that the Paracel Islands, known in China as the Xisha Islands, are part of OBOR.

“The Xisha Islands will soon be offered to more cruise passengers following the popularity of the Coconut Princess cruise liner’s new 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road route to the archipelago,” the Chinese government announced in 2015. “The cruise has been rerouted and, since Feb 7, re-branded as a Maritime Silk Road excursion, because more cruise companies are hopping aboard the concept of creating modern tours along the ancient sea routes.”

In 2016, the Hague court issued a verdict in Philippines v. China against the defendant, stating that all its construction in the disputed territories violates international law, as well as its actions against foreign vessels in international waters. Chinese officials announced they would ignore the Hague ruling and continue construction in the area. They have also increased the number of Chinese ships active in Philippine and other foreign waters, intended to intimidate fishermen attempting to use their domestic waters.

OBOR Is China’s Manifest Destiny

As The Diplomat has noted, the territory covered by OBOR “includes more than two thirds of world population and more than one third of global economic output, and could involve Chinese investments that total up to $4 trillion.” This includes the aforementioned South China Sea waters that no one outside of the Beijing elite argues rightfully belong under Chinese control. It includes territories like Nepal, Afghanistan, and central Asian states that at one point or another in history were closely tied to some part of China.

OBOR is designed to reconstruct an alleged “ancient” Chinese empire through infrastructure, trade, and culture. Chinese officials are quick to use the word “ancient” to describe both their claims in the South China Sea and the precedent for OBOR.

“For thousands of years, the Silk Road Spirit … has been passed from generation to generation, promoted the progress of human civilization, and contributed greatly to the prosperity and development of the countries along the Silk Road,” the state outlet Xinhua argued in 2015, introducing the specifics of the project. Of the South China Sea, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last year that “the islands in the South China Sea have been China’s territory since ancient times, and China has the right to safeguard its territorial sovereignty.”

Xi Jinping himself has said that the entire South China Sea was “left to us by our ancestors.”

On land, China has not made such sweeping claims. But its OBOR plans make clear it hopes to make the communities it touches more Chinese. The Chinese government announced in 2015 its plans to build at least 50 Chinese “cultural centers” across the “ancient Silk Road” meant to expand Chinese cultural influence. The targets of these centers will be as close as Nepal and as far as Turkey.

China will also be opening schools across the region. “More than 10 countries involved have expressed an interest in China running schools or education programs on their territory,” the government claimed in announcing OBOR last year. Countries in the Middle East and South Asia reportedly expressed interest in these schools.

If they are anything like the schools in China, they will indoctrinate children in communist thought, the greatness of Xi Jinping, and the illegal claims China makes in the waters surrounding it.","chinapakistan economic corridor cpec

Michael Patrick Leahy,"Norman Rockwell's ""Thanksgiving Picture"" is one of the most iconic images ever created of American life.",2017-11-23T06:00:16Z,breitbart-news,The Story Behind Norman Rockwell's 'Thanksgiving Picture',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/23/the-story-behind-norman-rockwells-thanksgiving-picture/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/Freedom_From_Want-Norman-Rockwell-U.S.-National-Archives-and-Records-Administration.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Norman Rockwell’s “Thanksgiving Picture” is one of the most iconic images ever created of American life.

First published in the March 6, 1943 weekly edition of The Saturday Evening Post, Rockwell worried that the presentation of such a large turkey at the center of the bountiful and happy feast back home might cause unhappiness among the American troops fighting in Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific at a time when the tide of the war had not yet turned. It was still more than a year before the successful D-Day invasion on the beaches of Normandy June 6, 1944.

advertisement

Among the troops, the reaction was largely the opposite of what Rockwell feared.

In fact, the alternate name given the picture, “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” bespoke the optimism it engendered among American soldiers and sailors serving in far off lands. It offered them a reminder of what they were fighting for, and gave them a future to which they sought to return.

How the picture has come to be seen over time has obscured some of the controversy that surrounded its creation.

On January 6, 1941–a full 11 months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and America entering World War II–President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his most famous State of the Union address to Congress.

The address was labeled “The Four Freedoms Speech,” and in it Roosevelt outlined four freedoms he argued were the universal rights of everyone in the world, not just American citizens:

1. Freedom of speech

2. Freedom of worship

3. Freedom from want

4. Freedom from fear

Roosevelt had just been elected to an unprecedented third term as president and was looking for political support for the Lend-Lease bill he was about to introduce to Congress, whose purpose was to finance the construction of armaments and war material that could be shipped to Great Britain, which had been engaged in a deadly war of survival with Nazi Germany since the fall of 1939.

The first two freedoms — freedom of speech and freedom of worship — were not controversial at all, as they were embodied within the First Amendment of the Constitution.

The second two freedoms, however, included a crucial change in the preposition used — “of” became “from” — and asserted rights for everyone in the world that are not found in the Constitution — freedom from want and freedom from fear.

To New Dealers, the addition of these two new freedoms — scholars refer to them as “positive liberties” as opposed the more familiar Constitutional “negative liberties”– represented a logical extension of the social welfare state.

To conservative critics–then and now–the addition of these two positive liberties in Roosevelt’s assertion of universal rights represented a dangerous embrace of Statism and an abandonment of individual responsibility.

In the 1940s, The Saturday Evening Post, published weekly, was the most widely read and popular magazine in the United States. Norman Rockwell’s art had been a defining feature of the publication since his work first graced its cover in 1916. Over the next 50 years, Rockwell’s work was on the cover of the magazine 300 different times.

After the United States entered World War II in December, 1941, the management and owners of The Post felt it was paramount that the populace support the war effort, both politically and financially, despite their general opposition to Roosevelt’s New Deal.

To encourage that support, in 1942 they commissioned their star artist, Rockwell, to create four magazine covers that could communicate the meaning of President Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms, resonate with the American people, and bolster their support for the war effort.

Rockwell labored seven months to create the four iconic covers, which ran in four consecutive weeks of the Post’s editions published from February to March 1943.

Each cover was accompanied by an essay.

In the case of “Freedom from Want,” the essay was assigned to Carlos Bulosan, a Filipino-American immigrant and labor union organizer who presented a picture of America quite different from the bountiful happiness rendered by Rockwell, who used photographs of friends from the small town in which he lived, Arlington, Vermont, for the people who joyfully crowded around the Thanksgiving table.

“If you want to know what we are, look upon the farms or upon the hard pavements of the city. You usually see us working or waiting for work, and you think you know us, but our outward guise is more deceptive than our history,” Bulosan began, adding:

Our history has many strands of fear and hope that snarl and converge at several points in time and space. We clear the forest and the mountains of the land. We cross the river and the wind. We harness wild beast and living steel. We celebrate labor, wisdom, peace of the soul. When our crops are burned or plowed under, we are angry and confused. Sometimes we ask if this is the real America. Sometimes we watch our long shadows and doubt the future. But we have learned to emulate our ideals from these trials. We know there were men who came and stayed to build America. We know they came because there is something in America that they needed, and which needed them. We march on, though sometimes strange moods fill our children. Our march toward security and peace is the march of freedom—the freedom that we should like to become a living part of. It is the dignity of the individual to live in a society of free men, where the spirit of understanding and belief exists; of understanding that all men, whatever their color, race, religion or estate, should be given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities. But we are not really free unless we use what we produce. So long as the fruit of our labor is denied us, so long will want manifest itself in a world of slaves.

His essay ended as angrily as it began:

But our march to freedom is not complete unless want is annihilated. The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world. We are the mirror of what America is. If America wants us to be living and free, then we must be living and free. If we fail, then America fails. What do we want? We want complete security and peace. We want to share the promise and fruits of American life. We want to be free from fear and hunger. If you want to know what we are—We are Marching!

It remains a bit of a mystery why the Post’s management chose to include an essay so tightly aligned with the New Deal social welfare zealots they opposed so vehemently.

As for Rockwell, the man whose artistic genius captured the essence of traditional American values, his own political philosophy–described by some as independent, by others as a New Deal supporter, and still others as none of the above–what remains is the art, which grows more powerful with each passing year.

Bulosan died in obscurity in 1956. Rockwell lived amid fame and acclaim until 1978.

But the two different visions of America they presented to readers of the March 6, 1943 edition of The Saturday Evening Post are today even further apart than they were more than 74 years ago.

In March, The Norman Rockwell Museum “announced details of the first internationally touring exhibition devoted to Rockwell’s iconic depictions of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms,” in a press release:

Organized by the Museum, Enduring Ideals: Rockwell, Roosevelt & the Four Freedoms explores how Rockwell’s 1943 paintings—which gave visual voice to Roosevelt’s call to the defense of freedom worldwide—came to be embraced by millions of Americans, providing crucial aid to the War effort and taking their place among the most enduring images in the history of American art. The exhibition and its six-city tour will open at New-York Historical Society on May 25, 2018.

The Norman Rockwell Museum is located in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and is open to the public seven days a week, year round.","filipinoamerican immigrant and labor union

Flynn's legal team told President Donald Trump's counsel that it could not discuss the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 US election, The New York Times reported.

Flynn's legal team was previously sharing information with Trump's counsel about the investigation.



The former national security adviser Michael Flynn may soon be cooperating or negotiating with prosecutors.

Flynn's legal team told President Donald Trump's counsel it could no longer discuss the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 US election, The New York Times reported Thursday.

Flynn's counsel had been disclosing information on Mueller's investigation, which has expanded to examine whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to tilt the election in Trump's favor, but had notified Trump's legal team that it would stop doing so, four sources involved in the case told The Times.

Withholding information from Trump's counsel does not necessarily mean Flynn is cooperating with Mueller's investigation, as attorneys sometimes do that when beginning to negotiate with prosecutors, The Times reported. Sharing information among defense lawyers during investigations is also common, though the defendant's counsel must stop when a conflict of interest is raised, the report said.

""This is not entirely unexpected,"" Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's attorneys, said in a Washington Post report Thursday. ""No one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president.""

Flynn previously told the FBI and investigators that he would submit to be interviewed in exchange for immunity from prosecution, according to officials cited in a Wall Street Journal report in March.

Robert Kelner, an attorney for Flynn, made the offer to the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees to avoid what he called ""unfair prosecution,"" the report said, adding that no officials accepted Flynn's terms at the time.

Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., are subjects in Mueller's widening investigation, and Mueller is said to have enough evidence to indict the two.

Mueller is believed to have shifted his focus to Flynn after a federal grand jury in October indicted Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, on various counts related to his work as a foreign agent and other financial crimes.","the times withholding information

Bob Bryan,Three new analyses of the Senate's Tax Cuts and...,2017-11-23T14:03:00Z,business-insider,The GOP tax plan got a triple whammy of brutal reviews,http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-tax-reform-bill-analysis-reviews-text-2017-11,http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5a15d05bf914c356018b5b78-1190-625/the-gop-tax-plan-got-a-triple-whammy-of-brutal-reviews.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Three new analyses of the Senate's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act all delivered bad news for Republican leaders.

The Tax Policy Center found that more than 50% of Americans would see a tax increase in 2027 under the bill.

Only one out of 42 economists surveyed by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business said the bill would increase economic growth substantially.

The Penn-Wharton Budget Model found that the bill would blow a hole in the federal deficit.



While Congress is on a weeklong Thanksgiving break, the breakneck speed of the Republican push to overhaul the US tax code has taken a bill close to passing in the Senate.

The latest version of the chamber's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed the Senate Finance Committee last Thursday, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wants to bring the bill for a full Senate vote when lawmakers return from the recess.

But on Tuesday, Republicans were hit with something of a triple whammy: Three different groups offered critical analyses of the bill's potentially negative effects on the federal budget, Americans' taxes, and the broader US economy. While the Senate is still expected to make changes to the legislation, each of the new studies shows that the Senate's bill has some significant underlying problems.

Tax Policy Center says it would raise taxes on half of Americans

Perhaps the most damning of the new reports came from the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution's Tax Policy Center.

The nonpartisan group's analysis of the legislation found that while all income groups would get a tax cut from the bill in the short term and long term, many Americans would see their taxes increase. From the report:

In 2019: Americans, on average, would see their taxes cut by $1,300, an increase in take-home pay of 1.7%. Americans in the middle quintile of income earners — $50,000 to $87,000 a year — would get a tax cut of $850, on average, and receive 18.4% of the tax cuts' benefits. People in the top 1% of incomes, more than $750,000 a year, would see a cut of $34,130, on average, and receive 17.6% of the bill's total benefit.

Americans, on average, would see their taxes cut by $1,300, an increase in take-home pay of 1.7%. Americans in the middle quintile of income earners — $50,000 to $87,000 a year — would get a tax cut of $850, on average, and receive 18.4% of the tax cuts' benefits. People in the top 1% of incomes, more than $750,000 a year, would see a cut of $34,130, on average, and receive 17.6% of the bill's total benefit. In 2027: The bill's proposed sunset of the individual tax cuts, combined with other changes to the code, means benefits would be substantially less for the middle class. The average cut for all Americans would be just $300, and 50.3% of American households would actually see their taxes increase by this point. Those in the middle quintile of earners would see a tax cut of just $50, on average, and 65.6% of these people would see their taxes go up. People in the top 1% of income earners, however, would still get a tax cut of $32,510, on average, and would receive 61.8% of the total tax benefits from the plan. Just 16.8% of people in the top 1% would see a tax increase.

Economists do not think the bill will grow the economy

Trump and Republicans have argued that the cuts in the plan would stimulate economic growth and even help ""pay for"" its new spending. Most economists aren't buying the rosy projections.

But according to the IGM Forum survey of 42 academic economists by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, only one economist agreed that ""US GDP will be substantially higher a decade from now"" than under the current baseline. In fact, 52% disagreed or strongly disagreed that the bill would lead to significant economic growth, and 36% were uncertain.

And when asked whether the ""US debt-to-GDP ratio will be substantially higher"" in 10 years under the bill compared with current law, 88% of the economists agreed or strongly agreed, 2% were uncertain, and the rest abstained.

Penn-Wharton budget model says the bill would blow a hole in the deficit

The final rough analysis for the legislation came from a new report from the University of Pennsylvania, using its Penn-Wharton Budget Model to assess the budgetary effects of the bill.

While Trump administration officials say the legislation would pay for itself, some Senate Republicans have been hesitant to support the bill over concerns that it would cause a massive increase in the federal debt.

The Penn model found that the bill would increase the federal deficit by $1.327 trillion over the first 10 years after it becomes law (not including debt-service costs). Even when factoring in the economic boost from the tax cuts, according to the report, the bill would still add $1.271 trillion in debt.

Either way, the model concludes that much like the House version of the bill, the Senate bill would not come close to paying for itself.","university of chicagos booth school of business

This year, Black Friday spending was spread out through November with most sales starting Thanksgiving morning.

Mobile spending is drastically up on Thanksgiving, making Black Friday more of a season than a one-day event.



November 24 is only one day, but Black Friday's season is a lot longer than that.

Bargains at America's largest retailers all started on Thanksgiving, with deals online starting Thanksgiving morning. The deals are still labeled as Black Friday, but they start at least a half a day before November 24.

The move seems to be paying off for retailers. Spending online Thanksgiving was up 29% this year compared to last year, according to data from Salesforce. In 2016, Thanksgiving online sales only increased 17% over 2015, suggesting the rate of the holiday turning into a shopping event is quickening.

Data from Adobe as of Friday showed online sales at retailers on Thanksgiving day at nearly $2.9 billion. The average online order is also up more than 3% on Thanksgiving, Adobe says

Phones have understandably driven the growth of sales on Thanksgiving, counting for 46% of all retailer traffic according to Adobe — an increase of more than 15% over last year. At the same time, traffic decreased from both tablets and desktops, making mobile the most popular option for Thanksgiving shopping for the first time ever.

It's likely due to a combination of a proliferation of shopping apps and the ease of using a phone to sneak some holiday shopping while at a relative's house waiting for turkey.

Thanksgiving is now edging out the rest of the Black Friday weekend, making it the third biggest shopping day of the year according to Salesforce.

But it isn't just Thanksgiving that is leading to Black Friday's demise. Online sales from November 1 through 22 totaled almost $30.4 billion this year, counting for nearly 18% year over year growth according to Adobe.

Every single day in November so far saw over $1 billion in online sales, creating a new paradigm for both shoppers and retailers. Black Friday isn't just a day anymore — it's a whole season.","thanksgiving

Gene Kim and Jessica Orwig,Renowned physicist Brian Greene explains how time can be manipulated with wormholes.,2017-11-21T00:00:00Z,business-insider,There are 2 types of time travel and physicists agree that one of them is possible,http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-time-travel-with-wormholes-2017-11,http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5a0f72913dbef41e008b6ee1-1190-625/there-are-2-types-of-time-travel-and-physicists-agree-that-one-of-them-is-possible.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival, explains what we know about time travel so far. Following is a transcript of the video.

Brian Greene: I’m Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.

It's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.

We know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It’s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.

He also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity — a neutron star, a black hole — and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.

This is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel — to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.

The main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really … Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.

It's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole — put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey — then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel — through this wormhole — you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.

Now again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.","columbia university

Trump cited progress about ISIS and the Coast Guard's response to several hurricanes this year.

Trump bragged about the F-35 stealth fighter jet and cautioned that US allies can turn on America.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump thanked U.S. troops for their service on Thursday, assuring them ""we're really winning"" against America's foes as he celebrated Thanksgiving at his private club in Florida and provided lunch for Coast Guard men and women on duty for the holiday.

Using the occasion to pat himself on the back, Trump told deployed military members via a video conference that they've achieved more progress in Afghanistan and against the Islamic State group under his watch than had been made in years of the previous administration.

""Everybody's talking about the progress you've made in the last few months since I opened it up,"" he told the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division, whose members are conducting operations in Kandahar, Afghanistan. ""We're being talked about again as an armed forces — we're really winning.""

Speaking from a gilded room at his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump said: ""We're not fighting anymore to just walk around, we're fighting to win, and you people are really, you've turned it around over the last three to four months like nobody's seen, and they are talking about it, so thank you very much.""

Turning to the 74th Expeditionary Fighters Squadron based at the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, Trump suggested the Obama administration hadn't allowed soldiers on the ground to do their jobs.

""They say we've made more progress against ISIS than they did in years of the previous administration,"" he said. ""And that's because I'm letting you do your job.""

Throughout the day — at events and on Twitter — Trump boasted about the economy's performance since he took office, pointing to recent stock market gains and the unemployment rate, along with his efforts to scale back regulations and boost military spending.

""So you're fighting for something real, you're fighting for something good,"" he told the service members

Trump and his wife, Melania, also made a trip to a nearby Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach, Florida, where they delivered a lunch of turkey sandwiches, giant muffins, heaping baskets of fruit, chips and cookies to men and women on duty for the holidays.

During his remarks, Trump, singled out the service for its hurricane relief efforts during Harvey and the other storms that battered the country earlier this year.

""There's no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard,"" Trump told them ""What a job you've done.""

Trump praised the superiority of U.S. military equipment, too, yet said he tries to make sure that equipment the U.S. sells abroad — even to allies — is not quite as good as that kept at home.

""I always say, make ours a little bit better,"" Trump said. ""Keep about 10 percent in the bag."" He added: ""You never know about an ally. An ally can turn.""

Among the equipment admired by Trump is the F-35 stealth fighter jet, which he recalled asking ""Air Force guys"" about once.

""In a fight, you know a fight like I watch on the movies ... how good is it?"" he recalled asking. ""They said, 'Well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it, even if it's right next to it,'"" Trump recounted, prompting laughs.

The F-35, plagued by development problems and cost overruns, is in fact not invisible to people nearby. Its stealth technology is designed to evade detection by radar and other sensors.

At the earlier video conference, Trump cleared the room of press after about 10 minutes so he could have ""very confidential, personal conversations"" with those on the line. Borrowing a line from his ""Apprentice"" days, he told the reporters ""You're fired,"" then wished them a happy Thanksgiving, too.

On the Trumps' own Thanksgiving menu for family and friends at Mar-a-Lago: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, red snapper, Florida stone crab, baked goods, local produce and cheeses, and a selection of cakes and pies for dessert.","video conference trump

WalletHub.com calculated this number based on an average of discounts it evaluated for its Black Friday report.

It might still be worth buying an item if it rarely goes on sale or is otherwise hard to find.

Almost every retailer offers big discounts on Black Friday. But how can you be sure that that discount isn't just a bait and switch?

This year, the most important number in Black Friday shopping is 37%.

That's the threshold for a good deal, according to analysis by the personal finance website WalletHub, which took an average of all the discounts being offered by the 35 largest retailers participating in Black Friday.

Some retailers offer doorbuster discounts in limited quantities to lure customers into the store, but then only offer small discounts on other merchandise. Sticking to the 37% discount figure, which can easily be calculated on the fly, will ensure you won't be tricked by misleading Black Friday deals.

This number isn't universal, though. The 37% figure is an average of all categories, but some categories, like appliances or computers, typically offer a smaller discount. And, if you're looking for an item that rarely goes on sale or is hard to find, it might still be worth snagging the Black Friday discount even if it's less than 37%.

Still, it's a good rule of thumb to remember as you shop online or roam the aisles on November 24.","personal finance website wallethub

Joe Ciolli,Hedge funds are neglecting to protect against...,2017-11-23T18:51:00Z,business-insider,Hedge funds have run out of ideas and stopped living up to their name,http://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-funds-chasing-tech-gains-not-protecting-downside-2017-11,http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5a15b2def914c356018b5ab5-1190-625/hedge-funds-have-run-out-of-ideas-and-stopped-living-up-to-their-name.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Hedge funds are neglecting to protect against the downside in stocks, with one hedging gauge sitting close to the lowest in five years.

These funds are also seeing a near-record concentration in a small group of outperforming tech stocks, showing a lack of diversification.

The top five stock holdings among hedge funds right now are FacebookAmazon, AlibabaAlphabet and Microsoft, according to Goldman Sachs.

At the same time, funds overall are faring worse than the S&P 500.



Hedge funds are supposed to offer a level of hands-on investment prowess that can't be found anywhere else. That's, theoretically, why they command higher fees for their services than traditional money managers.

But recent data from Goldman Sachs suggests that hedge funds are failing to differentiate themselves, and also neglecting their namesake characteristic: hedging.

Short interest — a measure of bets that a stock will fall, and often used as a hedging proxy — makes up roughly 2% of S&P 500 market cap. That's close to the lowest level in five years, according to data compiled by Goldman.

To further drive home the unabashed confidence being displayed by hedge funds, Goldman finds that they added net leverage heading into the fourth quarter.



Funds now carry a net long exposure of 51%, above the historical average and the most since 2015, the firm's data shows.

It's the red-hot performance of tech stocks that has them particularly excited. And while hedge funds have made money hitching their wagon to the sector, they're not doing much else to encourage clients to continue forking over lofty fees.

The top five stock holdings in hedge funds right now are Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Alphabet and Microsoft, according to Goldman study of 804 funds with $2.1 trillion under management. These stocks headline the firm's so-called ""VIP list,"" which has outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 by nearly eight percentage points in 2017.

Unfortunately, however, the average long/short equity hedge fund has posted a return of just 10% this year, trailing the 16% gain for the S&P 500. That suggests that these funds are struggling to pick winners outside of tech.

It might explain why they've become so reliant on the sector, and are going against another key tenet of hedge fund investing: diversification. The average hedge fund carries 68% of its long portfolio in its top 10 positions, which is just below a record high reached in early 2016. Further, the largest fund positions saw turnover of just 13% last quarter.

With all of that considered, the question must be raised: Why should you pay a hedge fund a hefty fee for market-trailing returns and undiversified holdings?

Some high-profile hedge fund managers don't know what to do

These struggles are not lost on some of the most high-profile members of the hedge fund community.

Tourbillon Capital, which manages $3.4 billion and is run by Jason Karp, published a soul-searching investor letter in August that outlined many of the struggles facing hedge funders today. A big part of his argument centered around the meteoric rise of passive investing, which he says makes active management far more difficult. His points echo a common criticism of passive trading — that it homogenizes the market and causes the type of crowding that makes it tough to beat benchmarks.

Karp has also railed against what he sees as ""frothy speculation"" leading to the huge influx of capital into positions such as going long tech. And it doesn't yet appear as if he's figured it out. His firm's flagship Global Master fund is down 10.6% in 2017, according to a recent note seen by Business Insider.

Meanwhile, Greenlight Capital founder David Einhorn has adopted a contrarian view on many of the most popular tech stocks, with limited success so far. He sees Amazon, Tesla and Netflix in particular as stretched, calling them ""bubble shorts,"" and has openly wondered if the market has started using an ""alternative paradigm"" for calculating equity value.

Einhorn's funds have gained just 3.3% on a year-to-date basis, but actually beat the S&P 500 by almost three percentage points in the third quarter, suggesting that perhaps not all hope is gone.

What can hedge funds do?

Of course, it's always possible that tech stocks will experience a reckoning of sorts — a type of market event that slashes valuations in the sector and sends traders scrambling. It's something that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has warned against for months, citing overstretched sentiment and trader euphoria.

If that were to happen, it would give hedge fund managers a fresh chance to prove their bonafides with the investment herd dispersed.



The question is: How many of them can hang on for that long?","hedge fund community tourbillon

Natasha Bertrand,The Trump Organization will end its contract...,2017-11-23T18:42:36Z,business-insider,The Trump Organization is set to distance itself from one of its biggest headaches in the Russia probe,http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11,http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5a1712c73dbef4ae448b7aad-1190-625/the-trump-organization-is-set-to-distance-itself-from-one-of-its-biggest-headaches-in-the-russia-probe.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The Trump Organization will end its contract with the real estate investment firm that owns the Trump SoHo hotel in New York, effectively ending Trump's relationship with the troubled hotel.

In walking away early from the deal, the Trump Organization will also distance itself from the controversial firm it worked with nearly a decade ago to develop the troubled hotel: Bayrock.

Bayrock and its cofounder, Felix Sater, are now under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Trump's business dealings as part of his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow during the 2016 election.

The Trump Organization will cut ties with New York's Trump SoHo Hotel after years of financial hardship and even boycotts following Donald Trump's presidential run and electoral victory in November.

In walking away early from the licensing deal it struck with the California-based real estate investment firm CIM Group, which owns Trump SoHo, the Trump Organization will also distance itself from the controversial firm it worked with nearly a decade ago to develop the troubled hotel: Bayrock.

Trump worked with Bayrock on at least four projects throughout the 2000's, including the Trump SoHo. Some of those projects ultimately failed. Bayrock was co-founded by the Russian-born businessman Felix Sater, who was accused nearly two decades ago of being a co-conspirator in a $40 million fraud and money-laundering scheme involving four Mafia families.

A lawsuit brought in 2010 against Sater and others, which is ongoing, alleges that ""for most of its existence [Bayrock] was substantially and covertly mob-owned and operated,"" engaging ""in a pattern of continuous, related crimes, including mail, wire, and bank fraud; tax evasion; money laundering; conspiracy; bribery; extortion; and embezzlement.""

The lawsuit, filed by Bayrock's former finance director, Jody Kriss, accused Sater and Bayrock's founder, Tevfik Arif, of cheating him out of millions of dollars via fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, among other misconduct. In December, a New York judge ruled that the lawsuit could move forward as a racketeering case.

Sater and Bayrock are now under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Trump's business dealings as part of his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow during the 2016 election. Mueller is probing whether Russia ever held any financial leverage over Trump that was, or could be, used as blackmail.

'It's ridiculous that I wouldn't be investing in Russia'

According to Kriss' complaint, Sater and Arif began negotiating with the Trump Organization in 2003 to market certain projects under the Trump brand but didn't tell Trump about Sater's criminal past.

In a 2007 deposition, Trump said his organization would never have agreed to partner with Bayrock on the development of Trump SoHo had he known about Sater's past. Trump also said he would not be able to identify Sater if they were in the same room.

But Bayrock's office was once two floors below Trump's in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. A person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution by Sater or his associates, told Business Insider that Sater and Trump had standing meetings each week.

Sater has said in a deposition that he met with Trump ""on a constant basis,"" Bloomberg previously reported, and Kriss told the publication that Trump valued Sater's loyalty — and his Russia connections.

""It's ridiculous that I wouldn't be investing in Russia,"" Trump said in the 2007 deposition. ""Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment.""

Sater was evidently still in touch with Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as recently as late January.

The two met at a New York hotel on January 27 to discuss a peace plan for Russia and Ukraine that was drafted by a Ukrainian politician, Andrey Artemenko. Cohen was said to have delivered the plan directly to Michael Flynn before he resigned as national security adviser on February 13, though Cohen has disputed that in subsequent interviews.

'I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected'

Sater came back into the news over the summer when emails surfaced showing that he had been pushing for the Trump Organization to pursue a massive real-estate deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential election.

Emails exchanged between Sater and Cohen — who have known each other since they were teenagers — in November 2015 indicate that they were preparing to celebrate not only Trump's election victory, but also the potential Russia deal. The Trump Organization, which employed Cohen at the time, had signed a letter of intent to pursue the deal.

Sater boasted of his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the emails, which were obtained by The New York Times, telling Cohen that he would ""get all of Putins team to buy in"" on the Moscow deal.

""Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,"" Sater wrote. ""I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.""

Two months later, Cohen emailed Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, asking for his ""assistance"" in pushing the deal through, according to emails submitted to congressional investigators and read to The Washington Post.

""Over the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower - Moscow project in Moscow City,"" Cohen wrote Peskov. ""Without getting into lengthy specifics the communication between our two sides has stalled...As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance.""

Cohen sent the email to a generic Kremlin email address that was not Peskov's. The Kremlin said later that it had received the email, but Cohen told The Post that he never heard back — and that the deal was scrapped by late January 2016.

Sater was spotted at Trump Tower about six months after the deal collapsed. He told Politico at the time that the purpose of his visit was ""confidential."" But his presence there seven months after the Moscow real-estate deal fell through, and less than three months before Election Day, raised questions about who in Trump's orbit he was still in touch with — and why.

Sater showed Ivanka Trump and her brother Donald Trump Jr. around Moscow in 2006 when their father was scouting real estate in Russia. They stayed for several days at the Hotel National Moscow opposite the Kremlin, according to The Times.

Sater also acted as a fixer to help the former Kazakh cabinet minister Viktor Khrapunov buy three apartments in Trump SoHo using shell companies, the Financial Times reported. The Kazakh government has alleged that Khrapunov stole those funds from the state.

Khrapunov's use of shell companies to buy Trump real estate was not unique — a USA Today investigation found that approximately 70% of buyers of Trump properties since June 2016 were limited-liability companies, compared with about 4% of buyers in the two years before.","trump soho using shell companies the financial times

David Choi,Following a North Korean soldier's defection to...,2017-11-24T01:01:08Z,business-insider,North Korea reportedly replaced its border guards after a soldier's dramatic defection,http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-defector-guards-trees-ditches-south-korea-2017-11,http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5a176a07f914c35a018b5d18-1190-625/north-korea-reportedly-replaced-its-border-guards-after-a-soldiers-dramatic-defection.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Following a North Korean soldier's defection last week, the country has reportedly replaced all its border-security guards.

North Koreans were also spotted planted trees and digging a trench where the defector made his escape to South Korea, a top US diplomat said.



Following the dramatic defection of a soldier last week, North Korea has replaced all its border-security guards, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Thursday, citing an intelligence source.

""Signs were detected that North Korea has replaced all border-security officials following the defection,"" the intelligence source said in the report. ""Given this situation, commanders of the responsible military unit and senior officers might have undergone punishment.""

North Korea frequently punishes those who draw ire from its leaders, particularly Kim Jong Un, and is rumored to hand down strict sentences or use over-the-top methods to execute them.

The intelligence source said it appeared that North Korea had temporarily closed the bridge the defector used to make his escape.

North Korean forces were also seen planting two trees and digging a trench at the path the defector used, according to a top US diplomat in South Korea.

On November 13, the defecting soldier — identified by his family name, Oh, and believed to be 24 — started driving quickly toward the Military Demarcation Line, the line dividing North and South Korea. The vehicle's wheel reportedly came loose, and the defector ran on foot after running into an obstruction.

Footage from cameras shows several frantic North Korean soldiers firing their weapons at the defector, who was shot at least five times and eventually rescued by South Korean forces. South Korean doctors have said he is in stable condition and recovering steadily.","bordersecurity

For many, it is also a day to rush out and get some more.

Even before the turkey was on the table, shoppers across America lined up and rolled into stores the night before Black Friday.

""Unemployment has dropped, so people are really thinking that folks are going to head to the stores and head online this season,"" said Charisse Jones, a business reporter for USA Today. ""They're thinking sales will be up about 6 percent and $1.4 trillion will be spent by consumers.""

Online juggernaut Amazon is expected to take half of the holiday season sales growth.

CBS News

""When we go online and deal with a retailer there, they know every detail about our past order history, they know the things that we like, they know the things we don't like,"" said Lee Holman, the lead retail analyst with the IHL Group. ""The reality is brick-and-mortar retail is still the dominant part of retail.""

But retailers are feeling the online pressure. Holman said some big-box stores are changing their approach, opening smaller venues and catering to shoppers in urban areas.

""There are retailers planning smaller stores that are maybe a little bit more intimate. So that the communication between the store associate and the customer can be enhanced,"" Holman said.

Target is planning to open 130 smaller format stores by the end of 2019, like the one they have in heart of Manhattan's shopping district.

The vast majority of shoppers may miss out on those door buster dealers, but retailers know that consumers won't leave empty-handed. That means more dollars spent to boost the holiday bottom line.","thanksgiving

The ad appeared at the top of search results for an unknown number of users for at least part of the day Thursday:

CBS News

When contacted by CBS News, Google said the ad violated its policies and was removed. It's unknown what proportion of users searching for ""Amazon"" were shown the ad.

""This was an abuse of our platform. We strictly prohibit advertising of illegal activity and have removed these ads and suspended the account,"" a Google representative said.

While the ad appeared to be a link to Amazon, users who clicked it were instead redirected briefly to a URL of an app running on a Facebook page, CBS affiliate WHP discovered. The redirect could be used to bypass Google's automated scam detection tools.

It's unclear how the app redirected users outside Facebook. The company could not immediately be reached for comment.

The app, which appeared to have been removed or shut down Thursday evening, then redirected users to a phony support site purporting to be run by Microsoft's support team with a message saying the computer was infected with malware. The site's URL indicates it is not affiliated with Microsoft:

CBS News

A phone call to the number on the site Thursday evening was answered by a man with what sounded like a South Asian accent who said his name was Robert. He asked for the error code found on the pop-up and said he would need to take remote access of the computer to resolve the issue. He said he worked for Microsoft in New York City, but refused to answer when asked where he lived in the city.

He quickly became agitated and hung up when asked whether the site was a scam operation designed to lure users into forking over money for supposed anti-malware software. In another call, a man answering phone said the supposed malware issue could be fixed for a ""one-time fee of $149.99.""

Online scammers often prey on unsuspecting users by convincing them to purchase software to remove nonexistent malware or viruses. In a July episode of Gimlet Media's ""Reply All"" podcast, host Alex Goldman uncovered a similar scam operated out of an office building in India that yielded millions of dollars in revenue per year. A 2016 survey commissioned by Microsoft found that 21 percent of Americans said they had been duped by a tech support scam.

Amazon is the most popular online shopping destination for U.S. consumers, 69 percent of whom are expected to shop in the next five days, according to a consumer survey.

Google, Facebook and Twitter have come under intense scrutiny over the use of their advertising platforms to spread misinformation or legally dubious material. Members of Congress from both parties have called on the platforms to improve their policing of advertising customers, especially after the intelligence community determined Russian-backed intelligence operatives deployed paid advertising to influence the 2016 presidential campaign. In October, Facebook said 10 million people had seen some 3,000 ads bought by the Russians.

""Look at the muscles on that guy. Can I beat him in an arm wrestling contest?"" Mr. Trump said at a U.S. Coast Guard station near his South Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, handing out turkey sandwiches with first lady Melania Trump.

But Mr. Trump wasted no time using the holiday to brag about his administration's accomplishments.

""The stock market on Friday hit the all-time high, the highest it's ever been. Ever. In your whole long life,"" Mr. Trump said.

On the first day of his Thanksgiving vacation, Mr. Trump also resumed a Twitter feud with LaVar Ball, the father of a UCLA basketball player. The elder ball had questioned how much credit the president should get for the release of his son, who was arrested with two teammates in China for stealing sunglasses.

The dispute caught the eye of Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent, who noted that the president ""regularly attacks high-profile African-Americans to feed supporters' belief that the system is rigged for minorities."" Mr. Trump replied:

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 23, 2017

The White House did not respond to a CBS News request for clarification.

Following his early morning tweets, Mr. Trump made his second visit in as many days to his local golf club, spending about four hours there. Thursday night, the first family will share a Thanksgiving meal together at the so-called ""winter White House.""","the

The C-2A Greyhound crashed on Nov. 22 into the ocean southeast of Okinawa, Japan. Eight sailors were rescued about 40 minutes after the crash and were transferred to USS Ronald Reagan for medical evaluation, the U.S. Navy said in a statement. They are all currently in good condition.

The U.S. Navy said the families of the three service members missing had been notified of their ""duty status whereabouts unknown (DUSTWUN)"" status as of early Thursday, CBS News correspondent David Martin reported Wednesday.

The Navy said Thursday that the sailors' names are being withheld until the completion of next of kin notifications.

The twin-propeller plane came down about 500 nautical miles southeast of Okinawa as it was bringing passengers and cargo from Japan to the aircraft carrier, the Navy said in a statement. The cause wasn't clear and the crash was being investigated, the Navy said.

The USS Ronald Reagan led the combined search and rescue efforts with Japanese navy, the U.S. Navy said in a statement. During the course of the two-day search, eight U.S. Navy and Japanese navy ships, three helicopter squadrons and maritime patrol aircraft covered nearly 1,000 square nautical miles in the search for the missing sailors, the U.S. Navy said.

The Nov. 16-26 joint exercise in waters off Okinawa has been described by the Navy as the ""premier training event"" between the U.S. and Japanese navies, designed to increase defensive readiness and interoperability in air and sea operations.

The Navy's Japan-based 7th Fleet has had two fatal accidents in Asian waters this year, leaving 17 sailors dead and prompting the removal of eight top Navy officers from their posts, including the 7th Fleet commander.

The USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker collided near Singapore in August, leaving 10 U.S. sailors dead. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided off Japan.

The Navy has concluded that the collisions were avoidable and resulted from widespread failures by the crews and commanders, who didn't quickly recognize and respond to unfolding emergencies. A Navy report recommended numerous changes to address the problems, ranging from improved training to increasing sleep and stress management for sailors.","interoperability

Blair Guild,President Trump's former national security adviser may now be cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation,2017-11-23T22:09:00+00:00,cbs-news,Michael Flynn may now be cooperating with Russia investigation,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-flynn-may-now-be-cooperating-with-russia-investigation/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/11/229f0478-5c3b-4744-8ea6-a35bfa0ce03f/cbsn-fusion-special-counsel-targets-michael-flynn-son-in-alleged-turkish-government-plot-thumbnail-1439017-640x360.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Michael Flynn's legal team recently informed President Trump's lawyers that they can no longer discuss special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation-- a move that indicates Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, may now be cooperating with the investigation into potential Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Trump campaign collusion with the Kremlin.

CBS confirmed via sources familiar with the situation that Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner called John Dowd on Wednesday night to inform him that no future communications could or would occur regarding Flynn.

Previously, Flynn's lawyers had openly shared information about the special counsel's investigation with the president's legal team. Now, according to four people involved in the case who remained anonymous as they are not allowed to comment publicly on the matter, Flynn's communications with Mr. Trump's legal team have been terminated, The New York Times first reported.

It is common for defense lawyers to share investigation information, but this practice becomes unethical once a conflict of interest presents itself.

While this change in communications does not prove that Flynn is cooperating with Mueller's prosecution, it has led the White House legal team to believe that Flynn has now at least begun working with the investigation. However, CBS News confirmed that Mr. Trump's personal legal team does not consider this development necessarily harmful or threatening to the president.

""It is probably a plea deal,"" Jay Sekulow told CBS News. ""That is the assumption. And if it is a plea that doesn't necessarily mean it has anything to do with the president. The Manafort indictment didn't have anything to do with the campaign or Trump.""

Trump's legal team has been expecting this development for weeks. They have been awaiting either an indictment of Flynn or his son, or a plea deal involving one of both.

Mr. Trump's lawyers speculate the charges could revolve around violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Alternatively, the charges could be connected to Flynn's advocacy for Turkish entities or his discussions with individuals linked to the Turkish government.

Flynn had a security clearance during Mr. Trump's campaign and the subsequent transition to the White House as a result of his service as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Former President Obama fired Flynn from that position in 2014, but he retained the clearance.

If legitimate, Flynn's cooperation with the prosecution would give the special counsel investigation insight into the Trump campaign's operations and the early days of Mr. Trump's presidency. Flynn's role within the White House was terminated just 23 days into the Trump presidency.

CBS News,North Korea has not said anything about the soldier's brazen escape but one expert says the defection could have been a setup by regime,2017-11-23T10:40:49+00:00,cbs-news,Doctors reveal North Korean defector's grim health,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-defector-dramatic-escape-health-reveals-countrys-conditions/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/23/94a220c0-1b54-4212-a1a6-5f03a2bff4e6/ctm-112317-nkdefector.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The North Korean regime of Kim Jong Un has not said anything about the dramatic escape of one of its soldiers, who ran across the border into South Korea.

Most North Korean defectors head north and cross the border into China. Trying to escape by crossing the heavily-armed border with South Korea is considered a suicide mission, but this soldier survived, and may now provide some valuable information, reports CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy.

We don't yet know the identity of the North Korean soldier who daringly drove his army jeep to the border and then ran for his life. His former comrades fired off 40 shots, hitting him at least five times.

South Korean trauma surgeon Lee Cook-Jong operated on the soldier and says he found dozens of parasitic worms in his digestive tract, as well as uncooked corn; a sign of malnutrition.

The soldier is 24 years old, but at just 5 feet 5 inches and weighing 132 pounds, he is significantly smaller than an average 18-year-old in South Korea. Doctors have reportedly diagnosed him with tuberculosis and hepatitis B.

Last April, CBS News visited North Korea as it staged one of its elaborate military parades. Many of the soldiers we saw looked more like children -- likely the result of a brutal famine in the North during the 1990s.

South Korean intelligence officials will now want to question the defector about his escape, hoping he may provide a glimpse into Kim Jong Un's reclusive regime and information about whether recent United Nations sanctions are taking a toll.

""He would be questioned to see how legitimately he might be a real defector or is this actually not the case,"" said Suki Kim, who worked undercover as a teacher in North Korea for six months and has written extensively about defectors. She thinks this kind of escape is so rare and over the top, it could have been a setup by North Korea. She believes the North might have orchestrated it to try and create an incident with South Korea, using the soldier as a pawn.

""If North Korea government staged this dramatic, great escape, that really reeks of a Hollywood film – which in some way would not be that surprising – I think one thing I have learned by following North Korea for a decade and living there is that almost everybody's a victim. They are just serving the 'great leader.'""","recent united nations

With new faces and old favorites in the lineup, the Americana extravaganza made its way through 2 ½ miles of Manhattan on a cold morning.

""The crowds are still the same, but there's a lot more police here. That's the age we live in,"" Paul Seyforth said as he attended the parade he'd watched since the 1950s.

""Not a lot's changed -- the balloons, the bands, the floats -- and that's the good thing,"" said Seyforth, 76, who'd flown in from Denver to spend his 50th wedding anniversary in New York and see this year's parade.

The televised parade was proceeding smoothly, though about midway through, a gust of wind on a largely calm day blew a candy-cane balloon into a tree branch, and it popped near the start of the route on Manhattan's Upper West Side. No one was injured.

Facebook / Colin Weaver

In 2005, one of the parade's signature giant balloons caught a gust, hit a Times Square lamppost and injured two people. The candy cane was smaller than the giant balloons.

Timothy McMillian and his wife, their 9-year-old daughter and his in-laws started staking out a spot along the route at 6:30 a.m. They'd come from Greensboro, North Carolina, to see in person the spectacle they'd watched on TV for years.

McMillian, a 45-year-old schoolteacher, booked a hotel months ago, but he started to have some concerns about security when a truck attack on a bike path near the World Trade Center killed eight people on Halloween.

""With the event being out in the open like this, we were concerned,"" he said. ""But we knew security would be ramped up today, and we have full confidence in the NYPD.""

Authorities say there is no confirmation of a credible threat to the parade, but they were taking no chances after both the truck attack and the October shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival.

New York Police Department officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors were circulating among the crowds, sharpshooters were on rooftops and sand-filled city sanitation trucks were poised as imposing barriers to traffic at every cross street. Officers also were escorting each of the giant balloons.

The mayor and police brass have repeatedly stressed that visitors shouldn't be deterred. And Bekki Grinnell certainly wasn't.

""When your kid from Alaska is marching in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, you come,"" said Grinnell, whose daughter was marching with the band from Colony High School in Palmer, Alaska. Grinnell said she wasn't worried about security because of the police presence: ""I think we're in a safe spot.""

EDUARDO MUNOZ / REUTERS

Other paradegoers also showed their appreciation for police: The NYPD marching band and a group of mounted officers got some of the biggest cheers from spectators lined up as many as 15 deep along barricades. Among other crowd favorites: the SpongeBob SquarePants balloon.

The 91st annual parade featured new balloons including Olaf from the Disney movie ""Frozen"" and Chase from the TV cartoon ""Paw Patrol"" will be among the new balloons Thursday, along with a new version of the Grinch of Dr. Seuss fame.

Smokey Robinson, The Roots, Flo Rida and Wyclef Jean were among the stars celebrating, along with performances from the casts of Broadway's ""Anastasia,"" ''Dear Evan Hansen"" and ""SpongeBob SquarePants."" The lineup included a dozen marching bands, as well as the high-kicking Radio City Music Hall Rockettes -- and, of course, Santa Claus.

""This is my favorite thing ever,"" musician Questlove told The Associated Press as he got ready to ride the Gibson Guitars float with his bandmates in The Roots and late-night host Jimmy Fallon of ""The Tonight Show,"" where The Roots are the house band. Questlove said being in the parade is ""probably my favorite perk"" of the job.

""To go from being a spectator to being up here, it's kinda cool,"" he said.

Added singer-songwriter Andy Grammer as he got on the Homewood Suites float: ""It's kind of like being at the center of Thanksgiving.""","highkicking radio city music hall rockettes

Joe Barton apologized to his constituents after the image from 2013 began to circulate,2017-11-23T14:56:07+00:00,cbs-news,"Congressman accepts police investigation, after nude of him photo emerges online",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-barton-congressman-accepts-police-investigation-nude-photo/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2010/06/17/78b31b14-a642-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/image6591856x.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Rep. Joe Barton said he has accepted a Capitol Police offer to launch an investigation, after a nude image of him emerged online Wednesday.

The Texas Republican apologized to his constituents Wednesday, after the image from 2013 began to circulate. Barton said he engaged in consensual sexual relationships when he was separated from his second wife before their 2015 divorce.

But some have pointed out Barton could be a victim of ""revenge porn,"" a prosecutable offense. ""Revenge porn"" — when sexually explicit photos are posted without a person's consent online — was outlawed in Texas in 2015. The Washington Post on Wednesday published a transcript of a conversation in which Barton appears to tell a woman to whom he had sent sexually explicit photos, images and video that he will make a report to Capitol Police if she exposed his actions.

""The Dallas Morning News has identified a potential crime against me and the transcript referenced in the Washington Post may be evidence,"" Barton said in a statement provided to CBS News. ""This woman admitted that we had a consensual relationship. When I ended that relationship, she threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation. As the transcript reflects, I offered to take the matter to the Capitol Hill Police to open an investigation. Today, the Capitol Police reached out to me and offered to launch an investigation and I have accepted. Because of the pending investigation, we will have no further comment.""

Barton swiftly apologized for the circulation of the image Wednesday, saying he is sorry for not using ""better judgment.""

""While separated from my second wife, prior to the divorce, I had sexual relationships with other mature adult women,"" Barton said in a statement to CBS News. ""Each was consensual. Those relationships have ended. I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down.""

Barton, who recently announced his reelection bid in 2018, was first elected to Congress in 1984. He has previously served as the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

CBS/AP,Sheriff Joe Lombardo says his department's forensics lab is working with the FBI to process all ballistics evidence,2017-11-23T19:19:58+00:00,cbs-news,"Las Vegas massacre gunman fired over 1,100 rounds, sheriff says",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/las-vegas-shooting-stephen-paddock-gunman-fired-over-1100-rounds-sheriff-says/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/10/03/e061a7cc-b1a3-42f4-8d66-5aef63fb703a/ap-17276618061392.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"LAS VEGAS -- The top lawman in Las Vegas says the gunman who killed dozens of people at a concert last month fired more than 1,100 rounds.

The newly released estimate from Sheriff Joe Lombardo offers more detail about the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Lombardo tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was aware of the previously unreported figure because his department's forensics lab is working with the FBI to process all ballistics evidence.

Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds more on Oct. 1 after he shattered windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the music festival below before killing himself.

Authorities have said they have not determined Paddock's motive or why he stopped shooting. Lombardo says authorities found about 4,000 unused rounds in the suite.

He said he is frustrated by the lack of progress in determining a motive. Lombardo said police continue to interview Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, most recently on Monday.","mandalay bay hotelcasino

The group's survey of more than 7,000 consumers found that Black Friday will still hold the title as busiest shopping day, with 70 percent of people planning to hit the stores then. Next in line is Cyber Monday, with 48 percent of people set to shop online for deals that day.

Looking to the eager and fearless bargain hunters, 20 percent of consumers, or 32 million people, plan to start shopping as early as Thursday, NRF found. Many retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target, J.C. Penney, Macy's and Best Buy are opening their doors on Thanksgiving this year.

""While the utility of the weekend will continue to draw shoppers into stores and online to efficiently and inexpensively check off their lists, we're also seeing consumers report tradition and the opportunity to partake in holiday cheer as reasons for shopping, too,"" Prosper principal analyst Pam Goodfellow said in a statement.

""By now, people know what sort of deals they can expect to see during the weekend and are budgeting for them accordingly, and in many cases expertly.""

Tucker Higgins,The New York Times reports that Michael Flynn's lawyers told lawyers for the president that they could no longer discuss the special counsel's probe.,2017-11-23T21:32:28Z,cnbc,"Flynn reportedly cut ties with Trump, indicating potential Mueller cooperation",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/23/flynn-reportedly-cuts-ties-with-trump-indicating-potential-mueller-cooperation.html,https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/02/16/104287355-RTSYJ9R.1910x1000.jpg,business,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Michael Flynn's lawyers recently told lawyers for President Donald Trump that they can no longer discuss special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, The New York Times reported Thursday, citing sources involved with the case.



The move, which has been confirmed by CNBC, could be a sign that Flynn, Trump's former national security advisor, is cooperating — or negotiating an agreement — with Mueller. The former FBI director's probe is investigating the Trump campaign, Russian meddling in the U.S. election last year and other related concerns.

The Times reported that the president's attorneys believe Flynn ""has, at the least, begun discussions"" with Mueller's investigators regarding possible cooperation.

Jay Sekulow, an attorney for the president, told CNBC he wasn't surprised by Flynn's decision. Such a move is a typical when a plea is being discussed, Sekulow said. An attorney for Flynn did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

""Assuming that the story is true, cooperation is the most likely explanation,"" Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel under Kenneth Starr, told CNBC.

Flynn was an important advisor to the Trump campaign and served briefly as national security advisor in the Trump White House. He resigned after only 24 days in the administration following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence regarding conversations he had with top Russian officials.

Trump made Flynn national security advisor despite the retired Army lieutenant general telling members of the transition team he was under investigation for his undisclosed work on behalf of the Turkish government.

The fact that Flynn's attorneys have stopped cooperating with Trump's team does not necessarily mean that Flynn is cooperating with prosecutors. The Times wrote: ""Some lawyers withdraw from information-sharing arrangements as soon as they begin negotiating with prosecutors. And such negotiations sometimes fall apart.""

In March, Flynn's attorney released a statement saying that ""General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.""

The president tweeted at the time that Flynn ""should ask for immunity,"" arguing that investigations into his former advisor were a ""witch hunt.""

The Senate Intelligence Committee later rejected Flynn's immunity request, NBC News reported. Here's how Flynn's attorney responded to the situation in March:

But that relationship is showing signs of fraying.

China makes up more than 80 percent of North Korean trade and has been credited for holding up the regime, but analysts say that China has become more assertive this year in exercising pressure on its ally.

Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul and a specialist in Korean Studies, wrote on Monday that there is an ""ongoing U-turn in China's North Korean policy.""

He cited strong Chinese support for ""the toughest"" United Nations Security Council-approved resolution ever on the North Korean issue — an action which he said surprised many observers, including him.

He added that Chinese policymakers and scholars are now saying that ""China has had enough and should switch to a tougher policy.""

Over the last week, China deployed a special envoy to North Korea for the first time since February last year. China-watchers deemed the four-day trip as important, but its consequences were not immediately apparent.

For its part, North Korea is likely to be feeling the effects of China's new approach.

China released figures last month showing that its fuel exports to North Korea fell sharply in September. Imports of North Korean coal was down 71.6 percent from last year, while exports of petrol were down 99.6 percent.","the

Trump said in a teleconference with the troops on Thanksgiving Day that more progress has been made in recent months in Afghanistan and in fighting the Islamic State group than had been made in years of the previous administration.

He said of the situation in Afghanistan that: ""Everybody's talking about the progress you've made in the last few months since I opened it up.""

Trump accused the previous administration of not allowing soldiers on the ground to do their jobs. But he said that now, ""We're not fighting anymore to just walk around, we're fighting to win.""

He added that, ""We're being talked about again as an armed forces. We're really winning."" Before, he said, ""They weren't letting you win.""

Earlier Thursday, Trump tweeted a Thanksgiving Day message for the nation: Look at all I've done.

Trump told followers in an early-morning holiday tweet that, ""your Country is starting to do really well.""

He said: Jobs are ""coming back, highest Stock Market EVER, Military getting really strong, we will build the WALL, V.A. taking care of our Vets, great Supreme Court Justice, RECORD CUT IN REGS, lowest unemployment in 17 years....!""

Trump is celebrating the holiday from his private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump later visited a Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach, Florida.

The president praised the Coast Guard for its work in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.

""There's no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard,"" he said. ""What a job you've done.""

The first couple provided lunch for the men and women spending Thanksgiving at the station near Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, including turkey sandwiches, giant muffins, heaping baskets of fruit, chips and cookies.","palm beach florida trump

Now China, under President Xi Jinping, is trying to reopen that channel of commerce through the Belt and Road initiative (also known as ""One Belt, One Road""). A string of projects, typically led by corporations using funding from China and other countries, seeks to build up infrastructure in the surrounding regions.

China also hopes to benefit economically from improved growth in the region. In November 2014, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced a domestic stimulus program called ""Nurly Zhol"" (Bright Path) which called for $9 billion in state and foreign direct investment into infrastructure and industries such as agribusiness and information technology, in an effort to move the economy away from the oil industry.

""Their demand for tires, more building materials, cement, steel … day by day, increases a lot,"" Gai said, speaking with a group of U.S. journalists during a September visit to Xi'an.

The Central Asian country also sends food to China. Oilseeds grown in Kazakhstan are exposed to far less pollution than they would be in China, Gai said. The railway transfers the seeds to Xi'an, where they are turned into oil. The finished product, a regional cooking oil called rapeseed oil, is then sent back over the railroad to Kazakhstan.

That process cuts costs by about 20 percent for local oil producer Aiju, Liu Dongming, vice president and deputy party secretary, told the U.S. journalists. The company also has a processing plant in Kazakhstan.","nurly zhol bright path

And every year, a team that's virtually guaranteed to take the field is the Dallas Cowboys, who played their first Thanksgiving Day game in 1966. The Detroit Lions were the first team to play on the holiday, hosting their inaugural game in 1934 as a way to drum up increased interest in the team. Although the Lions lost, the game sold out with more than 26,000 fans packing into the stadium.

Thanks to the Lions' success, in the 1960's the National Football League decided it wanted to put on another Turkey Day game but had trouble getting a team to agree to play, as it would be a huge risk for anyone who signed on. Weeknight games were still rare and an evening slot on Thanksgiving would interrupt a lot of families' dinners. Most teams shied away.

But Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm recognized this would be a prime marketing opportunity for his team.","national football league

Joe Barton of Texas apologized to his constituents Wednesday for a nude photo of himself that began circulating the internet earlier this week.

In a statement published by The Texas Tribune, the Republican congressman acknowledged the authenticity of the photo and apologized to his constituents.

""While separated from my second wife, prior to the divorce, I had sexual relationships with other mature adult women. Each was consensual. Those relationships have ended. I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down.""

Barton, the longest-serving congressman from Texas, is just the latest government official embroiled in a sexual scandal, but he made sure to clarify that he was involved in consensual relationships with ""mature adult women"" at the time the photo was taken.

The photo, which was posted to an anonymous Twitter account, emerged online after the congressman announced his bid for re-election to the House earlier this month, according to The Texas Tribune. It's unclear how the nude photo got online or who posted it.

Barton told The Texas Tribune in an interview Tuesday that he was deliberating about his political future. But a spokesperson for Barton, who has represented Texas' 6th Congressional District since 1985, said on Wednesday that he had no plans to resign and had filed for re-election, according to the Tribune.

Barton's office did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.","relationships

Like the rest of Europe, Italians in recent years have embraced the U.S. tradition of Black Friday, a day of heavy discounting by retailers on the day after Thanksgiving.

Unions said in a statement more than 500 Amazon workers at the Piacenza site in northern Italy had agreed to strike following a failure to negotiate bonuses with the company.

Workers have also decided not to do any overtime until Dec. 31, covering the peak season for the online retailer which hires temporary workers during this period.

Amazon employs around 1,600 people on a permanent basis at the Piacenza site, the first it built in the country after launching its Italian website in 2010.

The Verdi trade union in Germany said Amazon employees would also strike on Friday at six distribution centers in the country as part of a long-running dispute over pay and conditions.

""The world's biggest online retailer wants to achieve record sales on this day, but employees have to produce record performance not only on this day so that everything runs how Amazon wants it,"" said Verdi board member Stefanie Nutzenberger.

Amazon in Italy said in a statement it remained focused on trying to guarantee scheduled deliveries for its customers on Black Friday and in the following days.

The company said salaries paid to its workers were among the highest in the logistic sector and that it also provided some benefits such as private medical insurance or money to pay for training programs.

E-commerce is growing fast in Italy where online sales account only for 10 percent of overall retail sales, according to consultancy EY, half the European average.","the

Researchers at the University of Southampton in the U.K. gathered observational data on the impact of coffee on all aspects of the human body and published the results in the British Medical Journal on Tuesday.

Health experts warned people should not start drinking coffee, or increasing their intake, for health reasons. Too much coffee for women during pregnancy could also be harmful, the study said.","university of southampton

Losses were seen in automakers and manufacturing names. Technology stocks were a mixed picture: Nintendo rose 3.55 percent, SoftBank Group gained 1.4 percent and Sharp was down 1.26 percent by the end of the day.

Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi tacked on 0.28 percent to end at 2,544.33, with tech heavyweight Samsung Electronics gaining 0.29 percent. Financials drifted slightly lower.

Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.06 percent to close at 5,982.55. The industrials and information technology sub-indexes fell 0.42 percent and 0.74 percent respectively by the end of the session.

In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite eked out gains of 0.06 percent to close at 3,353.82 after trading in negative territory earlier in the day. The index finished the week 1.14 percent lower. The Shenzhen Composite meanwhile lost 0.09 percent to end at 1,922.72, closing the week down 2.5 percent. The blue-chip CSI 300 index, which suffered its largest one-day fall since June 2016 on Thursday, closed higher by 0.04 percent after choppy trade.

Insurers closed mostly lower, although banks and brokerages finished the session mixed. Airlines finished the session with significant gains, with China Eastern Airlines rising 4.98 percent on the day.

A combination of tighter rules for online micro-lenders and firmer bond prices were seen as reasons for the declines on Thursday. Stocks hit by the recent sell-off had in fact risen in the past weeks and still boasted relatively good fundamentals, according to market watchers. ""There was panic selling in the market,"" said Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital International.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fared better in comparison, climbing 0.54 percent by 3:25 p.m. HK/SIN after closing 1 percent lower on Thursday. Still, the index remained below the 30,000 mark that it topped for the first time in a decade earlier this week.","softbank group

The source added that the decision to cease informal information-sharing could be an indication Flynn is preparing to plead guilty in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

The New York Times first reported the change Thursday, citing four people involved with the case, and added that it could be ""an indication that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with prosecutors or negotiating ... a deal.""

While Flynn's lawyers had previously shared information with Trump's team, the change does not necessarily indicate that Flynn is cooperating with Mueller.

Jay Sekulow, a member of Trump's legal team, said that the decision to no longer share information ""is not entirely unexpected"" and shouldn't be seen as an indication of cooperation.

From meetings to emails, to text messages and Skype sessions, these lists have been growing throughout the year as more details drip out in the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections.

Overall statistics

More on Trump associates' contacts with Russians

At least 12 of President Donald Trump's associates had contact with Russians during the presidential campaign or transition, according to their own statements, court filings and reporting from CNN and others.

Some interactions were straightforward, like a public handshake with the Russian ambassador. Others are more controversial, such as a secret meeting to get ""dirt"" on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

This number has grown throughout the year, largely thanks to public reporting that has forced new acknowledgments and explanations from Trump's associates. All of the Trump associates who have spoken out deny any improper contacts with Russians and deny participating in any collusion with the Kremlin to influence the US election.

This list included White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Donald Trump Jr., former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and others affiliated with the Trump campaign and business empire.

Trump's aides and associates had at least 19 face-to-face meetings with Russians or people affiliated with the Russian government during the presidential campaign and transition, according to their public statements, court filings and reporting from CNN and other outlets.

Some of these meetings were about the campaign -- like Trump adviser George Papadopoulos' meetings with Russians in Europe. Others were claimed to be for non-campaign purposes, like when then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., met the Russian ambassador in his Senate office.

In all, there were at least 51 communications during the campaign or transition between Trump associates and Russians or people closely affiliated with the Russian government, according to their public statements, court filings and reporting from CNN and other news outlets.

These interactions include face-to-face meetings, phone calls, text messages, emails, private messages on social media and online video chats. The vast majority of these exchanges became known only after Trump took office.

About one-third of these interactions came from Papadopoulos and were revealed in October in court filings prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller's team before Papadopoulos' guilty plea.

On at least nine occasions, Trump and his senior officials denied that there had been any contacts whatsoever with Russians during the campaign or that there were any ties between the campaign and Russians.

These denials petered out last spring as more and more interactions were reported in the media. But before those reports, Trump himself and other senior administration officials offered blanket denials that had been any communication between campaign officials and Russians.

""Russia is a ruse,"" Trump said in February. ""I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. ... I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.""

Days after the election, now-White House Communications Director Hope Hicks issued denials on behalf of the Trump campaign about the issue of Russia contacts. She told The New York Times that the campaign was ""not aware of any campaign representatives that were in touch with any foreign entities"" during the election. And she told The Associated Press that ""there was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.""","michael flynn donald trump

Washington (CNN) Senate judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dianne Feinstein sent a letter Thursday requesting more information on President Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner related to his security clearance and questions over whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.

The two senators specifically requested ""transcripts from other committee interviews, additional documents from previous requests, communications with (former national security adviser) Michael Flynn and documents related to his security clearance,"" according to their statement.

Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and Feinstein, a California Democrat, sent a letter to Kushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, requesting he provide access to the transcripts from Kushner's interviews with other congressional committees.

They wrote there are missing documents, such as emails to Kushner on WikiLeaks and a ""Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite"" that Kushner forwarded to another campaign official.

The two senators also requested all communications related to Flynn's termination as national security adviser and any emails between the two that contain keywords such as ""Clinton,"" ""WikiLeaks"" and ""Putin.""

Texas attorney general says he will appeal federal judge's ruling

(CNN) A federal judge has struck down Texas' ban on a common second-trimester abortion procedure.

On Wednesday, US District Judge Lee Yeakel overturned Texas Senate Bill 8 -- which was passed earlier this year and banned doctors from performing dilation and evacuation abortions.

""That a woman may make the decision to have an abortion before a fetus may survive outside her womb is solely and exclusively the woman's decision. The power to make this decision is her right,"" Yeakel wrote.

In a D&E abortion, a doctor dilates the patient's cervix before dismembering and removing the fetus. Senate Bill 8 banned doctors from performing such abortions unless they first stopped a fetus' heart using another method.

A number of abortion providers and women's health groups, including Planned Parenthood and Whole Woman's Health, challenged the law. Banning the procedure -- the most common type of abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy -- means women must seek riskier alternatives, they argued.","secondtrimester

Trump also spoke directly to a Marine Corps unit serving in Iraq, thanking them for their efforts against the terrorist organization ISIS.

""What you are doing with ISIS is again being talked about -- with armed forces, we're really winning. We know how to win, but we have to let you win. You weren't winning before. They were letting you play even. We want to let you win,"" Trump said, referencing the Obama administration.

At various times during the conference Trump contrasted his own leadership with that of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama: ""They say we've made more progress against ISIS than they did in years with the previous administration, and that's because I'm letting you perform your job.""

Washington (CNN) A former director of the US Office of Government Ethics says he filed an official complaint against White House counselor Kellyanne Conway for what he argues was a violation of the Hatch Act after she attacked GOP Alabama Senate hopeful Roy Moore's opponent on television.

Walter Shaub, who served as ethics director under the Obama administration, said Conway likely violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits White House officials from advocating for or against candidates, even in media interviews.

Speaking to Fox News Monday, Conway addressed the heated Alabama race and Moore's Democratic competitor, saying, ""Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don't be fooled. He will be a vote against tax cuts. He is weak on crime. Weak on borders. He is strong on raising your taxes. He is terrible for property owners.""

Conway added: ""I just want everybody to know, Doug Jones, nobody ever says his name, and pretends he is some kind of conservative Democrat in Alabama. And he's not.""

Shaub tweeted following news of the interview Tuesday, ""I found the video. She's standing In front of the White House. It seems pretty clear she was appearing in her official capacity when she advocated against a candidate. This is at least as clear a violation of 5 U.S.C. § 7323(a)(1) as OSC identified with regard to Castro.""

Under the narrowed definition, in place since February, gun purchases can only be denied to fugitives who have crossed state lines to avoid prosecution for a crime or to avoid giving testimony in a criminal proceeding. The change makes it possible for someone with an outstanding warrant who would have previously been prohibited from buying a firearm to obtain one, unless barred for some other reason.

According to the administration official, the decision to change the definition took place late last year under the Obama administration, after a review by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, but it was officially implemented under the Trump administration in February.

""The Justice Department is committed to working with law enforcement partners across the country to help ensure that all those who can legally be determined to be prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm be included in federal criminal databases,"" a Justice Department official told CNN.

The Washington Post first reported the purge of names.

Joe Barton surfaced this week on an anonymous Twitter account, the congressman -- one of the most senior members of the House of Representatives -- is raising the possibility that he's the victim of ""revenge porn,"" a criminal act in Texas.",2017-11-23T19:08:43Z,cnn,Explicit Barton image raises possibility of 'revenge porn',http://us.cnn.com/2017/11/23/politics/joe-barton-image-revenge-porn/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171122170536-02-joe-barton-file-super-tease.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"(CNN) After a sexually explicit photo of Texas Republican Rep. Joe Barton surfaced this week on an anonymous Twitter account, the congressman -- one of the most senior members of the House of Representatives -- is raising the possibility that he's the victim of ""revenge porn,"" a criminal act in Texas.

The anonymous tweet, circulated this week on social media, included a nude image of the congressman -- which he does not deny is legitimate.

Sarah Dodd of Dodd Communications, who is helping Barton respond to the image, confirmed that the image is of him and on Wednesday the Congressman apologized for not using ""better judgment"" while separated from his wife and in consensual relationships with women.

""While separated from my second wife, prior to the divorce, I had sexual relationships with other mature adult women,"" Barton said in a statement first reported by The Texas Tribune . ""Each was consensual. Those relationships have ended. I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down.""

But Dodd told CNN that Barton did not release the image himself and does not know who did.

""It's really a violation of his privacy,"" she said.

Wednesday evening, an unnamed woman came forward to The Washington Post , telling the newspaper that Barton sent her lewd photos, videos and messages when they had two sexual encounters over the course of five years.

In a 2015 phone call, Barton allegedly confronted the woman over her communications with other women, including her decision to share explicit materials he had sent, the Post reported.

The woman shared that secretly recorded phone call with the paper and, according to the Post, in that call, he warned her against using the explicit images he had sent her, in a way that would negatively affect his career -- vowing that he would go to the Capitol Hill police over her actions.

The woman told the Post she took that phone call as a threat, and she never had any intention to use the materials to retaliate against Barton.

Barton, in a statement released through a spokesman, says it was to stop her from publicly releasing the images as ""revenge porn."" Revenge porn -- when sexually explicit images are posted online without consent -- was outlawed in Texas in 2015.

""The Dallas Morning News has identified a potential crime against me and the transcript referenced in the Washington Post may be evidence,"" he said. ""This woman admitted that we had a consensual relationship. When I ended that relationship, she threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation. As the transcript reflects, I offered to take the matter to the Capitol Hill Police to open an investigation. Today, the Capitol Police reached out to me and offered to launch an investigation and I have accepted. Because of the pending investigation, we will have no further comment.""

CNN has not independently confirmed the woman's account, nor independently viewed the videos or message.

""I was in it for the politics connection,"" the woman said of their relationship, in The Washington Post

""I was kind of unwittingly drawn into it with him because of just the amazement of having a connection to a congressman,"" she said, according to the Post.

Barton, the longest-serving member of the Texas House delegation, had announced plans to seek re-election to Congress earlier this month. Dodd said that Barton ""is not resigning.""

AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said that the Wisconsin Republican had spoken to Barton, adding, ""We will keep those conversations between the two of them.""

She declined to elaborate on the specifics of their exchange.

Dodd said that Barton is using her firm to handle this matter rather than his congressional office because ""it's the holiday weekend"" and there have been ""a lot of calls"" about the image and he needed the ""extra help.""

Dodd would not comment as to whether Barton expects other images to surface.","the

It could easily get campy, but Before the Storm skirts that line really well. How did you manage to match the emotional tone established by Dontnod?

A big part of it is trying to remember what it feels like to be a teenager. Maybe reconstruct that experience, and I think that's where a lot of the inherent drama and maybe melodrama comes from. And, of course, Chloe at her heart, her story at this particular time is extremely dramatic and emotional. And she has that particular character, that real personality that's kind of brash and a little bit difficult and argumentative sometimes. That adds a lot of that teenage angst.

But I think we also then try to balance it out with some kind of true-to-life lessons that we've taken away from studying the process of grief. In Chloe's case, that's really relevant, having lost parents. What is that like, how do people react to that? If you don't have someone to share it with -- like Chloe doesn't have Max with her during this period of her life -- we try to examine that in a very true-to life-way and work some of those elements in there. I think that's what kind of tempers this from feeling like just a soap opera.

I think our writers have just done a really, really good job doing their research on that front and trying to be honest with that experience.

The team researched the grieving process?

Yeah, definitely. The writers, in particular, looked at memoirs written about the grieving process and they looked at some psychological research on that as well. I can say things like William appearing in dreams, for instance, is an experience that they ran across in researching the lives of people going through grief. And how they kind of relate to their lost love ones in the ways that they can, the way those people still live with them and are never really gone in their minds.

Was there an outline for Chloe and Rachel Amber's personalities, or is that all Deck Nine?

We were pretty much just going off of what you hear Chloe say and other characters say about Rachel from the original game. Which, as I say, didn't have a lot of details. So, that was great. That was part of the appeal because we knew this was a character coming into another character's life and just changing it radically.

You got to create Rachel Amber however you wanted. I've been calling her, in my head, a ""manic pixie nightmare girl."" Not a manic pixie dream girl -- she's a little darker than that.

That's an interesting twist. Yeah, I think that's fair. We did really want to make sure -- because we knew how much Chloe loved her -- that she was lovable. Extremely lovable, especially as we're seeing her through Chloe's eyes. And yet, we also know a lot of troubling things about her from season one. So we had to include a touch of that as well.

There's still one episode left in Before the Storm. How's the pressure now?

We're anxious because we know a lot of people are very invested in it, a lot of storylines for us to kind of touch on and tie up. But, I think we feel pretty confident in the ending of the story as we have it. We really think that we're going to really do justice to this relationship between Chloe and Rachel. We think fans are gonna love it.","and

The idea here is that public disclosure of these historically banned practices -- and a reduction in other, more technical reporting obligations -- will allow consumers to make informed decisions about their internet provider. Of course, this only holds up if customers have more than one provider to choose from. Many Americans have just one or two ISPs in their area.

Under the FCC's 2010 Open Internet Order, ISPs are required to report how they manage congestion, store traffic information, rate their services and handle other practices. This information must be presented in an easily accessible space, such as on the company's website. The new proposal adds four reporting categories to this list: blocking, throttling, affiliated prioritization and paid prioritization. In each case, the ISP is expected to disclose the practice and provide details about exactly which sites or streams are being blocked, degraded or boosted.

ISPs will be required to report these practices -- as long as they aren't able to be classified as ""reasonable network management."" This is a term defined in the 2010 Open Internet Order as follows:

""A network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate and tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose, taking into account the particular network architecture and technology of the broadband Internet access service.""

If Verizon, T-Mobile or AT&T can make throttling sound like a legitimate practice -- something they've all done -- they won't have to share it publicly at all.

ISPs are still beholden to anti-trust and consumer laws, and if a company does disclose any of these practices, the Federal Trade Commission or FCC can step in. The FTC is picking up a lot of power in this entire transaction: The FCC loses its authority to regulate broadband once it's no longer considered a telecommunications service, allowing the FTC to take over.

While the FTC can't impose actual rules over ISPs, it can report back to Congress if it uncovers issues that negatively affect consumers. The FCC and FTC have joint authority to investigate anti-competitive behavior, but overall, the proposal is designed to place more power at the feet of the FTC, an agency with significantly less punitive power than the FCC.

The FCC argues these changes are in the interest of sparking innovation. For the past two years, ISPs have been subject to reporting requirements as laid out under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, and the FCC calls these ""unnecessary and burdensome."" Supporters of net neutrality argue the opposite: The Electronic Frontier Foundation, for instance, says, ""The FCC's new approach invites a future where only the largest internet, cable, and telephone companies survive, while every start-up, small business, and new innovator is crowded out.""

With this week's proposal, the FCC is trusting ISPs to tell the public whenever they engage in business practices that have historically drawn ire from customers. It doesn't ban these practices, instead betting companies will transform them into new, pro-consumer experiences. The FCC is taking a massive leap of faith when it comes to ISP transparency -- and all of America is along for the ride.","broadband internet access service

Steve Dent,Elon Musk easily won his $50 million Australian bet by finishing the Powerpack installation 45 days ahead of time.,2017-11-23T12:31:00Z,engadget,Tesla completes its giant Australian Powerpack battery on time,https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/23/tesla-australia-powerpack-100-day-bet/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D4000%252C2582%252C0%252C79%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1033%26image_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252Fba88a4f84905f8837947480c27f1e5e3%252F205888147%252Fteslainc-powerpacks-that-will-be-used-to-form-theworlds-stand-on-at-picture-id855480494%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3D6efbd0006f26bd523ba8837bee272a2ee7f2e717&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=46d38953aac0d33acb139ae123788f79d920ca4a,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"""An enormous amount of work has gone in to delivering this project in such a short time,"" said South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill in a statement. ""The world's largest lithium ion battery will be an important part of our energy mix.""

Musk famously promised to build the Powerpack-based system in 100 days, but that now seems more like a savvy PR move than an actual bet. Musk said that the clock would start when the contract was signed, and on that day (September 29th), the project was actually about half done, as the photo above shows. That said, Tesla finished a whopping 45 days ahead of schedule, and if you don't count weekends, Tesla did actually finish the project exactly 99 days after Musk made the initial bet.

The next step is to test the Powerpack system, which is designed to backup around 30,000 homes -- exactly the number that were affected by a long blackout in September, 2016. That set off a storm of criticism in South Australia, include a sharp exchange between Weatherill and Australian Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg.

Critics of solar and wind energy claim that unlike coal or nuclear, it's often not dependable -- sometimes, obviously, the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. Lithium battery backup systems from companies like Tesla can charge up when such power plants are productive, however, and then provide backup energy when they're not.

Tesla sells the Powerwall system for individual homes, letting users get more out of their solar panels. The Powerpack, however, is aimed at businesses and large power producers. The Hornsdale farm is currently the largest battery backup installation in the world at 100 megawatts, but as solar and wind energy become increasingly popular, that record is likely to be shattered soon.","south australian

It’s been four decades since the original Star Wars introduced us to a galaxy far, far away, and now the eighth installment in the Skywalker saga will soon be hitting theaters. Writer-director Rian Johnson is joining the series with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and with less than a month to go, EW has you covered with a Jedi-specific countdown clock.

The Last Jedi picks up where 2015’s The Force Awakens left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) coming face to face with the exiled Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Gwendoline Christie, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, and the late Carrie Fisher are all returning for the new installment, and they’re joined by new characters played by Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro, and Kelly Marie Tran.

“The very first step in the writing of this was figuring out why [Luke is] on that island,” Johnson told EW earlier this year. “We know that he is not a coward. He’s not just hiding because he’s scared. But we also know that he must know his friends are in danger. He must know the galaxy needs him. And he’s sitting on this island in the middle of nowhere. There had to be an answer. It had to be something where Luke Skywalker believes he’s doing the right thing – and the process of figuring out what that is and unpacking it is the journey for Rey.”

The clock ends Dec. 15, when The Last Jedi hits theaters. Check out all of EW’s Star Wars coverage here.","jedi luke skywalker mark hamill john boyega oscar isaac gwendoline christie adam driver domhnall gleeson

It’s been a minute since we paid a visit to Apocalypse World, and this week is quick to catch us up. It seems Michael has chained up Lucifer and has been using his powers to take trips inside Lucy’s head in order to get a glimpse of his world. Apparently, the idea of alternate universes is not a new concept for Michael…or Kevin. That’s right! Kevin Tran is back! Well, sort of.

It’s not the Kevin Tran we know and love, but rather it’s Apocalypse World’s version of Kevin. Yes, he’s still a prophet, which is why he’s been annotating the angel tablets to help Michael. Kevin has been trying to find a way to create a rift between universes, and he thinks he’s found something. The key ingredient? An archangel’s grace. So naturally, Michael steals some from Lucifer. Not all of it, but let’s just say that Lucifer’s wings aren’t nearly as full as they were when he put Crowley in his place last season.

But if there’s one thing Lucifer will never lose, it’s his survival instincts and his ability to make any situation work for him. Example A: When Apocalypse World Kevin does manage to create a rift, Lucy takes the opportunity to jump through it, after which it closes back up. It seems Kevin’s spell only admits one person/being through the rift at a time (which complicates Michael’s promise to bring Kevin with him to “paradise world”).

Speaking of “paradise world” — a.k.a. the real world — Castiel is determined to do everything he can to find Jack, including going off on his own to talk to angels he doesn’t know very well. And because angels aren’t big on strangers, he convinces Sam and Dean to stay behind. But because the Winchesters suck at doing nothing, the two of them decide to work a case. It seems someone is killing witches in a ritualistic fashion. And that someone just so happens to look a whole lot like Mr. Ketch. But it can’t be Ketch…right? Because Mary put a bullet in his head…right?

Long story short, the boys aren’t sure if it’s Ketch. After a witch approaches them asking for help, they use her as bait to catch Ketch, only he claims he’s Alexander Ketch, twin brother of Arthur Ketch. “Alexander” then spins a very elaborate backstory, and according to Sam, he’s got the paperwork to back it up. But Dean’s not buying it. And there’s still the question of why this guy was killing witches in search of Rowena.

When Dean gets a call about a kidnapped front desk clerk from the motel they stayed at in Dodge City, he and Sam hit the road, leaving “Alexander” chained up in the bunker. As for that front desk clerk, well, Asmodeus has him in Hell. After learning that the Winchesters no longer have Jack, Asmodeus ups his game, tracking down anyone who might’ve seen Jack recently. But when the front desk clerk proves to be a dead end, he kills the poor guy. (Or rather, one of his demons does.)

Asmodeus then senses something…or rather someone. And that someone is Lucifer, back in the real world and currently saving Castiel. Let me explain: Castiel meets his angel friend at the playground to ask if heaven has Jack. She assures him that they don’t, because if they did, they’d put him to work. It seems that no one has made a new angel since the dawn of creation and ever since the fall, they’re going extinct. If they had Jack, maybe he could create more angels. In fact, they’d like Castiel to help them get their hands on Jack, you know, for the good of angelkind. But Castiel isn’t interested, and when a fight breaks out, it’s Lucy who shows up and scares the other angels off with his red eyes. He might not have all his grace, but he manages to fool these guys. (Recap continues on page 2)","alexander ketch twin brother of arthur ketch

The daughter of Sen. John McCain tied the knot with conservative pundit Ben Domenech on Tuesday — and PEOPLE has your exclusive first photo from the nuptials, which took place just before sunset at the family lodge in Sedona, Arizona.

The 33-year-old co-host of ABC’s The View — who paired her gown with a white fur stole — was beaming with joy as she and her groom posed alongside her mother Cindy and her father, who wore a boot for a torn Achilles tendon.

Sierra Blanco Photography

The pre-Thanksgiving celebration — for approximately 100 guests including close friends, family and former colleagues who worked on Sen. McCain’s two presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2008 — came just four months after he revealed that he was battling glioblastoma, an aggressive stage 4 brain cancer.

A rep for the bride told PEOPLE in an exclusive statement that Sen. McCain, 81, gave his daughter away before she was married by John Dickerson. Following the ceremony, the couple celebrated with dinner and dancing surrounded by their family and close friends.

Wedding planner Jim Bullock from Events by Showstoppers tells PEOPLE that the theme of the wedding was Western hunting lodge — “very 1920s-looking” — featuring a cigar bar and gambling casino with roulette tables, poker tables and slot machines.

In terms of décor, a taxidermist provided options such as deer and buffalo heads, and McCain’s wedding bouquet was “wild” and “flowery.”

The menu was all wild game — “something you would have if you were in a tented hunting lodge,” Bullock explains— and for the ceremony, they had an arbor made of birch limbs and bleached elk horns at the end of the aisle, positioned near a beautiful creek.

McCain, who “didn’t want a traditional wedding,” chose to walk down the aisle covered with cow hides.

“Meghan is very cool and she just kind of didn’t say no to anything,” Bullock says. “She really went 100 percent with everything.”

McCain and Domenech got engaged at the Mayo Clinic in July, shortly after her father’s diagnosis.

“We got engaged because we decided to sort of celebrate life, and celebrate being alive,” she said on The View earlier this month. “It’s not the most romantic story, but he is my partner.”

And Domenech, a conservative blogger and TV personality who publishes the online magazine, The Federalist, already has his father-in-law’s seal of approval.

“He’s a very fine man,” Sen. McCain said during an October appearance on his daughter’s daytime talk show. “I’m very proud and very happy that they’re so happy together.”","prethanksgiving

In real life, the man behind Emmett Cullen, Kellan Lutz, just made that same commitment and married girlfriend Brittany Gonzales.

Lutz made the announcement with a post on Instagram that showed the two of them holding “Mr.” and “Mrs.” passport holders with their wedding rings on full display.

“Thanksgiving by far is my most favorite holiday of all,” he wrote. “I try to live a lifestyle of gratitude and appreciate everyone and everything I have every day. This year has been the best year of them all and I am extremely thankful and grateful to go on all of life’s adventures with my best friend and dream wife!!! Proverbs 18:22! Thank you God!

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH @brittanybg. Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!! What are you grateful for??”

Gonzales posted the same photo after she changed her name to Brittany Lutz on Instagram and wrote, “If you know me at all you know Thanksgiving is my FAVORITE holiday of them all!! While I try to live everyday grateful for everything and everyone in my life, this Thanksgiving one of the things I’m most grateful for is that I get to do life’s adventures with this guy aka my HUSBAND for the rest of our lives!!!!! I love you so much @kellanlutz.”

Lutz also posted a photo on his Instagram Stories in which he swapped his and Gonzales’ heads with bride and groom emojis.

Lutz revealed he was engaged last month during an appearance on Steve Harvey’s show, where he called her “the light of my life.”

The actor was even more forthcoming about his romance in an Instagram post last December when he wrote about meeting Gonzales that year and said, “I now know what true love looks like! I knew it the moment I saw her. She is the love of my life. The one God created for me! She is my best friend and the best teammate to shine brighter with.”

Lutz previously dated 90210‘s AnnaLynne McCord, The Vampire Diaries‘ Kayla Ewell, and Step Up 3D star Sharni Vinson.","emmett cullen kellan lutz

In an October interview with Access Hollywood that would later go viral, Thurman said of the allegations, “I don’t have a tidy soundbite for you because I’ve learned I am not a child and I have learned that when I’ve spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself. So I’ve been waiting to feel less angry and when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say.”

Thurman’s Kill Bill costar Daryl Hannah is one of the women to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct. On one occasion, Hannah said she had been forced to barricade herself in her hotel room to keep him out. She also shared that among the people she made aware of Weinstein’s actions was Quentin Tarantino, who directed Kill Bill, as well as Thurman in Pulp Fiction. Tarantino has since admitted that he “knew enough to do more than I did.”

Weinstein is under investigation by police in New York, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and the U.K. for sexual assault accusations made against him. He has denied claims of non-consensual sex.","new york los angeles beverly hills

In a report published Wednesday evening by BuzzFeed News, Anastasia Taneie detailed a 2009 run-in with the Emmy winner when she was appearing on the HBO series as a background extra. Taneie alleges that while shooting on location, the actor, who starred as super-agent Ari Gold, pulled her aside, and once they were alone, he forcibly pushed her against a wall and began groping her breasts and genitals. Taneie says Piven stopped after an assistant director allegedly walked by, at which point she claims Piven asked for her to be removed from set for coming on to him.

Piven has denied all of the sexual misconduct accusations made against him. The actor claims to have taken a polygraph test, the results of which BuzzFeed says his attorneys supplied to them and reportedly indicate he passed when asked about previous allegations.

“Let me be absolutely clear, this simply did not happen,” he told BuzzFeed in a statement. “I would never force myself on a woman. I cannot speak as to why a person would create a story like this.”

A rep for Piven gave EW the following statement:

Mr. Piven denies the situation falsely described. It did not happen. Mr. Piven took and passed a polygraph test to that effect. HBO has confirmed, with a public statement, that there has never been a single complaint about Mr. Piven arising from the production of Entourage, or otherwise. Anastasia Taneie is not credible. It is understood that Anastasia Taneie has various aliases, and is a/k/a Anastasia Sotomayor, and a/k/a Anastasia Kisling, who is reported to have been arrested for felony burglary and spent time in jail involving a scam to rip-off and harm another man, in which she was alleged to have gotten the victim to go out on a date with her while her accomplices burglarized his home. Ms. Taneie is understood to have been recruited by porn actress Ms. Bellamar to make accusation against Mr. Piven. (see, e.g., https://www.sportsplusshow.com/ariane-bellamar-exhibit-d and https://www.sportsplusshow.com/beyond-the-tweets-5). Ms. Bellamar’s lack of credibility has been well documented (https://theblast.com/jeremy-piven-polygraph-test-accusations-arianne-bellamar/) Given all the foregoing, this person is not a reliable or credible source. Mr. Piven, on the other hand, passed a polygraph test confirming the allegations are baseless and continues to maintain his innocence.

Calling it “the most horrible thing I’ve ever experienced,” Taneie says she didn’t issue a formal complaint. “I was scared at the time nobody was going to believe me,” she shared. “I didn’t want to make a scene. I just wanted to go home.”

“We reviewed our records and did not receive any complaints against Jeremy Piven on Entourage,” HBO said in a statement to EW. “HBO takes sexual harassment very seriously and we make it a priority to ensure that everyone experiences a safe and comfortable work environment.”

Piven currently stars on CBS’s Wisdom of the Crowd. The network and Piven’s legal representative did not immediately respond to EW’s request for comment.

The 33-year-old actress called out Ivanka Trump in a Thanksgiving Day Instagram post after realizing the businesswoman is following her on the social media app.

Wilde asked the First Lady, 36, to use her White House influence to advocate for a “CLEAN Dream Act” — an unaltered version of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (also known as DACA).

“I see you’re following me on Instagram. This Thanksgiving I would be grateful if you use the influence you have to advocate for a CLEAN Dream Act by December,” she began. “Every day that passes without a clean Dream Act means anxiety and deportation for immigrant youth.”

A post shared by Olivia Wilde (@oliviawilde) on Nov 23, 2017 at 9:11am PST

She added: “7,901 youth have already lost DACA and 122 more will lose it each day. Thank you and happy holidays.”

Many social media users took to the comment section of the post to praise Wilde for advocating for DREAMers, a group of over than 800,000 young immigrants that came to the United States when they were children and made their lives here, but are now facing the threat of deportation due to the imminent revocation of the DACA program.

The DACA program was created by the Obama administration in 2012. It allowed young undocumented immigrants to work, study and get driver’s licenses if they came to this country as children.

The mandate also protected them from deportation. In September, President Donald Trump decided to end the program, leaving the future of hundreds of thousands of immigrants uncertain.

Earlier this week, Ellen DeGeneres showed her support for DREAMers. The popular host of The Ellen DeGeneres Show wore a black shirt emblazoned with the message ‘We Are All Dreamers’ in white letters in an Instagram photo.

Others stars who have spoken out in favor of immigration reform and DREAMers include Lin Manuel Miranda, Luis Fonsi, Gina Rodriguez and America Ferrera.","lin manuel miranda luis fonsi gina rodriguez

The Brussels Griffon wins Best in Show in the National Dog Show! Presented by @Purina #DogThanking pic.twitter.com/OJgjrHwvmq — NBC Sports (@NBCSports) November 23, 2017

Chosen from seven classes, Newton beat out representatives from the hound, herding, working, terrier, sporting, and non-sporting categories, including a Portuguese Water Dog, English Springer Spaniel, American Staffordshire Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Whippet, and French Bulldog.

Social media users were quick to point out Newton’s striking facial similarities to Chewbacca, the Millennium Falcon’s furry co-pilot who first appeared in the Star Wars franchise’s 1977 debut. Others compared the four-legged victor to Ewoks, the fictional race of mammalian Endor inhabitants first seen in 1983’s Return of the Jedi.

Newton’s win — the first for a Brussels Griffon since NBC rebranded the Kennel Club of Philadelphia Dog Show as the National Dog Show in 2001 — comes just under a year after four-year-old Gia the Greyhound trotted away with the title in 2016.

Philip Rivers leads Los Angeles with 434 passing yards, surging past Dallas in a 28-6 win. (1:10)

DALLAS -- Playing his first game on Thanksgiving Day, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers put on a show. He threw for 434 yards and three touchdowns in a 28-6 victory over the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium.

With the win, the Chargers improved to 5-6, inching closer to a .500 record for the first time this season. The Bolts also firmly remain in the postseason conversation, just a half-game back of the Baltimore Ravens (5-5) for the final wild-card spot in the AFC.

The Chargers, who host the winless Cleveland Browns next week at the StubHub Center, have now won three straight and four of their past five games against the Cowboys.

Feast through the air Philip Rivers is the second player to throw for 400 yards on the road on Thanksgiving. Year Player Team Yards Opponent 2016 Kirk Cousins WSH 449 Cowboys 2017 Philip Rivers LAC 434 Cowboys 1995 Warren Moon MIN 384 Lions 2007 Brett Favre GB 381 Lions Source: Elias Sports Bureau

Rivers led the way for the Chargers, completing 27 of 33 passes. Rivers was not sacked and finished with a 149.1 passer rating.

The last time Rivers threw for more than 400 yards was on Oct. 18, 2015, when he threw for a career-high 503 yards in a 27-20 loss at Green Bay. It’s the ninth time Rivers has thrown for at least 400 yards.

According to the Elias Sports Bureau research, Rivers became the second player to throw for 400 yards on the road on Thanksgiving, joining Kirk Cousins, who threw for 449 yards in a 31-26 loss to the Cowboys last year.

For a second straight week, Rivers’ favorite target was Keenan Allen, who finished with 11 receptions for a career-high 172 yards, including a 42-yard touchdown. Tight end Hunter Henry totaled five receptions for 76 yards and a score.

The Chargers also forced two Dak Prescott interceptions, including a 90-yard pick-six by Desmond King. In their past seven games, the Chargers have forced 17 turnovers and recorded 17 sacks.

Rivers improved his record to 3-0 against Dallas. The Cowboys are one of three teams Rivers has never lost to in his career. The others are the 49ers (3-0) and Giants (3-0).

Along with playing on the road for the second time in three games on a short week, the Chargers had to overcome some injuries. Dealing with a back injury, place-kicker Nick Novak pushed a kick wide right from 35 yards and pulled an extra point wide left. Punter Drew Kaser took over for Novak, making an extra point at the end of third quarter but missing the next two.

Rookie wide receiver Mike Williams left the sideline on a cart with a knee injury and was ruled out for the rest of the game. Williams had been a limited participant all week with a knee issue.","chargers philip rivers

Courtney CroninESPN Staff Writer ,"Case Keenum had one of  his better statistical games  this season, and the Thanksgiving win in Detroit also qualifies as one of his most complete.",2017-11-23T21:13:28Z,espn,"Case Keenum leads Vikings over Lions, solidifying NFC North grip",http://espn.go.com/blog/minnesota-vikings/post/_/id/24596/case-keenum-leads-vikings-to-win-over-detroit-solidifying-grip-on-nfc-north,http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1123%2Fr293374_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"DETROIT -- Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Zimmer made waves this week when he detailed his favorite quality of his starting quarterback.

Guts. Moxie. Fortitude. However you want to phrase Zimmer's ""he's got big balls"" comment, Case Keenum continued to display why his willingness to take risks and give his playmakers a chance is a major reason the Vikings extended their win streak to seven games Thursday with a 30-23 victory over the Detroit Lions.

""Case is playing outstanding,"" Zimmer said after the game. ""He’s a great competitor, studies his rear end off, works extremely hard. Today, he seemed like he was more settled. There’s times when he gets a little bit excitable and kind of goes off the reservation a little bit. But today, even throughout the course of the game, he seemed like he was in a pretty good mindset.”

Statistically, his numbers in the first half against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- his first win of the season -- are his best so far, but Keenum played one of his most complete performances to date, making some exceptional throws in the first two quarters and serving as the catalyst in building a sizable early lead. It started on the Vikings' first drive by gaining three first downs, and he remained accurate under pressure.

Keenum didn't turn the ball over as he completed 21 of 30 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns. In what's been the basis for his success this season, the quarterback beat the blitz after being pressured by Detroit on 33 percent of his dropbacks, according to ESPN Stats & Information.

Keenum's nine passing touchdowns against the blitz this season are more than he'd had in his entire career. Thursday's win was the third time this season where Keenum has thrown multiple touchdowns against the blitz.

Being able to make throws in the face of pressure, whether it's from a team's standard pass rush or when they bring in extra defenders, is something Keenum takes pride in. His mobility remains one of the Vikings' biggest assets.

What you need to know in the NFL

• Statistics

• Scoreboard

• 2017 schedule, results

• Standings

""It’s a lot of drill work, being able to move in the pocket a little bit, keeping your eyes downfield,"" Keenum said. ""It’s trusting your guys. I have a lot of trust in my guys out there catching the football. Kyle [Rudolph], Adam [Thielen], [Stefon] Diggs, across the board. Jarius [Wright] made some big plays today. I love those guys. I trust those guys, and when you have that trust, it helps.”

Keenum was terrific at sensing pressure, confidently climbing the pocket and scrambling to keep drives alive. He used a play-action pass to hit a wide-open Rudolph for the first score of the game. He then relied on the option to run in his own 9-yard score on the Vikings' next drive.

“He has used his legs and he’s done that throughout the season,"" Zimmer said. ""You wouldn’t necessarily say he’s a scrambler, but I think he’s smart. When he sees some kind of coverages that he has an opportunity to do or -- maybe the best thing about him is he’s got great vision. I think he sees a lot of things that’s going on out on the field and maybe the game has slowed down for him throughout the course of time that he’s played.""

Arguably his biggest throw of the game came late in the fourth quarter with the Vikings ahead by four points. On third down, Diggs ran a crossing route toward the near side of the field. Keenum zipped a pass while being hit by Darius Slay, which his receiver grabbed for a 7-yard gain and the first down.

The drive resulted in a field goal. But on the Lions' ensuing possession, members of Minnesota's defense showed Keenum just how thankful they are that he's their quarterback when Xavier Rhodes picked off Matthew Stafford on fourth down, giving the Vikings the ball for the duration of the game.

""I don’t know who was in front of me to knock me down, but it was just a play we needed,"" Rhodes said. ""A play we needed to gain momentum, try to win the game, to kill the clock and it just was over.""

In eight games this season, Keenum has gone from a career journeyman to proficient veteran. He led the Vikings to their most pivotal win of the season, crushing any desire for Detroit to come back and win the NFC North. With a 9-2 record, the Vikings are now three games ahead of the second-place Lions in the division standings. The path to a division title is crystal clear for Minnesota.","kyle rudolph adam thielen stefon diggs

It's an awful feeling as the regret and frustration sweep over you. And the trash talk from your unforgiving leaguemates doesn't help.

Well, my friend, the internet and I are here to help.

Yes, you've screwed up. More than once. And you'll screw up again. But before you beat yourself up too much, understand it could be worse. Demonstrably so.

It's Thanksgiving week, and that means turkey, so it seems appropriate to talk ""fantasy turkeys."" I do a version of this column every year, and it's always a fun one. So, without further ado and with apologies once again to the band Oasis, it's time for the 2017 edition of ""Don't Look Back in Anger.""

This year, we had so many amazing entries I couldn't get to them all. If you want to see even more than what I've listed here, you should check out the thread under my @matthewberry profile on the Fantasy Life app, and this Twitter thread.

How great were this year's entries? Among the moves that didn't make the list; dropping Jared Goff for Mike Wallace, trading Larry Fitzgerald and Mark Ingram for Marcus Mariota and Jeremy Maclin, dropping Mark Ingram for Jamaal Williams, a guy who turned down Kareem Hunt and Alvin Kamara for Andrew Luck, trading Evan Engram for Jordan Matthews, dropping Robert Woods for Shane Vereen and someone who last week spent $70 of his $100 free-agent budget on ... Nathan Peterman.

Oh yeah. Some pretty awful moves, right? Feel better? Think there's no way there are moves worse than those? Hold my beer. Since it's Week 12, here are the top 12 fantasy turkeys of the year so far:

But you know what, Jovanny? Among the many traditions of Thanksgiving week is the president ""pardoning"" turkeys. So, in that grand tradition, I hereby pardon all of these fantasy turkeys, including yours. And I include myself in that group. Sorry about putting Alex Smith on the ""love"" list last week. Yeesh. No one can predict the future. All you can do is analyze all the data, study the games, stay up on the news and make the best decision you can. And then let the chips fall where they may.

So let's do just that and get to it. After some feedback, I'm trying a new version of the column this week, somewhere between the old format and the new format. This column is usually between 4,500 and 5,000 words every week, and, after the issues with my health, I adjusted the format to be less cumbersome in terms of writing it. I'm still messing around with the format to find the one that works best.

So we'll try this and see what folks think. I'll do more names as separate entries (instead of one separate player and then a bunch of others in one big paragraph) but instead of the paragraph or two I would do about each player the old way, instead I'll just do a line or two of analysis. Trust that the research is there, but do you need to see how the meat is cooked or can you just trust it's a tasty burger? Either way, the analysis is better than that metaphor. Thanks, as always, to Kyle Soppe and Jacob Nitzberg for their help at various points in this column. Unless otherwise noted, all stats are over the past four weeks.

Quarterbacks I love in Week 12

Taking off my analyst hat for a second, I'm personally thankful for Kirk Cousins being Washington's quarterback ... while it lasts. Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports

Kirk Cousins, Redskins: The second-best QB in fantasy since Week 3, Cousins is playing on a short week with little running back depth and a really banged-up offensive line (two starters to IR this week alone). What's that mean? Getting in the shotgun and chucking it. A lot. Against a Giants team allowing a league-high 21.6 points per game to opposing quarterbacks since Week 4. He always plays well against the Giants (at least 287 yards in each of his past four games against them) and despite a ""strong"" performance from the Giants' D last week in super-windy conditions, I am firing up Cousins confidently against a New York team that is 29th against the pass.

Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers: With 310-plus passing yards OR multiple passing TDs in four straight games, #HomeBen is in effect once more against a Packers defense that is 25th against the pass and allowing the fifth-most yards after the catch (per reception) the past four weeks. The Steelers, meanwhile, are gaining the sixth-most yards after the catch (per reception) in that same time frame. Since 2014, whenever Roethlisberger has played in two or three consecutive home games, he's rocked in the back-end games of the homestand. In fact, in those second or third games, he's averaged 29 fantasy points per game and thrown for at least 317 yards and at least two TDs in all six such games in that span. He's a top-five play for me.

Matt Ryan, Falcons: Congrats on the twins, Matty Ice! As a father of twins myself, let me tell you ... they're magic. It's awesome. You know what else is awesome? Facing a Tampa Bay defense that generates pressure at the lowest rate in the NFL this season (Ryan is top five in completion percentage when not under pressure) and has a bottom-10 pass defense. The Bucs are especially bad deep (bottom four in completion percentage, touchdowns and yards allowed on deep passes). The game is at home and Ryan quietly has multiple touchdowns in four straight games.

Others receiving votes: Since Bill Lazor took over as offensive coordinator of the Bengals, Andy Dalton's 16 passing touchdowns rank fifth in the NFL. Four of those TDs came against Cleveland in Week 4. Against an improving but still vulnerable Browns team, Dalton is a top-15 play and a solid streaming option. ... If you're ever gonna do it, Marcus Mariota, this is the week. The Colts have allowed double-digit fantasy points to every single QB they've face this season, a list that includes Brian Hoyer, Blake Bortles, DeShone Kizer and Tom Savage. ... The QB opposite him in that game, Jacoby Brissett is interesting as a QB2 with upside, as well. He's scored more than 15.5 fantasy points in three straight, and this is a good matchup against a Titans squad that has allowed the third-most passing touchdowns this season.

Quarterbacks I hate in Week 12

Watch The Fantasy Show every weekday The Fantasy Show with Matthew Berry airs at 5 p.m. ET on ESPN2 every weekday. We will, however, be on ESPN on Mondays during the season. There are also late night re-airs (check your listings and set those DVRs) and replays are always available on WatchESPN by clicking on the NFL tab.

Dak Prescott, Cowboys: His situation improves if Tyron Smith plays, but even if Smith can go, he probably won't be 100 percent against a Chargers team that is third in the NFL in sacks. If you go with Prescott, you're hoping for a rushing touchdown and some yardage, which is certainly possible because my expectation is Casey Hayward shuts down Dez Bryant (more on that later). Prescott has failed to throw a touchdown in three of his past four (and has less than 13.5 points in three of his past four as well). The Chargers have given up just four passing touchdowns in their past five games. And while that includes a game against Blake Bortles and a half against Nathan Peterman, it also includes games vs. Tom Brady and Derek Carr. Prescott is just outside my top 10.

Jared Goff, Rams: He's been great against bad defenses and very pedestrian against good defenses (fewer than 10 points in recent games against Seattle, Jacksonville and Minnesota). The Saints are a good defense. Despite Kirk Cousins' big game last week, the Saints are top five in the NFL in sacks, QB fantasy points per game, TD/INT rate, passing yards allowed and completion percentage allowed during their eight-game win streak. Goff is just outside my top 15 this week.

Derek Carr, Raiders: Carr has failed to throw multiple touchdown passes in three straight and in six of his past seven, so I'm not crazy about his chances against Denver. Yes, they are not the Broncos of old, but they are still solid, especially in pass defense, where they rank eighth the past four weeks. Carr has scored fewer than 14 points in three straight and four of his past five, and he now has fewer games with at least 14 fantasy points this season than Bortles and Kizer. He's merely a midtier QB2 this week.

Running backs I love in Week 12

There'll be more than one fantasy owner being thankful they drafted Kareem Hunt this season ... especially after it's his turn to run all over the Bills in Week 12. Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire

Kareem Hunt, Chiefs: I know. He's my fantasy ride or die. You think I don't know? I will say that he had 30 yards on two touches called back because of penalties last week against the Giants, and if those don't get called, I think his box score looks different. Anyway, despite the lack of scoring and how bad the Chiefs' offense has looked, I'm back in on him at home against the Bills. Since the Bills traded Marcell Dareus to Jacksonville, their rush defense has allowed 5.44 yards per carry, 10 touchdowns and 171 fantasy points (most in the NFL) to opposing running backs. With close to 20 touches guaranteed for Hunt in this one, he's a top-10 play for me.

Alfred Morris, Cowboys: He's averaging 5.1 yards per carry in the two games since Ezekiel Elliott got suspended. In the span, he's got 28 carries and has touched the ball on 63.6 percent of snaps compared to just 11 carries and touches on just 22.1 percent of snaps for Rod Smith. At home against a Chargers team that is allowing a league-high 138.9 rushing yards per game this season and the second-most yards per carry this season (4.93), Morris is a legit RB2 this week.

Orleans Darkwa, Giants: In games in which Darkwa has received at least 10 carries this season, he's averaging 4.7 yards per carry, and he has at least 70 rushing yards in three straight weeks. The only other guy who can say that? Mark Ingram. The banged-up Skins are 29th against the run and allow the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing running backs, including six rushing scores to running backs in the past six games. Darkwa is a top-20 play for me.

Others receiving votes: You're already starting Jerick McKinnon, but I also like Latavius Murray here. With at least 15 carries in five straight, the workload is surprisingly solid, and with four scores in his past four games, he's got a shot to get a fifth on Thanksgiving against a Lions team that has coughed up seven running back rushing scores in the past five games. ... The Bears' defense has allowed a running back to reach double-digit fantasy points in nine of 10 games this season. I say Jay Ajayi makes it 10 of 11 this week. ... After out-snapping C.J. Anderson in three straight games and with Paxton Lynch expected to be under center, Devontae Booker may be featured even more against a Raiders team that has allowed the fifth-most RB rushing yards this season and the third-most fantasy points to RBs the past four weeks. Booker is on the flex radar in 12-team or deeper leagues. ... It's more faith-based than anything, but the way you move the ball against Houston is by passing, not running, which should bode well for Danny Woodhead in his second game back. Now, the Texans are good against running backs in the passing game (fourth-fewest receiving yards to opposing running backs this season), but volume should keep Woodhead afloat here, as he played only 13 snaps last week but touched the ball on six of them. I'd expect an increased workload Monday night. ... Deeper-league fantasy managers can look at J.D. McKissic, who should get the majority of work, especially if Mike Davis can't go. San Fran allows the most receiving yards and is tied for the second-most receiving touchdowns allowed to running backs this season.

Running backs I hate in Week 12

Adrian Peterson, Cardinals: Peterson is averaging 1.57 yards per rush in his past two games. That is not a misprint: 1.57 yards. On 35 carries! And he has struggled when not facing bad run defenses. This week he gets the Jags, who are, in fact, the opposite of a bad defense. They are the No. 1 rushing defense and the No. 2 scoring defense, and they've allowed just 55 rushing yards per game since acquiring Marcell Dareus. Peterson might be lucky to get 55 yards in this one. Your only hope here is that Peterson falls into the end zone. No thanks.

Alex Collins, Ravens: He's averaging just 2.8 yards per carry in his past two games (on 33 carries), and now he faces the Texans, who haven't allowed a rushing touchdown to an opposing running back since Week 1. Since their Week 7 bye, Houston is giving up just 3.01 yards per rush, sixth lowest in the league. The Ravens are a home favorite, so maybe volume works in Collins' favor here, but my assumption is that Woodhead gets a lot more snaps after coming out of last week unscathed, while Collins is merely a touchdown-dependent flex in PPR leagues this week.

Joe Mixon, Bengals: So after Sunday's performance, Mixon is now last among 46 qualified RBs in yards per carry (2.91) this season. His most rushing yards in a game this season is 62. In fact, he hasn't reached 50 rushing yards in a game since Week 5. The Browns allow the second-fewest yards per rush to opposing RBs this year (3.15) and have allowed just two running back rushing scores since Week 4 (and only four total on the season). Yes, Leonard Fournette was good against them last week. Joe Mixon is not Leonard Fournette.

Wide receivers I love in Week 12

We have it on good authority that one thankful fantasy owner got to pick up Adam Thielen for free in Week 3. (Sorry, Mike M. Too soon?) Nick Wosika/Icon Sportswire

Adam Thielen, Vikings: An obvious name, but he makes the list because I have him as my No. 2 wideout this week, higher than most of the other rankers. The last time these two teams faced off, Stefon Diggs had the better game. I don't expect that to be the case this week, as the Lions have allowed the ninth-most passing yards to the slot since Week 4, and my expectation is that Darius Slay will shadow Diggs most of the time. Expect the Vikings to take some deep shots to Thielen, as he's tied with Brandin Cooks for the most deep (15-plus yards) receptions this season (Detroit can be beaten deep), and you know the volume will be there. The only guys with more targets than Thielen this season? DeAndre Hopkins, Antonio Brown, Jarvis Landry, Larry Fitzgerald and Dez Bryant. Nice list to be on.

T.Y. Hilton, Colts: Hilton drives me nuts. The ultimate boom-or-bust guy, this year he's been much more bust than boom. I expect that to change on Sunday, however, against a Titans secondary that allows the fifth-most points to opposing wide receivers (and second-most points over the past four weeks). It's definitely a risk/reward play, because when he's bad, he's brutal. But at home, off the bye, I like his chances of at least one big play and a top-20 finish.

Mohamed Sanu, Falcons: Sanu has scored in three of his past four games, and this is a strong matchup for him against a Tampa Bay defense that allows the second-most slot yards per game and the most slot touchdowns.

Others receiving votes: Assuming Matt Moore starts for the Dolphins, I like Kenny Stills to continue his connection with the backup quarterback in a game in which Miami will have to throw to keep up with New England. ... The Packers are 25th against the pass and have allowed the fourth-most passing plays of 15-plus yards. Assuming the hammy issue clears up (I wrote this Tuesday night), JuJu Smith-Schuster is a solid flex for me this week. ... In the past four weeks, the Texans have allowed 24 receptions (five more than any other team) and 396 receiving yards (77 more than any other team) to opposing WRs lined up in the slot. I see you, Jeremy Maclin. ... We keep waiting for a Josh Doctson breakout game, and I think it has a good chance of happening on Thanksgiving night. The Giants allow the second-most deep passing touchdowns this season, and Doctson leads the Skins in deep targets ... There's a very good chance my tombstone reads, ""Here lies Matthew Berry. He believed in Cooper Kupp."" He drives me nuts, and the fumble last week on the way to the end zone didn't help. But here I am, back in, as he should see an increase in targets with Robert Woods on the shelf. Between Woods and Kupp, they have more than 70 percent of the Rams' WR red zone targets. He's on the flex radar in 12-team or deeper PPR leagues, especially if Kenny Vaccaro misses another game.

Wide receivers I hate in Week 12

Dez Bryant, Cowboys: Dez has less than 100 yards in every game this season and just one over 80 yards, and I expect him to get shadow coverage from Casey Hayward. You already know I'm a bit nervous about Dak in this game, and part of the reason is lack of expected production from Dez. The Chargers have allowed just two touchdowns to opposing wide receivers in their past five games and only four receptions on passes 15 yards or deeper in that same time frame, fewest in the league. You have to hope for a score or a bunch of dink-and-dunk stuff to Dez, which could certainly happen, it just doesn't appear likely based on this entire season. I have him just outside my top 20.

Larry Fitzgerald, Cardinals: Insert wide receiver facing the Jaguars here. The Jags have allowed the fewest receptions and receiving yards to slot receivers this year and are one of two teams yet to allow a touchdown to a WR lined up in the slot this season. In fact, in the past four games, they've allowed a TOTAL of nine receptions. Fitz is a Hall of Famer, but this column is about expectations, and it's easy to see why they are much lower this week than normal.

Marvin Jones Jr., Lions: With expected shadow coverage from Xavier Rhodes, Jones should have a quieter game than usual. He had just two receptions for 42 yards in the first meeting with Minnesota back in Week 4. The Vikings have not allowed a 100-yard receiver all season long, and since coming to the Lions, Jones has just seven receptions for 101 yards total in three games against the Vikes. Despite how hot he's been, he's outside my top 20.

Tight ends I love in Week 12

Matthew Berry's Fantasy Life By fantasy players, for fantasy players. As a gift or just for yourself, gear up and show your pride about the game we all love. -- TMR

Evan Engram, Giants: Yeah, last week was ugly. It's about to get better. Since its Week 5 bye, Washington has allowed the most catches to opposing TEs and the second-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. Don't get cute. Engram's an easy top-three play.

Vernon Davis, Redskins: Davis continues to crush it when Jordan Reed is out, and I expect Reed to miss Thursday night as well. Davis is leading all qualified tight ends in yards per reception (15.97) this season and has 30 targets over the past four weeks, third only to Travis Kelce and Jimmy Graham among TEs in that span. And as you may have heard, the Giants have given up a touchdown to a tight end in every game this season except last week, and even then, Kelce still had over 100 yards.

Others receiving votes: Death, taxes and start your tight ends against Cleveland. The Browns have given up the most receptions, second-most touchdowns and third-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends this season. Tyler Kroft, you're up. ... A sure sign of the apocalypse? I'm saying nice things about Jared Cook. Since their Week 5 bye, the Broncos are tied for the second-most catches, most receiving yards and tied for the most receiving touchdowns allowed to opposing TEs.

Tight ends I hate in Week 12

Jason Witten, Cowboys: With just two red zone targets the past four weeks, it's no wonder Witten hasn't scored in that time frame. In fact, he has just one touchdown in the past two months and is averaging less than 30 yards a game. With five or fewer targets in four of his past five, he is unlikely to get back on track against a Chargers team that has allowed just one tight end touchdown this entire season (Rob Gronkowski from 2 yards out). They are also top two in fewest points allowed to tight ends, top five in fewest receptions and top eight in fewest receiving yards.

Cameron Brate, Buccaneers: In each of the past three games (two with Ryan Fitzpatrick, one that was split between Jameis Winston and Fitzy), Brate has just one catch. Just a total of 10 targets, so there doesn't seem to be a connection with Fitzy. When Jimmy Graham got into the end zone last week against the Falcons, he was just the second tight end to do so against Atlanta this season. Brate is unlikely to have a big role in this one.

Defenses to stream in Week 12

Not a great list this week, but here's the best of the lot available in a bunch of leagues ...

New England Patriots (58 percent available): Don't look now, but the Patriots got it figured out. Averaging more than 10 points in their past three games, they are now at home against either Jay Cutler or Matt Moore.

Los Angeles Chargers (48 percent available): Only if Tyron Smith is declared inactive.

Atlanta Falcons (81 percent available): Fitzmagic has been known to turn the ball over occasionally.

Myron MedcalfESPN Staff Writer ,The nation's No. 1 traveled across the country and found themselves down four at the break. But the Blue Devils dominated the final 10 minutes to win.,2017-11-24T01:20:14Z,espn,Duke has to 'wake up' to avoid upset against Portland State,http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/119959/duke-had-to-wake-up-to-avoid-upset-against-portland-state,http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1123%2Fr293596_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Portland State controls the first half, but Marvin Bagley III's double-double of 18 points and 15 rebounds propels Duke to victory in the second half in a 99-81 win. (1:07)

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Mike Krzyzewski seemed relieved after his Duke squad skated past Portland State in the second half of a 99-81 victory at the PK80 tournament on Thursday.

“I thought Portland State played amazingly hard and well,” Krzyzewski said. “They knocked us back.”

The Blue Devils, anchored by Wooden Award candidate Grayson Allen and ESPN’s top-rated recruiting class, had a significant size advantage over the Vikings. But the latter had experience and no fear of the ACC powerhouse.

An upset would have followed a trend. On Wednesday, Division II Chaminade ran California off the floor in a 96-72 win in the Maui Invitational. That same day, NC State upset Arizona, which shot 12 percent from the 3-point line, after Tennessee beat Purdue in overtime, both in the Battle 4 Atlantis.

Duke was in trouble, it seemed, on Thursday.

By halftime, Portland State had amassed a 49-45 lead and hushed the Duke supporters who’d flown to the West Coast to watch America’s No. 1 team. The Vikings made 50 percent of their 3-pointers, hit all eight free-throw attempts and committed just one turnover before the break.

“You know what happens sometimes too when you’re in a tournament? You assume you’re going to play Sunday night -- especially when you’re young, you assume that,” Krzyzewski said. “And [the Vikings did not] assume that. Their game is today, so an older team understands that today is our game, too. It became our game in the second half.”

Grayson Allen made just 2 of 7 shots Thursday and needed his teammates to carry more of the weight. Steve Dykes/Getty Images

Freshmen Marvin Bagley III (18 points, 15 rebounds), Tre Duval (22 points, 7-for-14 shooting) and Wendell Carter Jr. (16 points, 10 rebounds) helped Duke overcome poor shooting efforts by Gary Trent Jr. and Allen -- 4-for-15 combined -- and matched the aggression of Portland State’s veteran players.

Allen and PSU’s Bryce Canda (14 points, 10 rebounds, five assists) drew double technical fouls in the second half for trash talk.

Deontae North led Portland State in scoring (24 points) and technical fouls (two). He drew the first when he appeared to throw a punch at Carter in a fight for a loose ball. He picked up the second down the stretch when he said something that bothered an official while he waited to check into the game. His squad was still locked in a single-digit game against the national-title favorites.

And then, Duke dominated the final 10 minutes against a PSU squad that made just 5 of 19 shots from beyond the arc after the break.

Bagley said his team needed a game like this. The Blue Devils have as much talent as any team in America. But they’ll need more time, Bagley said, to evolve together and grow as a group.

“Going into the second half, it was just, we had to wake up,” Bagley said.","trash talk deontae north

Dave McMenaminESPN Staff Writer ,"At the Cavs' annual ""Big Shots and Little Stars"" fundraiser, the shortest player in the NBA found inspiration in 5-year-old Gavin Heileman, who has been fighting cancer for two years and takes pride in being the shortest person in his class.",2017-11-22T19:28:47Z,espn,The special connection between Isaiah Thomas and 'the bravest boy in the world',http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/21517637/isaiah-thomas-makes-special-connection-young-cancer-patient-cleveland-cavaliers-charity-event,http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1122%2Fr292976_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"LeBron James, Isaiah Thomas and the rest of the Cavaliers describe their experiences at October's Big Shots and Little Stars fundraiser, which benefits the Flashes of Hope and The Children's Tumor Foundation. (1:50)

As 5-year old Gavin Heileman stood at the foot of the stage, minutes from his turn in the spotlight, Isaiah Thomas took Gavin's hand and held it tightly while the pair awaited their cue. Thomas was Gavin's chaperone at the Cleveland Cavaliers' annual ""Big Shots and Little Stars"" fundraiser for the Flashes of Hope charity, and though each player was randomly matched with a child for the evening, there was something about the two that just fit.

""I got little boys, so I know how that is,"" Thomas says. ""He held his hand out, and I just grabbed it.""

Thomas, generously listed at 5-foot-9 and playing a sport that sends scouts literally all over the world to find the tallest athletes, inexplicably found a way to thrive in the NBA's spotlight after being selected with the last pick, No. 60, in the 2011 draft.

Editor's Picks Thomas on drills: 'Hardest I've run' in rehab While Cavaliers point guard Isaiah Thomas said he ""felt good for the most part"" after participating in offensive drills Sunday, he's still not expected back in the lineup until January. Against the Pistons, the Cavs will turn to Jose Calderon.

Isaiah Thomas on health: 'I am not damaged' Isaiah Thomas was forceful in his belief that his injured hip would not have a long-term impact on his career. ""I am not damaged,"" Thomas told ESPN on Tuesday. ""I'll be back, and I'll be the same player."" 1 Related

After a career year with the Boston Celtics last season -- averaging 28.9 points and 5.9 assists in the regular season, then 23.3 points and 6.7 assists in a postseason run that ended with a loss to the Cavs in the conference finals -- Thomas wasn't supposed to be here. Not in Cleveland. Not with a hurt hip. Not in a contract year with millions of dollars on the line.

Gavin wasn't supposed to be here, either. Not with anaplastic astrocytoma. Not two years removed from the discovery of a grade III brain tumor when he was just 3 years old. Not having overcome seizures and chemotherapy and loss of feeling in the right side of his body all before enrolling in elementary school.

Flashes of Hope brought them together. Since it began in Cleveland in 2001, the organization has photographed tens of thousands of kids fighting cancer, capturing a still image of each child to help serve as a confidence booster while they cope with the disease.

This year's ""Big Shots and Little Stars"" -- in Thomas' case, the ""big"" wasn't quite as literal -- raised a record $1.15 million, with 150 volunteers helping to bring the ""Alice in Wonderland"" theme to life. Actors came dressed as characters such as the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts, and the night marked the first time Gavin dressed in a bowtie to complement his three-piece suit. Thomas chided Gavin a bit for his white socks and black shoes combo giving him a Michael Jackson look.

Aside from Thomas' relationship with his sons -- 5-year-old Jaiden and 7-year-old James -- naturally drawing him to Gavin, there was another commonality between the two.

""I'm one of the shortest kids in my class, but that's fine with me,"" Gavin said. ""I like it.""

""You like it?"" Thomas said, his face lighting up. ""Being small is so cool. I'm the smallest guy in the NBA. I'm the smallest guy in basketball, so we're like the same guy.""

""Yeah,"" Gavin said, nodding his head.

""It's not always fun to be tall,"" Thomas said.

What was fun was their time together, talking about Gavin's favorite movie (""Cars"") and making their way down a fashion runway that spanned the floor of Quicken Loans Arena, where the Cavs' court usually is, as the 1,300 guests snapped photos.

After the runway, Thomas and Gavin were interviewed by Cavs play-by-play announcer Fred McLeod. Thomas stood behind Gavin with his hands on the boy's shoulders. While Thomas was speaking, Gavin reached up and wrapped his hand around one of Thomas' fingers.

""I'm not a huge crier, and I just started bawling because you could just tell that Gavin felt so comfortable with Isaiah,"" said Cameron Heileman, Gavin's mother.

The experience left an impression on Gavin.

""The entire car ride home, he was just super, super ... I don't even know how to explain it. Just like a kid I've never seen before,"" Cameron said. ""He was just so excited about everything.""

After the event, Gavin's kindergarten class greeted him at school with a sign that read ""Swishes come true."" The Heileman family hosts parties to watch Cavs games, and Gavin dutifully puts on a headband like the one Thomas wears when he plays. Even though Thomas hasn't played in a game for the Cavs because of his hip injury, Gavin gazes at the television, hoping to get a glimpse of the point guard on the bench.

Isaiah Thomas told Gavin Heileman, who has been battling cancer for two years, ""Being small is so cool. ... I’m the smallest guy in basketball, so we’re like the same guy."" Dave McMenamin/ESPN

""Ever since that night, it's been, 'My friend Isaiah. I have to watch my friend Isaiah on TV,'"" Cameron said. ""It's just been the cutest thing. It's a time where he can just watch his friend, and we don't think about anything.""

Gavin's final chemo session is Dec. 18. The tumor has been completely removed. The seizures have ceased. He's the appropriate height and weight for a healthy 5-year-old boy (even if he says he's short for his class). The feeling has returned to the right side of his body. He doesn't show any signs of trouble with his fine motor skills, nor has he struggled with any learning disabilities.

When Cameron told her son he'd be an honored guest at ""Big Shots and Little Stars,"" he reasoned, ""Well, mom, it's because I'm the bravest boy in the world.""

She wasn't about to argue with him.

""When this whole thing started, he was 3, and he was swallowing pills whole,"" she said. ""He was sitting completely still while he was getting radiation. I mean, completely still. When he's on chemo, he's very sick, and I think none of that has gotten him down, and you would have no idea that he's sick at all. He's just so brave.""

And he's happy, too.

""Ever since that night, it's been, 'My friend Isaiah. I have to watch my friend Isaiah on TV.'"" Cameron Heileman, Gavin's mother

""People like the Cavs and Isaiah taking time out to help him, I truly think that his happiness and his joy [helps him] just as much as the chemo and the radiation,"" said Cameron, who also credited the Cleveland Clinic for their treatment of Gavin.

Meanwhile, the 5-year-old helped the 28-year-old realize that as much as he's itching to get back on the court, being a dad to Jaiden and James while they're still carefree is about as good as it gets.

""These kids come here so happy, and they've been through so much in their lives when you wouldn't even think they have,"" Thomas said. ""These events are always special to me because they're smiling, they're happy where they've been through tough times. Like, I have half the worries they have, and they're still smiling. That helps me out when I'm going through tough times. It's like, people are going through worse things than I am, and they're still pushing through. So these kids are everything. These kids are what keep me going.""","hope charity allan buxtoncleveland cavaliers

Who else makes the list?",2017-11-23T12:00:43Z,espn,The NFL's top Thanksgiving performances: Remember that time...,http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/258460/top-nfl-thanksgiving-day-performances-303-receiving-yards-and-more,http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1121%2Fr292291_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"There was a time, not too long ago in fact, when it was a special occasion for the NFL to play on Thursdays. It happened only on Thanksgiving, usually with games in Detroit and Dallas, and over time the event provided some of the greatest individual performances in NFL history.

As we prepare for the 2017 version, let's take a closer look at 10 of them. Research was aided by the database at Pro Football Reference and (mostly) limited to games played after the 1970 NFL/AFL merger.

1976: 273 yards for O.J. Simpson

In his seventh season with the Buffalo Bills, and two years removed from his 2,003-yard season, Simpson broke his own NFL record for rushing yards in a game. His longest run was a 48-yard touchdown in the third quarter of the Bills' 27-14 loss to the Detroit Lions. The NFL record stood for a year, until it was broken by the Chicago Bears' Walter Payton, and it now stands at No. 6 on the all-time list.

1945: Jim Benton has 303 receiving yards

Playing for the Cleveland Rams, Benton became the first professional football player to eclipse 300 receiving yards in a 28-21 victory over the Lions. He caught 10 passes from Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Waterfield, including a 70-yard touchdown, and for good measure had an interception while playing defense. The yardage record stood for 40 years and remains one of only four 300-yard receiving games in NFL history, a notable achievement given how the game has evolved in the modern era.

1994: Dave Krieg's perfect passer rating

Having replaced injured Lions starter Scott Mitchell earlier in the season, Krieg completed 20 of 25 passes for 351 yards and three touchdowns, without an interception, in a 35-21 victory over the Bills. Based on the perfect 158.3 passer rating, at least, it was the best game of his career. (There have been 52 perfect passer ratings in NFL history, based on at least 10 attempts.) Krieg, 36 at the time, led the Lions to a 5-2 record and a spot in the NFC playoffs. He would go on to play for three more teams as a backup before retiring after the 1998 season.

2010: Tom Brady matches Krieg

Brady completed 21 of 27 passes for 341 yards and four touchdowns in the New England Patriots' 45-24 rout of the Lions. The Patriots actually trailed 24-17 midway through the third quarter before Brady threw three touchdown passes -- of 79 and 22 yards to Deion Branch, and 16 yards to Wes Welker -- in the span of 13 minutes, 30 seconds. It is one of two games that Brady has achieved a perfect passer rating. The other: A six-touchdown performance against the Miami Dolphins in 2007.

1977: Bob Griese throws 6 touchdown passes

Griese tied an NFL record at the time for scoring throws, which included three to Nat Moore, in the Miami Dolphins' 55-14 demolition of the St. Louis Cardinals. The game was played at St. Louis' Busch Stadium, on a 39-degree day that wouldn't have been predictive of such a scoring output. Griese made a total of 151 regular-season starts in his Hall of Fame career. This game was one of four in which he threw more than three touchdown passes.

2004: Peyton Manning matches Griese

Manning also threw six touchdown passes in a Thanksgiving game, this one a 41-9 victory for the Indianapolis Colts over the Lions. The scores accounted for more than a quarter of his 23 completions and represented one of nine games in which he threw at least five touchdown passes. He shares the current NFL record for scoring passes in a game (seven) with Nick Foles, and owns the record for career touchdown passes (539).

1998: Randy Moss catches three (long) touchdowns

As he continued his breakout rookie season, Moss caught touchdown passes of 51, 56 and 56 yards in the Minnesota Vikings' 46-36 victory over the Cowboys. They were his only catches of the game. The performance was one of six occasions in post-merger history when a player amassed at least 160 yards on three or fewer catches. No player has ever caught more than three touchdown passes on Thanksgiving, and Moss' 163 receiving yards ranks seventh among all turkey day performances.

1998: Troy Aikman throws for 455 yards to keep up

Down 21-6 to the Vikings thanks in large part to Moss, the Cowboys were in catch-up mode for most of this game. That led Aikman to set a Thanksgiving Day record, and establish a career high for passing yards. It was the only 400-yard game of his Hall of Fame career, and it came on a personal record for attempts (57) and completions (34). He managed only one touchdown pass, however, and the Cowboys never got closer than 10 points after the 21-6 deficit.

1979: Earl Campbell rumbles for 195 yards

Campbell was in his second season with the Houston Oilers when he made his only Thanksgiving appearance, and it was memorable. Even after logging 264 carries through the Oilers' first 12 games, Campbell ran 33 times for 195 yards, second only to Simpson's 273 yards on Thanksgiving, and two touchdowns in a 30-24 victory over the Cowboys. One of the scores came on a 61-yard run. This game was one of 20 in which Campbell had at least 30 carries.

2015: Ziggy Ansah has 3.5 sacks

Ansah was a singular terror to Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Mark Sanchez in the Lions' 45-14 victory. He also exacted a measure of draft-day revenge, doing most of his damage against offensive tackle Lane Johnson -- whom the Eagles drafted one spot above him in 2013. (Johnson, now one of the NFL's best tackles, might have gotten the final laugh over Ansah, who has faded over the past two seasons.) Ansah remains one of two players to record more than three sacks in a Thanksgiving Day game, along with the Cowboys' Eric Ogbogu in 2004.","oj simpson despite oj

You know what really takes the edge off on National Simmering Family Tension Day? Giving a good, old-fashioned football beatdown before dinner. Our X's and O's guru draws up the plays that will help you bury your loved ones in the backyard.

The Home Run

ESPN

Down by a score and need a sure-fire touchdown? This vertical home run route will help you take a shot over the top. Send your sister and best friend down the field on the outside post routes with your brother-in-law -- the one who was an all-conference receiver in high school -- on the wheel route. That's going to create a natural pick situation for the coverage. Underneath, your 50-year-old uncle -- the all-time center, of course -- releases on a quick checkdown. With a ""5 Mississippi"" rush, you have time for the wheel route to come open. Set your feet, and drop a dime for the score.

Rocket Reverse

ESPN

This quick-hitting gadget play allows you to expose an overaggressive defense. Align your cousin and best friend in a stack look, and put your sister in the backfield. At the snap, the lead receiver blocks the first defender on the line with your best friend running the rocket screen, a high-percentage throw. That's where the fun begins. Once your best friend catches the rock, he flips it to your sister releasing from the backfield. With the defense playing out of control and driving on the screen, the sideline is wide open. Secure the ball, and make a house call for six.

Option Pass

ESPN

This is a true run-pass option. Out of the gun alignment, your brother-in-law takes the snap from your uncle and runs the speed option with your sister at tailback. This creates a 2-on-1 against the first defender outside of the box. Make the read, right? Keep or pitch. That's it. But don't forget about the option to throw it with your best friend on the outside fade and your cousin working back on the deep crosser. If the outside coverage player reads run, your brother-in-law can take a shot down the field. Hey, this is modern football -- in the backyard.

Goal-Line Follow Route

ESPN

Dial this up when you need to score at the goal line. This play creates a traffic jam to get a receiver open on the goal line. Aligned in a bunch formation, your best friend clears out on a corner route with your sister coming underneath on the crosser. This allows your cousin -- the one with real route-running skills -- to release outside and break back on the pivot. If the defense somehow makes it through the wash, the pivot should still be there. Gotta sell the release. As a last resort, you can always target your uncle on the backside corner route. Put it up high. And let him climb the ladder to finish.","brotherinlaw

"Michael S. Schmidt, Matt Apuzzo and Maggie Haberman","Lawyers for Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, are said to have terminated an information-sharing agreement with the president’s legal team.",2017-11-23T21:26:47+00:00,google-news,A Split From Trump Indicates That Flynn Is Moving to Cooperate With Mueller,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/politics/flynn-mueller-russia-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/24/us/24-flynn/merlin_129715607_282ab574-d5be-41d7-91ed-643f78199e88-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Lawyers for Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump declined to comment. The four people briefed on the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

A deal with Mr. Flynn would give Mr. Mueller a behind-the-scenes look at the Trump campaign and the early tumultuous weeks of the administration. Mr. Flynn was an early and important adviser to Mr. Trump, an architect of Mr. Trump’s populist “America first” platform and an advocate of closer ties with Russia.

His ties to Russia predated the campaign — he sat with President Vladimir V. Putin at a 2015 event in Moscow — and he was a point person on the transition team for dealing with Russia.

The White House had been bracing for charges against Mr. Flynn in recent weeks, particularly after charges were filed against three other former Trump associates: Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman; Rick Gates, a campaign aide; and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser.

But none of those men match Mr. Flynn in stature, or in his significance to Mr. Trump. A retired three-star general, Mr. Flynn was an early supporter of Mr. Trump’s and a valued surrogate for a candidate who had no foreign policy experience. Mr. Trump named him national security adviser, he said, to help “restore America’s leadership position in the world.”

Among the interactions that Mr. Mueller is investigating is a private meeting that Mr. Flynn had with the Russian ambassador and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, during the presidential transition. In the past year, it has been revealed that people with ties to Russia repeatedly sought to meet with Trump campaign officials, sometimes dangling the promise of compromising information on Mrs. Clinton.

Mr. Flynn is regarded as loyal to Mr. Trump, but he has in recent weeks expressed serious concerns to friends that prosecutors will bring charges against his son, Michael Flynn Jr., who served as his father’s chief of staff and was a part of several financial deals involving the elder Mr. Flynn that Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing.

The White House has said that neither Mr. Flynn nor other former aides have incriminating information to provide about Mr. Trump. “He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel,” a White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said in an interview last month with The New York Times. “I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments. But to the extent that that happens, that’s beyond his control.”

Mr. Flynn was supposed to have been the cornerstone of Mr. Trump’s national security team. Instead, he was forced out after a month in office over his conversations with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn’s handling of those conversations fueled suspicion that people around Mr. Trump had concealed their dealings with Russians, worsening a controversy that has hung over the president’s first year in office.

Four days after Mr. Trump was sworn in, the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Flynn at the White House about his calls with the ambassador. American intelligence and law enforcement agencies became so concerned about Mr. Flynn’s conversations and false statements about them to Vice President Mike Pence that the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that Mr. Flynn might be compromised.

The conversations with the Russian ambassador that led to Mr. Flynn’s undoing took place during the presidential transition. When questions about them surfaced, Mr. Flynn told Mr. Pence that they had exchanged only holiday greetings — the conversations happened in late December, around the time that the Obama administration was announcing sanctions against Russia.

While Mr. Pence and White House press officers repeated the holiday-greetings claim publicly, Mr. Flynn and the ambassador had in fact discussed the sanctions. That invited the idea that the incoming administration was trying to undermine the departing president and curry favor with Moscow.

Mr. Trump sought Mr. Flynn’s resignation only after news broke that Mr. Flynn had been interviewed by F.B.I. agents and that Ms. Yates had warned the White House that his false statements could make him vulnerable to Russian blackmail.

Since then, Mr. Flynn’s legal problems have grown. It was revealed that he failed to list payments from Russia-linked entities on financial disclosure forms. He did not mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia.

The former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, has testified before Congress that Mr. Trump asked him to end the government’s investigation into Mr. Flynn in a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office the day after Mr. Flynn was fired. Mr. Trump’s request caused great concern for Mr. Comey, who immediately wrote a memo about his meeting with the president.

And investigators working for Mr. Mueller have questioned witnesses about whether Mr. Flynn was secretly paid by the Turkish government during the presidential campaign. Mr. Flynn belatedly disclosed, after leaving the White House, that the Turkish government had paid him more than $500,000.

Mr. Flynn’s firing was, in some ways, the first domino that set off a cascade of problems for Mr. Trump. After the president ousted Mr. Comey, news surfaced that the president had requested an end to the Flynn inquiry, a revelation that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. That, in turn, raised the profile of an investigation that the president had tried mightily to contain.","view all new york times

Fox News,A manhunt is underway in Texas after a Trooper with the Department of Public Safety was shot and killed on a highway near the city of Fairfield.,2017-11-24T01:27:46+00:00,google-news,Texas manhunt underway for suspect in fatal cop shooting,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/23/texas-manhunt-underway-for-suspect-in-fatal-cop-shooting.html,//a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2017/11/23/texas-manhunt-underway-for-suspect-in-fatal-cop-shooting/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1511486275482.jpg?ve=1,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The suspect in the fatal shooting of a Texas trooper with the Department of Public Safety was captured after an hours-long manhunt on Thursday.

Officials in Limestone and Freestone counties conducted a massive, hours-long search for the suspect, Darbrett Black, who fled the scene of the shooting in a grey Chevy Malibu. He was arrested in a neighboring county after a stand-off with law enforcement.

""Suspect in today’s fatal TXDPS trooper shooting in Freestone County has been captured in Waller County near Prairie View. Excellent operation by numerous agencies to take this suspect into custody with no additional casualties,"" the Navarro County Office of Emergency Management said on Twitter.

According to police scanner traffic, two women may have also been in the suspect's vehicle when the shooting happened, says a report on KBTX.com.

The Texas Department of Public Safety said on Twitter that the shooting occurred before 4 p.m. Thursday on Interstate 45 south of Fairfield, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Dallas. The agency said the suspect shot and killed the trooper with a rifle during a traffic stop. The suspect then fled the scene.

The trooper has not been identified.

Hours later, the Waller County Sheriff's Office said the suspect's vehicle was spotted in Hempstead, more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Fairfield. Waller County authorities said shots were fired, but did not indicate who opened fire.

Authorities from multiple agencies were able to end a brief standoff, subduing the suspect and placing him under arrest.

Online jail records show that Black was last booked into the Smith County jail in Tyler on September 7, 2017 on charges of evading arrest, aggravated assault of a public servant and reckless driving, according to KBTX.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has released a statement that says: ""I am saddened to hear of the tragic death of a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper killed today in Freestone County. This trooper died selflessly serving Texas.”

Governor Greg Abbott also released a statement on Thursday evening during the height of the manhunt.

""With heavy hearts on this Thanksgiving, Cecilia and I express our most sincere condolences to the family, colleagues and friends of the trooper who was callously killed today in the line of duty,"" he said in the statement. ""…The killer will face justice, and the State of Texas will continue to offer our unwavering support for the men and women in law enforcement who keep our communities safe.""

Thursday’s shooting marked the second in the line duty death for the Texas DPS.

Senior Trooper Thomas Nipper, 62, was conducting a traffic stop on the southbound shoulder of I-35 in Temple at approximately 3:05 p.m. on Saturday, November 4 when his patrol unit was struck from behind by a Chevrolet pickup, according to Fox 7 Austin.

But questions are emerging as to whether the Navy is up to challenges it faces in the Pacific,2017-11-23T14:12:00+00:00,google-news,Can the world's mightiest naval fleet survive the perfect storm?,http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/23/politics/us-navy-seventh-fleet-breaking-point/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171122171123-us-navy-banner-super-tease.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Three US Navy aircraft carriers -- the largest, most sophisticated warships in history -- assembled off the Korean Peninsula, in a move timed to coincide with US President Donald Trump's first official visit to the region.

But behind the dramatic show of force, questions are emerging as to whether the US Navy is up to the challenges it faces in the Pacific -- from both a nuclear-armed North Korea and a strengthening China -- at a time when its top leaders acknowledge it lacks the money, manpower and weapons to ensure success. And when a massive corruption scandal threatens the ranks of dozens of its top officers.

The three-carrier exercise, conducted in early November with South Korean and Japanese warships, was just one of about 160 multilateral and bilateral exercises performed this year in the area of operations overseen by the Navy's 7th Fleet, a Navy spokesperson told CNN. That's about one exercise every two days.

And the tempo of operations isn't slowing.

The aircraft carriers USS Ronald Reagan and USS Carl Vinson steam with their strike groups and ships from Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force during bilateral training in June.

Stretched too thin?

Just two days after the three carriers -- the USS Ronald Reagan, USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Nimitz, and their multi-ship strike groups -- wrapped up four days of war games off Korea, the USS Ronald Reagan, with its air wing and three guided-missile destroyers, began a 10-day exercise with Japanese naval units off Okinawa.

While the US exercises are intended to reassure Asian allies and to show North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the United States will not be intimidated by Pyongyang's testing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, the moves also highlight concerns that the 7th Feet is being stretched too thin.

The toll of operations in the Pacific has been grim this year.

Two US guided-missile destroyers, USS Fitzgerald and USS John S McCain, suffered collisions with merchant ships, leaving 17 US sailors dead and the two warships needing hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs.

The accidents, off Japan and Singapore respectively, also left the Navy wondering how two of the most sophisticated ships on the seas couldn't even navigate crowded shipping lanes.

In total, the 7th Fleet has clocked up five major non-combat incidents in 2017 involving ships and an additional two involving aircraft, including Wednesday's crash in the Philippine Sea of a plane taking personnel to the Reagan.

Jan-31 Tuesday 31 January:

USS Antietam runs aground in Tokyo Bay The USS Antietam, a guided-missile cruiser, damaged its propellers and spilled hydraulic oil into the water after running aground while the ship was anchoring in Tokyo Bay. May-9 Tuesday 9 May:

USS Lake Champlain collides with South Korean fishing boat The guided-missile cruiser was struck by a 60- to 70-foot-long South Korean fishing boat while conducting operations in international waters near the Korean Peninsula, the Navy said. June-17 Saturday 17 June:

USS Fitzgerald collides with Philippine cargo ship The collision between the Fitzgerald, a guided-missile destroyer, and the ACX Crystal on June 17 claimed the lives of seven US sailors. It took place 56 nautical miles off the coast of Honshu, Japan, in an area heavily traveled by commercial shipping. Aug-21 Monday 21 August:

USS John S McCain collides with oil tanker off Singapore The US guided-missile destroyer collided with a Liberian oil tanker in crowded shipping lanes off Singapore, leaving 10 US sailors dead and five more injured. The accident left a large highly visible hole in the US ship. Nov-18 Saturday 18 November:

USS Benfold struck by Japanese tugboat The guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold was struck by a Japanese tugboat while participating in a scheduled towing exercise off Japan. The tug boat lost propulsion and drifted into the US ship, the Navy said. No one was injured.

A US Government Accountability Office report from September warned lengthy deployments of US ships based in Japan -- as both the Fitzgerald and McCain had been at the time of their collisions -- often result in key training requirements being neglected due to the demands of operational duties, something the report describes as a ""problem.""

Without training time, ""perishable skills atrophy,"" said Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor who spent 10 years ""driving"" US warships.

""Military commands are like a football team, you constantly have to practice,"" added Schuster.

Appearing before the House Armed Services Committee as part of an investigation into the series of fatal crashes and collisions at sea, the Navy's No. 2 officer, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William Moran, said the Navy is trying to do too much with too little.

""We continue to have a supply-and-demand problem which is placing a heavy strain on the force,"" said Moran.

All of these things culminate with this notion we aren't big enough to do everything we're being tasked to do Vice Chief of US Naval Operations Adm. William Moran

""All of these things culminate with this notion we aren't big enough to do everything we're being tasked to do,"" Moran added. ""And our culture is, 'we're going to get it done,' because that's what the Navy is all about. And sometimes our culture works against us.""

It's an opinion shared throughout the naval establishment, where frustrations are mounting as to the rising set of operational demands placed on the 7th Fleet.

In a testimony delivered to Congress in September, John Pendleton, director of defense capabilities and management in the Government Accountability Office (GAO), said the Navy was operating on what people in the service call a 'train on the margins' approach.

That means ships had no dedicated training time but instead fit whatever they could into time on missions, said Pendleton.

Exhausted crews can make bad decisions. As Schuster points out, in the case of the Fitzgerald collision, officers on watch did not wake the sleeping captain when the warship got in range of the merchant vessel.

""They were either incredibly complacent or sloppy beyond description,"" said Schuster.

The Navy has launched multiple investigations, a safety pause, and reviews in the wake of the recent accidents.

During an appearance at the House Armed Services Committee hearing in September, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer said the reviews will include a chief of naval operations-led ""comprehensive review"" that will ""take a look at the tactical and operational situation"" as well as a departmental ""strategic readiness review"" that he said will involve ""an independent team comprised of military and industry experts that will look and examine root causes, accountability, long-term systemic issues, and then provide remedial insight.""

""We are taking immediate corrective actions to ensure we meet the training and material readiness standard to prevent another mishap,"" Richardson said.

The Navy has also taken several personnel actions, including sacking the commanders of the Fitzgerald and the McCain, several other senior officers, as well as the commander of 7th Fleet, Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, the first time a fleet commander has been relieved of duty in the history of the US Navy.

Aucoin, who had been commander of the fleet since September 2015, was dismissed ""due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command.""

The Navy's internal report on the Fitzgerald and McCain collisions, released in early November, said cutting corners to meet demands on 7th Fleet ships had become the norm.

""The risks that were taken in the Western Pacific accumulated over time, and did so insidiously,"" the report said. ""The dynamic environment normalized to the point where individuals and groups of individuals could no longer recognize that the processes in place to identify and assess readiness were no longer working at the ship and headquarters level.""

Surveys of sailors aboard the Japan-based guided-missile cruiser USS Shiloh carried out between June 2015 and August this year point to severe morale problems.

One sailor described serving aboard the ship as being akin to being on ""a floating prison,"" according to surveys obtained via the Freedom of Information Act by Navy Times

The survey responses, which run into the hundreds of pages and list a variety of complaints, including suicidal thoughts and despair, also show that junior sailors were concerned about receiving harsh punishments from the Shiloh's then-commander, Capt. Adam M. Aycoc, including being placed in the brig and fed only ""bread and water.""

""Even the taxi drivers on base know us for being the 'USS Bread and Water,'"" one survey respondent said.

Pressure mounting

Top commanders acknowledge the Navy may be asking too much of its sailors, ships and aircraft.

Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee earlier this month, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker, commander of the US naval air forces, detailed the extraordinary lengths the Navy now has to go to send fully equipped carrier air groups to sea, due to the low stocks of working equipment -- including fighter jets and trained personnel.

""To get Carl Vinson, Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt ready to deploy in January, June and October of this year, and equip their embarked air wings with the required number of mission capable jets, 94 strike fighters had to be transferred, to and from the maintenance depots, or between F-18 squadrons on both coasts,"" said Shoemaker.

While this exercise is encouraging, the reality remains that our Navy is underfunded, over-tasked, and too small. US Sen. John McCain

In September, Moran said hundreds of parts were cannibalized from some F/A-18s and used on others to get carrier-based squadrons combat ready.

One congressional aide told CNN that having to reshuffle 94 fighters to equip three carriers is ""crazy.""

The problem also directly impacted the sailors and pilots aboard those ships as the Navy was forced to fill gaps in those deploying squadrons and the three carriers by temporarily reassigning more than 300 sailors or extending their deployments beyond normal lengths, Shoemaker said.

Such moves, which Shoemaker called a strike fighter ""shell game,"" hurt morale, meaning personnel don't sign up to extend their Navy careers, leaving positions open and years of training and experience wasted.

Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, applauded the Navy for conducting exercises with three carriers near the Korean Peninsula but also highlighted several of the shortfalls plaguing the service.

""Too often exercises like this, which are critical to maintaining tactical proficiency, are sacrificed due to higher priority operations, maintenance delays, or fiscal constraints,"" McCain said in a written statement.

""While this exercise is encouraging, the reality remains that our Navy is underfunded, over-tasked, and too small,"" he said.

Navy commanders have previously warned that years of spending cuts have limited the number of usable aircraft and ships -- an issue that has only escalated amid increasing demands for US military presence.

For the Navy's 7th Fleet -- the largest of the Navy's numbered fleets -- that means staying on watch for North Korean provocations, including having ships on the ready that could shoot down ballistic missiles headed for Japan, Guam or even the mainland United States. Those ships included the Fitzgerald, John S McCain and Shiloh.

It also includes freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, where the Beijing government has been building man-made islands , installing fortifications to strengthen territorial claims, and deploying new ships and planes that challenge a long-time US technological edge.

And then there are exercises with an I ndian military eager for US help in increasing its naval capabilities, watching Russian nuclear-armed submarines deploy from that nation's eastern ports into the Pacific, and making port calls from Australia to Vietnam to show the US flag and maintain an American presence.

In total, the 7th Fleet's area of operation spans more than 124 million square kilometers, stretching from the International Date Line to the India-Pakistan border; and from the Kuril Islands in the North to Antarctica in the south.

We can build up our navy to a level where it can do all of these things without wearing out crews and hardware, or we can 'pivot' or 're-balance' more of our forces to the Pacific theater. James R. Holmes, professor of strategy, US Naval War College

In regard to China, in particular, neither the Obama nor the Trump administrations has shifted forces to the Pacific in sufficient enough numbers or capability, said James R. Holmes, professor of strategy at the US Naval War College.

""China has come to this commonsense realization, and understands that it can grind down adversary sea services just by being active in its 'near seas,' mainly the China seas,"" said Holmes. ""Imposing a swift 'optempo' on your opponent, meaning keeping him on the go all the time, wearies him over time. And while that hasn't been a direct cause of this year's mishaps, it does contribute to crew fatigue, cut down on training time, and thus exacerbate the factors our navy cited in its recent collision reports.""

In response, the Navy has two options, said Holmes. ""We can build up our navy to a level where it can do all of these things without wearing out crews and hardware, or we can 'pivot' or 're-balance' more of our forces to the Pacific theater.""

Holmes points out that while large, the 7th Fleet represents only a part of the US Navy. ""If we can no longer overpower opponents in both the Atlantic and Pacific, then we need to make some hard choices about where to apply the bulk of our effort -- and accept that that means accepting risk in the other theater.""

F/A-18 Hornets fly off the carrier USS Carl Vinson off the Korean Peninsula in March. US officials say they've had to scavenge parts to keep the F/A-18s flyable.

Corruption scandal

The Navy's operational problems can be tackled, argue experts. But that is without contending with the biggest corruption scandal in US naval history.

The ongoing scandal has seen 20 current and former Navy officials charged so far in a fraud and bribery investigation stretching across Asia.

Known as the so-called ""Fat Leonard"" scandal, the investigation centers on former defense contractor Leonard Glenn ""Fat Leonard"" Francis, whose company provided services to Navy ships including fuel and tugboats.

Since the investigation began in 2013, multiple Navy officials have been arrested and accused of accepting cash, prostitutes and all-expenses-paid trips in exchange for steering ships to ports where Francis' company operated.

In June, Michael Brooks, who served as the US naval attaché at the US Embassy in the Philippines from 2006 to 2008, was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison after admitting to using his influence to benefit Francis in exchange for ""bribes of travel and entertainment expenses, hotel rooms and the services of prostitutes,"" the Justice Department said.

The Washington Post reported in early November that the Navy is reviewing the actions of 440 more active-duty and retired personnel in connections with the scandal. According to the report, sixty current and former admirals are included in the review.

In an article published earlier this month by Stars and Stripes , Capt. Michael Junge, a military professor at the US Naval War College, linked the scandal to wider, more systemic problems. ""There's no way you could have as much churn as Fat Leonard caused in the last few years in 7th Fleet and have it not impact what's been going on,"" said Junge. ""You just can't separate it.""

The US 7th Fleet this year has participated in about 160 exercises with other countries, including this one with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force.

The coming storm

The US Pacific Fleet was first established in 1907, though it can trace its origins back much further to the formation of the Pacific Squadron in 1821. Since then, it has seen its size grow in line with its overall strategic importance, as Asia -- and East Asia in particular -- became a focal point of US foreign policy.

But the goal also means keeping what's in the fleet in working order -- and that's no easy task.

Maintenance delays are currently sidelining 11 Navy ships, a congressional aide told CNN.

A September report from the Government Accountability Office found that the Navy's shipyard facilities and equipment in poor condition with a backlog of restoration and maintenance that will take at least 19 years to clear.

Lawmakers have often cited budget caps implemented by Congress and President Barack Obama in 2011, coupled with the high demand for the fleet's services, as key factors contributing to the Navy's lack of fiscal flexibility,"" the report said.

""Inadequate facilities and equipment led to maintenance delays that contributed in part to more than 1,300 lost operational days — days when ships were unavailable for operations — for aircraft carriers and 12,500 lost operational days for submarines,"" according to the report.

The littoral combat ship USS Coronado fires a Harpoon missile during Exercise Pacific Griffin, conducted with the Singaporean navy.

In early November, the House of Representatives passed an annual defense policy bill that -- if passed by the Senate -- would authorize the full ship maintenance budget requested by the Navy and provide additional funding for more aircraft.

""This year's National Defense Authorization Act will help address this problem by increasing funding for the Navy, including authorizing five additional ships and hundreds of millions of dollars for maintenance above and beyond the President's budget request,"" McCain said in a statement.

But while the defense bill is a move in the right direction, the funding authorized won't fix the readiness problem -- an issue that will take years to address, according to Randy Forbes, a former US representative who served as chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee.

""This is not a spigot you can turn on and off,"" Forbes said, referring to defense funding. ""If we get into a conflict you will fight with what you have so it is important to project out what you need.""

And while Forbes recognized the Navy's need to flex its muscle through exercises like those conducted near Korea, he said the US must address the fleet's ""diminishing surge capacity"" as a potential conflict will likely require a response by more than three carriers to carry out the operations plan.

To ensure its carrier strike groups are able to respond to an emerging conflict, the US must launch a course to ""rebuild the Navy,"" Forbes told CNN.

""The current math won't work,"" Forbes said. ""It's going to take an overall rebuilding of the Navy to meet the challenges around the globe.""","japanbased guidedmissile cruiser uss shiloh

Emily Cochrane,President Trump spent his holiday indulging in some of his favorite habits: spending time at his properties and talking about all the winning he’s doing.,2017-11-24T01:36:54+00:00,google-news,A Mar-a-Lago Thanksgiving: It’s All Gravy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-thanksgiving.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/24/us/24dc-thanksgiving/24dc-thanksgiving-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"“We’re being talked about again as an armed forces,” he said as a few club members lingered outside. “We’re really winning. We know how to win. But we have to let you win. They weren’t letting you win before.”

He continued extolling the victories during a second event at a Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach. The first lady, Melania Trump, joined him to hand out sandwiches in the station’s mess hall. The first couple had also provided assortments of fruit, muffins and cookies to the service members, some of whom were about to go out on patrol.

Mr. Trump, the master marketer, spoke of the Coast Guard in terms few presidents have used. “I think that there is no brand — of any kind, I’m not just talking about a military branch — that has gone up more than the Coast Guard,” Mr. Trump told the service members, citing what he described as the organization’s successful response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria this year. “Incredible people, you’ve done an incredible job, and I love coming here and doing this for you today.”

He noted orders for new military equipment, including Coast Guard cutters, Navy ships and Air Force planes, including one that is “almost like an invisible fighter.”

The president then returned to old holiday habits, leaving to spend a few hours at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach before returning to Mar-a-Lago, the club he owns, in an unusual fall rain.

The menu was to include traditional fare — turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes with marshmallows — as well as local produce, red snapper, Florida stone crab and a variety of baked goods, cakes and pies, according to a summary provided by Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady.

Mr. Trump’s time at Mar-a-Lago and his surrounding golf courses was not, the White House told reporters, merely leisure, but was filled with meetings and phone calls, a schedule that Mr. Trump emphasized on Twitter on Wednesday.

“Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago),” he wrote on Twitter before spending a few hours at his West Palm Beach golf course. Officials declined to say with whom the president spoke.

In the years since Mr. Trump renovated Mar-a-Lago, the former estate of the cereal company heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, into an upscale club and resort, he has relished spending parts of the holiday season there, said Anthony P. Senecal, Mr. Trump’s former butler, who worked at the resort for more than 20 years. This visit was the president’s first to the club since April.

“He’s coming home,” Mr. Senecal said in an interview. “He’s going to be overjoyed that he’s at Mar-a-Lago, that he’s near the golf course, that he’s going to see a lot of friends that he hasn’t seen in a great while.”

While the living room Christmas tree and menorah are usually not up yet, the week of Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the Mar-a-Lago holiday season, after the club’s annual summer closing for repairs and historic restoration, Mr. Senecal said.

Families congregate to enjoy the traditional Thanksgiving fare, and Mr. Trump generally circles the room, which is decorated with seasonal flowers, to greet the club members, who pay thousands of dollars for membership. The president, Mr. Senecal recalled, prefers white turkey meat, mashed potatoes and gravy, and usually his signature two scoops of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.

“Thanksgiving is a joyous time,” said Mr. Senecal, who said he had declined a Thanksgiving invitation this year because of medical issues. (Last year, Mr. Trump called Mr. Senecal “obviously a very troubled man” after the discovery of Facebook posts in which Mr. Senecal had called for the execution of Barack Obama.) “There’s never been any other place. Wouldn’t know what to compare it to.”

It is unclear how different the social season at the club will be this year, especially after several charities canceled events over the president’s response to the racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, Va., according to The Washington Post. But Peter Brock, a local real estate developer and a member of the club who has spent parts of the holiday season there in the past, said Mr. Trump’s ascendancy to the presidency had only elevated his star presence on the grounds.

“The bottom line is, he is always enthusiastic about coming home and seeing what he calls his people,” Mr. Brock said. “And for the most part, we are his people.”

But holiday or not, Mr. Trump is not one to pass up an opportunity to deliver a jab. In 2013, he offered these greetings on Twitter: “Happy Thanksgiving to all — even the haters and losers!” And on Thursday, he took aim at some of his favorite targets: the reporters trailing him for the duration of his Florida stay.

“I’ll ask the press to get out, and I’ll say, ‘You’re fired,’” Mr. Trump said as reporters were ushered out of the Mar-a-Lago teleconference. “And, by the way, media, happy Thanksgiving, I must say.”","heiress marjorie merriweather post

Uma Thurman wants to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving — everyone except Harvey Weinstein, that is.

""Happy Thanksgiving Everyone! (Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators — I’m glad it’s going slowly — you don’t deserve a bullet),"" she wrote in a post on her Instagram Thursday. She ended her post by saying, ""stay tuned.""

The actress has worked with Weinstein — who has been accused by more than 90 women of sexual assault, harassment and rape — on multiple films including the Kill Bill franchise and Pulp Fiction.

Thurman has yet to officially offer a statement on Weinstein, but made waves online earlier this month when, in an interview with Access Hollywood at the premiere of The Parisian Woman, the actress said she's waiting for her anger to subside before lending her voice or sharing her own stories.

""I don't have a tidy soundbite for you, because I am not a child and I have learned that when I have spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself,"" she said. ""So I've been waiting to feel less angry, and when I'm ready, I'll say what I have to say.""

Weinstein is being investigated by police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, New York and London for alleged acts of sexual assault.

A boat carrying eight men claiming to be North Korean fishermen has washed ashore the coast in Japan.

Japanese police said the men were found at Yurihonjo city's marina late on Thursday, and taken into custody.

The men had told authorities that their boat experienced difficulties and they ended up drifting into Japanese waters.

Japan regularly sees North Korean fishing boats straying into its territory, and its coastguard has occasionally had to rescue fishermen.

But sometimes the boats - often simple or rickety vessels - are found with bodies onboard, indicating that the vessels had been drifting for some time.

The 'North Korea ghost boats' washing up on Japan

In the latest incident, Japanese authorities said the men were able to walk unaided. A Korean interpreter has been brought in to help with obtaining details of their story, reported broadcaster NHK.

The Japanese government says it believes they are fishermen and not spies or asylum seekers.

Hachiro Okonogo, chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, told reporters that the men said they drifted over to Yurihonjo, in the north east of Japan, ""after their ship experienced troubles"".

Japanese media said the men were apparently fishing for squid. Photos of their boat showed the vessel kitted out with bare light bulb, which are often used by fishermen to attract fish at night.

According to some Japanese media outlets, the men have said they intend to return to North Korea.

Defections by boat to Japan are not common given the distance, though it has happened before - in 2011, nine North Koreans tried to sail to South Korea but ended up across the sea in Japan.

Over the summer North Korea fired two missiles over Japan, angering Tokyo. This month also saw the high profile defection of a North Korean soldier to South Korea across the Demilitarised Zone.","national public safety commission

Al Franken issued another apology on Thanksgiving to women who have accused him of groping them, but indicated he intends to stay in the Senate, and said he would start working to rebuild the trust of voters in Minnesota.

""I feel terribly that I've made some women feel badly and for that I am so sorry, and I want to make sure that never happens again,"" he said in a statement.

""And let me say again to Minnesotans that I'm sorry for putting them through this and I'm committed to regaining their trust,"" he added.

Franken is under some pressure to resign his seat after four women came forward to accuse the Democratic senator of forcibly kissing them or touching their buttocks without their consent. Franken seemed to chalk that up to him just being friendly with people.

“I’ve met tens of thousands of people and taken thousands of photographs, often in crowded and chaotic situations. I’m a warm person; I hug people,” Franken said.

But Franken acknowledged that he “crossed a line” in some situations and says he’s learned from the stories of the women accusing him of inappropriately touching them.

“Some women have found my greetings or embraces for a hug or photo inappropriate, and I respect their feelings about that,” Franken’s Thanksgiving statement said. “I’ve thought a lot in recent days about how that could happen, and recognize that I need to be much more careful and sensitive in these situations.”

Franken, who has called for an investigation of himself from the Senate Ethics Committee, vowed to change his actions and regain the trust of Minnesotans.

But the senator did not clarify in the statement how he would do so, and a poll released Thursday showed only 22 percent of Minnesotans want Franken to stay in the Senate after the misconduct allegations surfaced.

Radio host Leeann Tweeden last week accused Franken of forcibly kissing her during a USO tour in 2006. Tweeden also released a photo of Franken appearing to touch her breasts while she was sleeping.

Days later, Lindsay Menz came forward and said Franken groped her while posing for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010, two years after he was elected to the Senate.

Two other women told the Huffington Post they attended events during Franken’s first Senate campaign where he touched their buttocks without permission.","senate ethics committee

AP,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  Philip Rivers was more than comfortable on the Thanksgiving stage for the first time in his 14 NFL seasons.",2017-11-24T00:32:12+00:00,google-news,"Rivers, Chargers beat fading Cowboys 28-6 on Thanksgiving (Nov 23, 2017)",https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/rivers-chargers-beat-fading-cowboys-28-6-on-thanksgiving-112317,https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/11/201711231810654081327-p2.vresize.1200.630.high.0.jpeg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) Philip Rivers was more than comfortable on the Thanksgiving stage for the first time in his 14 NFL seasons.

Same with Keenan Allen, who didn’t have to wait nearly that long.

Rivers threw for 434 yards and three touchdowns, Allen had a career-high 172 yards in his second straight huge game and the Los Angeles Chargers beat the fading Dallas Cowboys 28-6 on Thursday.

Article continues below ...

Desmond King returned an interception 90 yards for the punctuating touchdown. The Chargers (5-6) moved within 1 1/2 games of AFC West-leading Kansas City after starting 0-4 while the Chiefs won their first five.

”Playing on Thanksgiving was everything it was cranked up to be,” said Rivers, who was 27 of 33 in his ninth career 400-yard game . ”As a quarterback, you want to play well and throw it to your guys, and we did a lot today. But I’m more excited about our team.”

The defending NFC East champion Cowboys (5-6) have lost three straight games by at least 20 points for the first time since 2004, all without suspended star running back Ezekiel Elliott in a damaging slide for their fading playoff hopes.

Dallas, playing its 50th Thanksgiving game, finally ended a touchdown drought at a team-record 10 quarters on Rod Smith’s 2-yard run early in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys have been outscored 72-6 in the second half of the three losses.

Quarterback Dak Prescott has looked lost without Elliott, his backfield mate for a pair of remarkable rookie seasons that led the Cowboys to the best record in the NFC last season. Prescott had two interceptions, giving him five in two games after throwing just four a year ago.

Last year’s NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year has nine picks for the season and the Cowboys already have twice as many losses as a year ago with Elliott only halfway through a six-game suspension for alleged domestic violence.

”The last thing I’m doing is pointing a finger and saying, `We need this guy, we need that to happen,”’ said Prescott, who was 20 of 27 for 179 yards in his third straight game without a TD pass. ”I’m going to say we’ve just got to figure out what’s going on and get out of this slump.”

Rivers had seven completions of at least 22 yards, including Allen’s 42-yard catch-and-run when he weaved through five defenders for a 22-6 lead.

Allen, in his fifth season, has two of his three biggest yardage games in the past two weeks. He had 11 catches and a score after 12 grabs for 159 yards and two TDs in a 54-24 win over Buffalo.

”When I first got here, he was a little heavy,” first-year coach Anthony Lynn said. ”I think once he got his weight down, you could see the run after catch, the quickness, all those things you see in a No. 1 receiver.”

LA, with 500-plus total yards (515) for the first time in two years, overcame the loss of kicker Nick Novak to a back injury, the second straight game that Dallas’ opposing kicker was injured and in the same game that Dallas’ Dan Bailey returned after missing four games with a groin injury.

Just like last week in the Cowboys’ blowout loss to division-leading Philadelphia, neither of the kickers mattered much with the Dallas offense sputtering and the defense not getting key stops.

Novak returned to make a 22-yard field goal after the injury, but left for good after missing an extra point . Punter Drew Kaser was 1 of 3 on extra points. The Chargers went for a fourth-and-13 in field goal range in a scoreless game early in the second quarter with Novak’s status in doubt, coming up a yard short.

Four-time Pro Bowl left tackle Tyron Smith returned for Dallas after missing two games with back and groin injuries, but the Cowboys lost 2014 All-Pro right guard Zack Martin to a concussion in the first half.

Austin Ekeler had a 38-yard catch to set up San Diego’s first touchdown in the third quarter, and Tyrell Williams added a 31-yard grab before making a 27-yard scoring catch.

THANKSGIVING STREAK

LA has a Thanksgiving winning streak in Texas, because the Chargers’ previous holiday showing was a 21-17 AFL win at Houston in 1969, the year before the merger. It was the longest gap (48 years) for a team between Thanksgiving games in NFL history.

WITTEN RECORD

Dallas tight end Jason Witten, already the Thanksgiving record-holder in catches, passed Detroit’s Herman Moore for the most yards on the holiday. Witten now has 80 catches for 853 yards.

ANTHEM UPDATE

Chargers LT Russell Okung was the only player from either team with a display during the national anthem, raising his fist while he was a step behind teammates lined up on the sideline.

UP NEXT

Chargers: Browns on Dec. 3 in first of two straight home games.

Cowboys: Redskins next Thursday in last of three straight home games.

Sara Reardon,Researchers funded by the US military are developing appliances to record neural activity and automatically stimulate the brain to treat mental illness.,2017-11-22T05:00:00Z,hacker-news,AI-controlled brain implants for mood disorders tested in people,http://www.nature.com/news/ai-controlled-brain-implants-for-mood-disorders-tested-in-people-1.23031,http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/7.47752.1511371258!/image/GettyImages-151033205web.jpg_gen/derivatives/nature_homepage/GettyImages-151033205web.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"BSIP/UIG/Getty

Brain implants that deliver electrical pulses tuned to a person’s feelings and behaviour are being tested in people for the first time. Two teams funded by the US military’s research arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), have begun preliminary trials of ‘closed-loop’ brain implants that use algorithms to detect patterns associated with mood disorders. These devices can shock the brain back to a healthy state without input from a physician.

The work, presented last week at the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) meeting in Washington DC, could eventually provide a way to treat severe mental illnesses that resist current therapies. It also raises thorny ethical concerns, not least because the technique could give researchers a degree of access to a person’s inner feelings in real time.

The general approach — using a brain implant to deliver electric pulses that alter neural activity — is known as deep-brain stimulation. It is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, but has been less successful when tested against mood disorders. Early evidence suggested that constant stimulation of certain brain regions could ease chronic depression, but a major study involving 90 people with depression found no improvement after a year of treatment.1

The scientists behind the DARPA-funded projects say that their work might succeed where earlier attempts failed, because they have designed their brain implants specifically to treat mental illness — and to switch on only when needed. “We’ve learned a lot about the limitations of our current technology,” says Edward Chang, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who is leading one of the projects.

DARPA is supporting Chang’s group and another at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, with the eventual goal of treating soldiers and veterans who have depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Each team hopes to create a system of implanted electrodes to track activity across the brain as they stimulate the organ.

The groups are developing their technologies in experiments with people with epilepsy who already have electrodes implanted in their brains to track their seizures. The researchers can use these electrodes to record what happens as they stimulate the brain intermittently ― rather than constantly, as with older implants.

Mood map

At the SfN meeting, electrical engineer Omid Sani of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles — who is working with Chang’s team — showed the first map of how mood is encoded in the brain over time. He and his colleagues worked with six people with epilepsy who had implanted electrodes, tracking their brain activity and moods in detail over the course of one to three weeks. By comparing the two types of information, the researchers could create an algorithm to ‘decode’ that person’s changing moods from their brain activity. Some broad patterns emerged, particularly in brain areas that have previously been associated with mood.

Chang and his team are ready to test their new single closed-loop system in a person as soon as they find an appropriate volunteer, Sani says. Chang adds that the group has already tested some closed-loop stimulation in people, but he declined to provide details because the work is preliminary.

The MGH team is taking a different approach. Rather than detecting a particular mood or mental illness, they want to map the brain activity associated with behaviours that are present in multiple disorders — such as difficulties with concentration and empathy. At the SfN meeting, they reported on tests of algorithms they developed to stimulate the brain when a person is distracted from a set task, such as matching images of numbers or identifying emotions on faces.

The researchers found that delivering electrical pulses to areas of the brain involved in decision-making and emotion significantly improved the performance of test participants. The team also mapped the brain activity that occurred when a person began failing or slowing at a set task because they were forgetful or distracted, and found they were able to reverse it with stimulation. They are now beginning to test algorithms that use specific patterns of brain activity as a trigger to automatically stimulate the brain.

Personalized treatment

Wayne Goodman, a psychiatrist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, hopes that closed-loop stimulation will prove a better long-term treatment for mood disorders than previous attempts at deep-brain stimulation — partly because the latest generation of algorithms is more personalized and based on physiological signals, rather than a doctor's judgement. “You have to do a lot of tuning to get it right,” says Goodman, who is about to launch a small trial of closed-loop stimulation to treat obsessive–compulsive disorder.

One challenge with stimulating areas of the brain associated with mood, he says, is the possibility of overcorrecting emotions to create extreme happiness that overwhelms all other feelings. Other ethical considerations arise from the fact that the algorithms used in closed-loop stimulation can tell the researchers about the person’s mood, beyond what may be visible from behaviour or facial expressions. While researchers won't be able to read people's minds, “we will have access to activity that encodes their feelings,” says Alik Widge, a neuroengineer and psychiatrist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and engineering director of the MGH team. Like Chang and Goodman’s teams, Widge’s group is working with neuroethicists to address the complex ethical concerns surrounding its work.

Still, Chang says, the stimulation technologies that his team and others are developing are only a first step towards better treatment for mood disorders. He predicts that data from trials of brain implants could help researchers to develop non-invasive therapies for mental illnesses that stimulate the brain through the skull. “The exciting thing about these technologies,” he says, “is that for the first time we’re going to have a window on the brain where we know what’s happening in the brain when someone relapses.”","university of california san francisco ucsf

“I'm hitting ‘Do Not Call,’ ‘Do Not Call,’ ‘Do Not Call,’ ‘Do Not Call,’ and they still call every single day,” said Waggoner, who PC World once dubbed the “Viceroy of Viagra,” and who insisted on a striking number of occasions during our conversation that he sends emails only to people who voluntarily enter their email addresses into, in his words, “thousands of web sites all over the internet.”

“It's like dude, come on,” Waggoner said of the robocalls. “It's ridiculous.""

Macallan Rare Cask

For a while, spam — unsolicited bulk messages sent for commercial or fraudulent purposes — seemed to be fading away. The 2003 CAN-SPAM Act mandated unsubscribe links in email marketing campaigns and criminalized attempts to hide the sender’s identity, while sophisticated filters on what were then cutting-edge email providers like Gmail buried unwanted messages in out-of-sight spam folders. In 2004, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told a crowd at the World Economic Forum that “two years from now, spam will be solved.” In 2011, cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs noted that increasingly tech savvy law enforcement efforts were shutting down major spam operators — including SpamIt.com, alleged to be a major hub in a Russian digital criminal organization that was responsible for an estimated fifth of the world’s spam. These efforts meant that the proportion of all emails that are spam has slowly fallen to a low of about 50 percent in recent years, according to Symantec research.

“I am harassed by a faceless entity that I cannot track down.” — Troy Doliner, a student in Boston who gets robocalls every day

But it’s 2017, and spam has clawed itself back from the grave. It shows up on social media and dating sites as bots hoping to lure you into downloading malware or clicking an affiliate link. It creeps onto your phone as text messages and robocalls that ring you five times a day about luxury cruises and fictitious tax bills. Networks associated with the buzzy new cryptocurrency system Ethereum have been plagued with spam. Facebook recently fought a six-month battle against a spam operation that was administering fake accounts in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Last year, a Chicago resident sued the Trump campaign for allegedly sending unsolicited text message spam; this past November, ZDNet reported that voters were being inundated with political text messages they never signed up for. Apps can be horrid spam vectors, too — TechCrunch writer Jordan Crook wrote in April about how she idly downloaded an app called Gather that promptly spammed everyone in her contact list. Repeated mass data breaches that include contact information, such as the Yahoo breach in which 3 billion user accounts were exposed, surely haven’t helped. Meanwhile, you, me, and everyone we know is being plagued by robocalls. “There is no recourse for me,” lamented Troy Doliner, a student in Boston who gets robocalls every day. “I am harassed by a faceless entity that I cannot track down.”

“I think we had a really unique set of circumstances that created this temporary window where spam was in remission,” said Finn Brunton, an assistant professor at NYU who wrote Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet, “and now we’re on the other side of that, with no end in sight.”

The first generation of spam was mostly advertising, but this new incarnation is largely driven by the higher payoffs in crime, according to 10 experts in telephony and digital security who spoke to The Outline. “Even if everyone in the entire population of the world were going bald and had erectile dysfunction simultaneously, there’s still more money in account takeover and identity theft,” said Adam Levin, the founder of security firm CyberScout and the author of Swiped, a 2015 book about identity theft.

We talked to an infamous spammer on our daily podcast, The Outline World Dispatch. Subscribe on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen.

Robocalls are perhaps the most ubiquitous symptom of the new spam paradigm. In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission received 3.5 million complaints about unwanted telemarketing calls; Last year, it racked up 5.3 million. YouMail, a robocall blocker, estimated there were 29 billion robocalls placed to Americans in 2016. Robocalls can come from political groups, who are exempt from the Do Not Call registry in the United States, from sellers of dubious goods like home security systems that ignore the Do Not Call registry, or from scammers who claim to represent resort sweepstakes, credit card financing, and tech support groups in a bid to steal credit card information.

The first generation of spam was mostly advertising, but this new incarnation is largely driven by the higher payoffs in crime.

The mechanisms by which those calls reach your phone can be circuitous. Will Maxson, an assistant director of the FTC’s Division of Marketing Practices, described a complex system in which telemarketers, sometimes based in the United States, contract with robocall farms that are often based overseas and can be large operations or a single person with a computer. Those robocallers use auto dialers and internet telephony software to place large numbers of calls, often spoofing the number of origin to appear as though it were coming from a local area code. If a lead seems promising, sometimes the robocall farms will even transfer the call to a specialist back in the United States to seal the deal.

“You have a wide variety of clients for this,” Maxson said. “Some will be for outright frauds that are pitching you for something that doesn’t exist, but they could also be making calls on behalf of real products.”

The FTC has shut down a number of robocall scams. This summer it imposed steep fines on a group that offered bogus credit card refinancing, and earlier this year it forced two large operations to pay substantial fines and agree to stop robocalling. And in a raid last year, Indian authorities shut down a Mumbai scam operation that was reportedly netting nearly $150,000 per day by pretending to be the Internal Revenue Service.

Representatives from those busted organizations failed to reply to messages seeking comment. But an individual who posted on a blackhat hacker forum that he could sell a database of tens of millions of US phone numbers, complete with associated email and postal addresses, told me that though he himself is annoyed by robocalls, he does what he needs to in order to earn a living. He obtains phone numbers from data sellers and lead generation sites that offer users free stuff in exchange for giving up their contact information, he said, and insisted that though he’s been slapped with fines in the past, he now complies with laws governing the sale of phone numbers.

“I mean I see it as a tool to help marketers find the right person,” said that man, who identified himself as Brian Masin during a Skype chat interview.

Masin, who said he’s based in the DC metro area and made as much as $160,000 per year in the internet marketing business, though not all from selling phone numbers, also mused that “if you buy homesec[u]rity online then you deserve” to get “duped.”

In addition to the FTC, a number of app developers and people like telecom consultant Roger Anderson, who created a posse of phone bots designed to waste robocallers’ time by pretending to be human, have all taken up the fight — but today, the calls still persist.

The second coming of spam isn’t just robocalls, of course. It’s rampant on Twitter, for example, where vast botnets boost follower counts for money and push political propaganda. It crops up on Tinder and OkCupid, where bots with voluptuous profile pictures stumble through flirty banter — “I am totally a sex addict"" — and inevitably send links to websites that demand credit card numbers. Ashley Madison, a hookup site for extramarital affairs that gained notoriety when its user data was stolen in 2015, harbored millions of “sexbot” accounts intended to sucker users into paying for premium membership.

The volume of spam email has leveled off overall, and Google says it can detect 99.9 percent of spam and phishing attempts in Gmail. But what email spam is left has become more sophisticated and criminal. According to a Symantec report, spam emails are more likely than ever to contain ransomware, which locks up a target’s computer until they pay up, usually in a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Customized, legitimate-looking emails crafted specially to pilfer the financial information of specific individuals or companies, commonly known as “spear phishing,” are also on the rise. “As people share every morsel of their lives online, it makes more information available to people who exploit it,” Levin said. “They prey on the fact that we all have day jobs. We’re busy, and we’re distracted.”

The future of spam is uncertain. Platforms are constantly working to beat it back, but experts we spoke to agreed that for the time being, anti-spam efforts are likely to remain a cat-and-mouse game as disingenuous marketers find new mediums to exploit — especially in the face of rampant data collection and sharing by entities as small as a single hacker scraping email addresses and as large as Facebook and Google.

“The bulk of our lives online could be spammy.” — Finn Brunton, author of “Spam: A Shadow History of the Internet,” on the future of spam

In the long term, Brunton, the NYU professor, imagines two potential futures for spam. In the first, advanced machine learning would become so adept at filtering out messages that aren’t worth our attention that the economic models of spam would collapse entirely. And the opposite of that spamless utopia would be a future in which a public that doesn’t see its attention as valuable could allow spam to gradually become normalized and omnipresent — an internet of bleating, personalized come-ons like the holograms in Minority Report.

“The bulk of our lives online could be spammy,” Brunton said. “Our whole experience could be monetized. We could just get used — forgive my language — to really shitty content all the time.”

It’s enough to make you long for a time when spam was simpler. Waggoner, the spam king, has never shied away from his critics — once he showed up to an FTC forum on spam dressed in black, like a character in The Matrix, with small dark glasses that he took off dramatically as he answered questions and occasionally sparred with a heckling audience.

Waggoner sees today’s robocallers and social media spammers as unprincipled; he insists, for example, that he’s never sold data to other marketers.

“Lazy,” he said. “No skill. It isn't like the good days, like when my career started off.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story referred to Jordan Crook by the wrong gender pronoun.

One of anime's most beloved creators takes us behind the scenes on his many iconic projects. One of anime's most beloved creators takes us behind the scenes on his many iconic projects.

Shinichiro Watanabe is an anime legend; a name mentioned in the same breath as esteemed creators like Hayao Miyazaki, Satoshi Kon and Katsuhiro Otomo. He’s best known for creating Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Space Dandy, a number of projects for Animatrix, and recently, an anime short set in the Blade Runner universe. Speaking to IGN at Melbourne’s Madman Anime Festival, the western-inspired creator shared stories behind the creation of some of his beloved works, his inspirations, and opinions on live-action adaptations.

A defining quality of Watanabe’s series’ is that they’re heavily inspired by western music. He first came up with the idea behind Cowboy Bebop, the action series about a spaceship crew of bounty hunters, after listening to 1940s blues and creating a story around a soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex). Characters like Faye and her struggle to find somewhere to belong, and Jet’s hard-boiled past as a detective, came to Watanabe after listening to My Funny Valentine and Led Zeppelin's Black Dog. The character design of Spike was based on Yusaku Matsuda, a famous Japanese movie star known for playing suave charismatic action heroes.

“ In Cowboy Bebop, 1940s jazz meets the classic western cowboy, sci-fi space combat and Hong Kong action film aesthetics.

Over the 26 episode long adventure, the Bebop’s crew - a space cowboy, an ex-detective, a woman with a mysterious past, a child genius and a genetically engineered corgi - went on a multi-genre voyage. Watanabe paid homage to a variety of pop culture icons over the run of the show, from Alien, Taxi Driver and Desperado through to the eclectic western cowboy trope and music from the Rolling Stones. Nearly 20 years since the series debuted, Cowboy Bebop is still beloved by fans across the world and recognised as one of the greatest anime TV series of all time. It’s an example of Watanabe’s directorial ability to blend very different genres into an incredible visceral and stylistic creation. In Cowboy Bebop, 1940s jazz meets the classic western cowboy, sci-fi space combat and Hong Kong action film aesthetics.

A series of stills displayed at the Cowboy Bebop Exhibition at Madman Anime Festival 2017.

“When creating Cowboy Bebop,” Watanabe tells me, “I thought it would be more interesting if I added different types of elements together to create something that was completely new.”

“With Samurai Champloo, we were thinking of listening to hip hop music, watching a lot of Japanese style traditional dramas - old style dramas - that was the sort of image I had when putting those ideas together,” he continues. “With Space Dandy, you’ve obviously got your image of the space and 80s music, and blending them together is how I created it.”

In an attempt to merge those two ideas together, Watanabe instructed the show’s composers to use musical instruments that predated the 1980s, grounding the musical tone in a camp 80s feel.

“I had a lot of people tell me Space Dandy was like Guardians of the Galaxy,” he adds. “However, they were actually created around the same time and after I got to watch Guardians of the Galaxy after Dandy was finished and completed, I realised, ‘oh yeah, they actually have a similar feeling, they’re actually quite similar.’”

Speaking to fans during a Director Insights and Cowboy Bebop: Behind the Series panel, Watanabe shared that originally, Cowboy Bebop was created in partnership with Namco Bandai to promote their toy and figurine line. The company planned to use the series to push a new range of spaceship figurines, so Watanabe was told to incorporate scenes with spaceship combat into the story. Namco Bandai didn’t have faith in the project, however, and disbanded that partnership after Sunrise finished producing the first four episodes. This, Watanabe explains, is why space combat is barely featured in later episodes.

IGN: Something I’ve always wanted to ask about after having watched the series is after Spike leaves the Bebop, what happens to Faye and Jet?

Shinichiro Watanabe: [Laughs] Okay. Challenging question. I’ve never really clearly stated what happens to Faye or Jet in any official situation. What happens to them after Spike leaves the ship? Don’t also forget that in the last scene of the series, Spike could be sleeping.

IGN: [Laughs] I didn’t think that. Do you think that Faye and Jet would continue on as partners or go their separate ways? Of course with Faye, a big part of her character arc is finding a place she belongs and feeling like the Bebop crew is her family.

Shinichiro Watanabe: I guess you could say I don’t think they’d get along very well.

IGN: Each of your series always follows a core cast of three, there’s always two men who clash and a woman who tags along. Is that a conscientious decision or something you gravitate towards when storyboarding?

Shinichiro Watanabe: It’s kind of subconscious but don’t forget in Cowboy Bebop, there’s four of them.

IGN: Yeah, there’s Ed as well. He - or Her - I’m still not quite sure...

Shinichiro Watanabe: Its gender is meaningless, we don’t need it.

IGN: Well actually, I’d like to quickly ask about that. Why did you decide for Ed to be non-binary and have no gender, or have their gender be ambiguous?

Shinichiro Watanabe: I wanted to create a character that surpasses humanity. I personally think that he might not even be human, someone from outer space.

IGN: What about Ein? Why did you decide for him to be a corgi?

Shinichiro Watanabe: I had a very strong request from the scenario writer that she really loved corgis and we had to have a corgi. She told me there’s no way of doing any other type of dogs, it had to be a corgi.

Watanabe’s work has strong western roots so it’s no surprise that he grew up influenced by western films. When developing the character of Spike, Watanabe based his fluid movement on Bruce Lee’s Jeet Kune Do martial art, and his suave demeanor on film noir protagonists and Clint Eastwood.

“The anime that inspired me the most and one that I probably have influence from is the very first series of Lupin the 3rd,” Watanabe says, drawing comparisons between Lupin and Spike. “I’m very drawn to Enter the Dragon and Dirty Harry, too. They definitely inspire me. And, of course, Blade Runner.”

“ ""The anime that inspired me the most and one that I probably have influence from is the very first series of Lupin the 3rd. I’m very drawn to Enter the Dragon and Dirty Harry, too... and, of course, Blade Runner."" - Shinichiro Watanabe.

“When it was released in the 80s in Japan, Blade Runner was actually a series that influenced the Japanese media very much so,” he explains. “I assume that everyone in the anime industry has seen Blade Runner at some point. Pretty much all of the special effects style sci-fi movies or series out there starting looking a lot like Blade Runner.”

Being a fan of the original dystopian sci-fi cult-classic, Watanabe was ecstatic to direct an anime prequel to the Blade Runner 2049 sequel called Blade Runner BlackOut 2022.

“The offer originally came from [the] America[n] [studio] themselves,” he recalls. “When I was first given the offer to do the prequel… I really like the character from the first Blade Runner movie, Roy Batty, so I really wanted to make a story for him. However, the owner of the whole entire franchise wanted to have something that connects the first and second films, and because Roy dies in the first movie, I wasn’t able to pass that through. It was a rejected idea.”

“Having discussions with the producer on Blade Runner 2049, they used a word called the BlackOut incident, which was not mentioned a lot. They decided it was probably a better idea if we related this new 2049 to that particular incident. That’s what happened.”

In the Blade Runner universe, the BlackOut incident was an event that occurred well before the events of Blade Runner 2049, in which an EMP explosion caused a global blackout with enormous destructive effects on the world. Watanabe’s anime short follows a ragtag group of replicants on a suicide mission to destroy an industrial facility which acts as a catalyst for the event.

“The Director [of Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve] told me, ‘definitely do this incident,’” he continues. “‘We’d love a short on it.’ We decided that we’d do this particular incident and from there, they pretty much gave the rest to us to decide on the finer details. We created the finer details on what we believed would work and received an okay from them to go ahead with the project. That’s how it occurred.”

Even then, when asked if this meant he had creative control on the project, Watanabe tilted his head and winced, “there were many troubles but [working with western studios] is usually a hard scene.”

“In a general sense, most of the time, the directors and creators are really great people,” he explains, “however, as we were going through the project, so-and-so here or so-and-so there or all the other people around added their own ideas. That is what usually causes the trouble, I believe… Even with the Animatrix project, technically speaking, there was more trouble that occurred there.”

In the last few years, the anime and western film industries have converged with Hollywood producing live-action adaptations of Ghost in the Shell, Death Note and soon, Makoto Shinkai’s Your Name. Despite admitting he hadn’t seen the former two western projects, with Hollywood adapting Cowboy Bebop into a live-action TV series, I was curious to know what Watanabe thought of this new relationship.

“In my personal opinion, if the live-action adaptation is able to bring out the good points of what was part of the anime or original manga series - if they’re able to keep that alive - then I think it’s a good point,” he frankly explains. “If they’re actually adapting it and spoiling what was particularly good about those series or the good thing about being in animation or manga, then I don’t think that’s really a great thing.”

IGN: I just want to quickly bounce back to the Cowboy Bebop live-action. Hollywood are now adapting it into a live-action TV series, how involved are you with that?

Shinichiro Watanabe: It’s not quite decided yet. We’re actually currently in discussions of whether I will be involved or not be involved. However, it is seen that the staff that are going to work with the project really respects the original animation. They’re going to try and bring as much of the animation as possible - you can’t really say anything until it’s actually done but that’s currently the discussion.

IGN: Has the studio decided on who will play Spike or if not, who is someone you think would do a good job?

Shinichiro Watanabe: It doesn’t seem like they’ve decided on anybody yet. It sounds like they’re still in the middle of casting the main roles. In fact, there’s been a number of times we’ve talked about adapting it into a live-action however it’s been stopped several times. The project’s just halted. I’m not quite sure how this one will go this time.

Watanabe has a very extensive and diverse portfolio, including directing a series of animated advertisements for Nike starring Lebron James, not to mention Terror in Resonance, an intense cyber-crime drama about a group of teen terrorists. The latter is darker than his other work despite following a younger cast; a decision he says was based on trying to aim towards a younger generation.

“If you’ve been working in this industry for quite some time, you find you start to mature,” he recalls. “You always want to make something that seems more stable but I wanted to remember back to my younger days. [When storyboarding Terror in Resonance,] I thought back to those days where I was sort of still maturing.”

“In Japan, there’s a period of your teens in your second of year of middle school - called chuuni - where you start imagining and drifting off in your mind,” he continues. “That concept was something I had to think back to for when I was in that age group in my teens. [Terror in Resonance] was what I would’ve been like in my chuuni days.”

“I wanted to make something that resonates with that, therefore there was a tendency to have a lot of younger staff. A lot of the cast are around 20 years old. I wanted to create something that from a ten to 19 years old perspective because they have their own unique perspective. That was definitely something I was trying to challenge for.”

Some of the awesome sketches that were on display at the Cowboy Bebop Exhibition at Madman Anime Festival 2017.

When asked about the rise of international streaming services becoming anime producers, like Netflix’s $8 billion plan to release 30 anime series in 2018, the esteemed director admitted to being hopeful that it would provide more opportunities for unique and challenging content.

“There is the view in Japan that in the past ten years, there’s a tendency for production companies to rely on sales of a Bluray product, and then move forward towards another series or new project,” he explains. “If moe cutesy style is going to sell, then it’s the only style of anime that will be approved for production. The ones that we would consider more challenging or fun to create would not be accepted.”

“However, if that is going to change, I don’t have a problem with it at all. Looking at the current market, we don’t know which way it’ll go, it’s hard to say. For example, if we’re going back to Terror in Resonance, there was actually a case where for about five years the project was pending and we couldn’t get approval. If this is going to change anything and if projects will be moved on faster then that’s a very good thing.”

Since directing Blade Runner BlackOut 2022, Shinichiro Watanabe has begun planning a new series with Studio Bones, the studio made up of ex-Cowboy Bebop Studio Sunrise staff members and behind some of the best action anime adaptations: My Hero Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Mob Psycho 100. Watanabe is currently travelling around the world for inspiration for the new project, admiring the architecture and live music scene of Melbourne, Australia, before in true Watanabe fashion, creating a series that promises to feature heavy musical roots. Other than that, we don’t know much yet, and Watanabe refused to give any details.

One interesting tidbit he did tell fans, however, was that he had once directed a series based on tango music but the project was halted before he could complete it. He admits that if you ever see an original anime series in the future with a strong tango-theme, it might be the one he was involved in.

Since Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe has had an incredible influence on anime and pop culture, much in the same way Hideaki Anno’s Neon Genesis Evangelion has. What started as a promotional program for a new line of Namco Bandai toys has become one of the most unique and mesmerising series to come out of Japan. There is no doubt that this Space Cowboy has left a mark on the animation industry, and whether that will translate to a western live-action TV series is for only time to tell.

Full Spoilers Following for Marvel’s The Punisher: “Cold Steel.”

Billy Russo is a bad man, but now there is some clarity as to how he got there. Creating an origin story for a villain is no easy task. Daredevil: Season 1 gave Kingpin a memorable tale in “Shadows in the Glass,” so it was great to see The Punisher deliver a solid backstory for Billy as well.

While Agent Orange continues his unremarkable streak of boring speeches, Billy is beginning to shine as the show’s primary villain. There’s a higher level of complexity to him now that was missing before. Knowing more about his origins is making him a better character.

Like Kingpin, Billy has been shaped by the events of his childhood. Throughout the first half of the season, I was looking for that singular moment when Billy turned bad, but that was the wrong way of thinking about it.

The writers instead delivered something more interesting. There is no singular moment, but a cascading effect of bad experiences that Billy had to endure as a child. Billy is now just being who he is, which makes him a fascinating character to watch. His complexity covers a wide range of emotions that Ben Barnes is portraying superbly.

He believes himself to be Frank’s friend, Madani’s lover, and a patriot to his country all at the same time. Billy also has a chip on his shoulder that drives his ambition. Abandoned by his mom as a kid, he never had that figurehead to guide him down the right path. Thankfully, young Zach Lieberman does have a guide, even if it’s not the one he was expecting.

Frank and David’s relationship is still the solid foundation that this series has been built upon. There’s been a lot of focus on the men coming home from war and the side effects that ensue, but not about what the pain of losing a parent can do for a teenager. The moments between Frank and Zach were effective in showcasing that kind of pain.

Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s performance as he helplessly watches Frank’s attempt to teach his son a valuable life lesson was incredible. Both men are struggling to cope with the consequences of their actions; however, Frank has been given a kind of gift in the way he’s able to interact with David’s family. The basic fatherly tasks of playing catch and fixing broken headlights are now Frank’s responsibility. He’s getting a second chance at being a father, even if it’s only temporary.

Marvel’s The Punisher could have taken a wrong turn concerning Sarah and Frank’s relationship. Sure, they kissed, but it stopped there. The danger here would have been Frank and David entering into some kind of love-triangle, which would have hurt the show’s pacing. Fortunately, Frank’s strong words to David about not being interested in Sarah seem to have calmed David’s fears. Some fraternal bickering every now and then is fine, but the writers shouldn’t put a wrench in what is one of the best aspects of the show.

Before moving on, Agent Stein deserves a post-mortem. Michael Nathanson’s character never got the kind of development to make his death worth remembering. While his passing may spur Madani into a fit of rage, he was never more than the comic relief. It’s a shame too since Nathanson is capable of doing so much more. Check him in Steven Soderbergh’s The Knick for a better example of his abilities.

After eight episodes, The Punisher doesn’t feel like it’s losing any of its steam. Billy’s transformation from a trusted ally, to the series primary villain, has been well-crafted by the writers. Billy was brought up in a world that didn’t want him and it’s driving his desire for greatness at any cost. He’s an unfortunate example of a self-made man gone astray. Unlike Zach, Billy didn’t have someone to show him that he mattered. Maybe if he did, things would have been different.

Fans have rallied against EA for the use of microtransactions and recent changes to FIFA's mechanics.

A Reddit post and consumer campaign known as #FixFifa have been gaining traction around the internet. The movement also has a Change.org petition which has gained nearly 25,000 signatures at the time of writing.

The goal of the campaign is to fix a variety of issues that concerned players are reporting, including extending FIFA 18's Weekend League period and addressing the game's microtransactions.

Exit Theatre Mode

This isn't the first FIFA to use in-game currency for the popular Ultimate Team system, or to have microtransactions, but players are finding the drop rates unreliable and believe that spending real money is more of a necessity to be competitive.

Reddit user PuRe_SSROCK explains ""The packs are completely RNG and have terrible drop rates, you can either spend $1.50 and get the best player in the game, or spend thousands of dollars and get NOTHING. People with the best team in the game have spent a whopping $8,000+ to acquire it, which is absurd especially for a yearly game.""

EA is also dealing with massive fan backlash on its recent Star Wars Battlefront game which has had microtransactions pulled after Disney reportedly expressed concerns over its brand. It also recently pushed through some changes to Need for Speed Payback following negative community feedback regarding its in-game economy and upgrade system, which also features microtransactions.

Full Spoilers Following for Marvel’s The Punisher: “Crosshairs.” Make sure to keep up with all of our Marvel's The Punisher binge here.

An episode where Frank Castle doesn’t kill anyone is a rarity, but he managed to complete most of his mission without a single fatality. There’s a message in “Crosshairs” that deals with a bigger issue. The issue of senseless killing.

Some may say that Marvel’s The Punisher is the wrong show at the wrong time. Frank finds it easier to kill when he’s on a mission, but he doesn’t ignore that what he’s doing can have grave consequences.

When Chef David Lieberman is preparing Frank a lovely meal, Frank’s concern over killing US soldiers just doing their jobs made the assault on the military compound more effective. The writers aren’t making a show that glorifies mass murder. There are repercussions to what Frank does and it shows when he has to shoot the young soldier in the tunnel. Frank is angry at the system letting the country down, not the soldiers serving in it.

The Punisher is more of a commentary on post-traumatic stress disorder than it is a superhero show. Can’t it be both? Well, maybe, but the stories surrounding Frank and the other former soldier's reentry into society has been fascinating. Who would have thought a Marvel Netflix series would delve so deeply into such a controversial topic. It’s a difficult matter to discuss, but the writers are doing an admirable job tackling these issues.

Another example of this is Lewis Walcott and his relationship with his father. While there are moments when his story feels detached from Frank’s, it’s still an engaging arc on its own. Lewis and his dad could have their own series. His story is that strong.

The conversation between Lewis and his dad was heartbreaking to watch. Using the Muhammad Ali fight as an allegory for how to live life was a compelling moment. Lewis’ dad was trying to use the legendary fighter’s story as an example of what his son should do, yet Lewis appears to be too far gone to make any sense of it. Taking back control of his life has a whole other meaning for Lewis.

Unlike Billy Russo or Agent Orange, Lewis isn’t being driven by greed or a lust for power. Again, the real issues of what it means to come home after a war aren’t the easiest to watch, but it’s an important story to tell, even in a fictionalized reality where the Iron Fist and Luke Cage exist. What is Lewis going to do with that pressure-cooker bomb?

Thank goodness Madani and Stein found that bug. They’re still the least interesting part of the show, but perhaps without Agent Orange listening in, they can actually do something useful? Stein brought up a great point about Madani that could make for an interesting story in a future episode.

When Stein said Madani reminded him of Castle, I couldn’t help but think about how good the ending of episode 4 (“Resupply”) was. It was one of the few times Madani was a part of the action. Even though Frank only spoke to her once, it was an exciting moment. Madani could be a great character if only she was given an opportunity to do so. When she’s around Frank, she great. Stein’s observation could be an indication of a possible team-up down the road.

Frank’s motivation for taking down his enemies continues to work in the show’s favor, but the villains still feel like cookie-cutter tropes pulled out of a bad 80’s action movie. Agent Orange hasn’t been developed well. Paul Schulze is a wonderful actor, but that cold stare can only get him so far.

Billy Russo has promise, but there’s still a lot to uncover about why he decided to work for the bad guys. Betraying your friends for a cabin in the woods doesn’t seem like a guy who speaks so highly of Frank. Also, did Billy miss Frank on purpose, or is he just that bad of a shot? Ben Barnes oozes charisma when he’s on-screen, so if he does indeed transform into Jigsaw down the road, it’s nice to know The Punisher’s archenemy is in good hands.","billy miss frank

We'll get right to it: The Sonos One smart speaker is on sale for $175. Happy Black Friday, y'all.

With Alexa's help, you can play songs from your favorite music streaming service, check traffic and weather, and even connect with other Sonos sound devices to play music anywhere in your house. As of December 21, Sonos One will even work with Spotify voice commands and starting next year, it will support Google Assistant.

Mashable's own Brett Williams got to try out the Sonos One and had this to say:

The Sonos One works just fine as a smart hub, from what I saw and heard — you use it just like Amazon's Echo line — but it really stands out with rich audio quality and the ability to connect with and control other Sonos speakers all around their house to create a premium smart audio platform.

Sonos One is normally $199, but you can save $24 on it with this special Black Friday deal. Happy holiday hunting!","brett williams

Beginning Nov. 24 at Universal Studios Hollywood (the festivities kicked off at the Orlando theme parks on Nov. 18) and continuing through Jan. 8, you can get a taste of a snowy British Christmas without the chilly weather.

Hogsmeade has been transformed into a winter wonderland — complete with festively decorated storefront displays, holiday merch and, of course, the much-anticipated return of hot Butterbeer (which, if you're anything like this writer, will send you on a sugar high that would make a Hippogriff jealous).

Press got an early sneak peek at the Wizarding World's makeover last week, complete with a preview of the whimsical light projection that will be superimposed on Hogwarts Castle multiple times a night, pairing the iconic music from the Harry Potter films with images of caroling ghosts, broomstick-riding students, glittering trees and maybe even a firework or two.

Christmas at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter debuts at Universal Studios Hollywood on Nov. 24 - here’s a sneak peek of the magic. A post shared by Laura Prudom (@lauinla) on Nov 23, 2017 at 3:43pm PST

Visitors will also be treated (if that's the right word, depending on your tolerance for singing amphibians) to a performance from Hogwarts' a capella Frog Choir — first seen in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban — as they perform a variety of Harry Potter-themed Christmas carols. (Pity the human members of the choir festively decked out in their winter robes and scarves, since the weather in LA is expected to hit the mid 80s over Thanksgiving weekend.)

In addition to the Butterbeer in its hot, cold and frozen iterations, the parks are also serving up a hearty holiday dinner including roast turkey with gravy and cranberry sauce, pigs in blankets, braised red cabbage, and roasted potatoes, along with the festive British staple of Christmas Pudding for dessert.

And if you're wondering what to get the Potterhead in your life this Christmas, Universal has rolled out an eye-popping array of holiday-themed gifts to spend your galleons on, from ornaments and stockings to snow globes and winter wear.

That includes special baubles to represent each of Hogwarts' four houses, and plenty of Hogwarts Express-themed keepsakes, including replica trains and tickets. Universal has also introduced four new interactive wands for the season, based on the characters of Cho Chang, Cedric Diggory and Yaxley, as well as a Death Eater wand. The holidays also ring in a selection of new robes, including a replica of Professor Snape's ensemble, and a Gryffindor Quidditch outfit. Madam Malkin would approve.

Wandering through all the recognizable shops from the films and books is always a joy, but it's particularly charming when the storefronts are decked out with holiday wreaths, their snow-capped rooftops twinkling as day turns to night.

(Not that buying a new TV or iPhone isn't pretty life changing, obviously.)

Funny or Die and The Collective PAC have launched a new fundraising campaign to ""Reclaim Black Friday,"" hoping to use the day to support black politicians.

Stars including Yvette Nicole Brown, Meagan Good, Dulé Hill and Metta World Peace are on hand for the PSA, with Good pointing out that, despite the day being synonymous with retail, ""the main two words contain our pigmentation and the classic Ice Cube buddy film"" — so it's about time the holiday was reclaimed from the shopaholics.

Good also notes that ""90 percent of the elected officials in this country are white — not even 90 percent of the country is white."" Political strategist Carri Twigg notes that such underrepresentation ""means there's a lot of people making a lot of decisions that don't really understand the needs of the black community.""

""Instead of waking up early to get that out of date flatscreen,"" Brown says, ""Your money could help recruit, train and fund qualified black candidates.""

That sounds a lot more meaningful than wrestling a stranger to the ground for a discount Xbox, right?","the

American Family Insurance,It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,2017-11-23T20:13:03Z,mashable,Service members found a new way to benefit their communities back home,http://mashable.com/2017/11/23/service-members-help-from-middle-east/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/c126vPYM7HRWTgjB0v1dK11Pmso=/1200x630/2017%2F11%2F23%2F5f%2F5ae2c48a6085454ab7d1c9e73ade492a.acb5a.jpg,entertainment,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"For the spouses of the brave men and women serving overseas, a phone call or video chat is the only way for families to connect and express their support. Two women with husbands serving in the Middle East have thought of a new way to bring their families together by competing in a race with their husbands while they’re away.

American Family Insurance is a new platinum sponsor of the Berbee Derby 5K /10K Thanksgiving Day Run— a race benefiting Technology Education Foundation, which provides grants to nonprofits for technology programs that benefit underserved youth and adults.

Melanie Kleinheinz and Ashley Bergeman run 5K races every year with their husbands and wanted their family to be together. This year, they ignored the thousands of miles between them and found a way to run the Berbee Derby together.

“Our husbands are deployed together,” says Ashley, “And since we’ve always run the race in the past, we thought it would be fun to have our entire family run it this year.” The pair initially thought they’d run the race with the names of their husbands written on their shirts, but it was Melanie who decided to go the extra step.

“We contacted the Berbee Derby and they produced special shirts with our team name on the back to send over to the soldiers,” says Melanie. Along with the shirts, their husbands got a goody bag filled with custom race belts and bibs — the whole package from the Berbee Derby.

Image: AMERICAN FAMILY INSURANCE

After Melanie and Ashley’s husbands received their Berbee Derby swag, other soldiers in their unit became interested and signed up. The two women then took it upon themselves to contact the families of other soldiers and grow the team abroad as well as back home.

“We changed our team name to #DeploymentStrong and now many more soldiers and families will get to be a part of this,” says Ashley. “My husband loves to serve his country and I support him 100 percent. Serving in the military is a sacrifice that my husband, children, and I will continue to do proudly.”

""My husband loves to serve his country and I support him 100 percent. Serving in the military is a sacrifice that my husband, children, and I will continue to do proudly.""

As of now, the number of soldiers involved has grown to more than 30, with more than 80 spouses, family members, and friends running back home.

“There are so many families out there with loved ones deployed,” says Melanie, “and we hope this will bring awareness to what a military family looks like.”

“I think this is more than just a way to cope,” adds Ashley, “This is a way to mentor our children, bring awareness for the cause, and ultimately give back to the community. My goal is to share this story with others.

To show how a local community race can come together to support family members both near and far.”

This is the 14th annual Berbee Derby. American Family Insurance is a new platinum sponsor in 2017.

Since its inception, the Technology Education Foundation has raised over $1,500,000. The race typically draws between 6,000 and 6,500 runners and as many as 140 teams with the goal of the race to close the technology gap — specifically in the STEM areas.","melanie kleinheinz

The new collection has a real variety of stuff. Everything from sweatshirts wishing you a ""thicc holiday"" to comfy, colorful ""yoncé"" onesies.

A few of the new items are delightfully literal.

And there's even some preeeeeetty great wrapping paper that, of course, says, ""Best revenge is your paper.""

And, look, of course the new additions will be great to buy as gifts for all of your loved ones who appreciate Lemonade as much as you do.

But, also, let's be honest, no one probably does, so you should probably treat these as a personalized list to treat yo' self.

Ana Sandoiu,New research uncovers the mechanism by which brain cells die in neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia and Parkinson's disease.,2017-11-23T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Neurodegeneration: New cell death mechanism revealed,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320150.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320150/neuron.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"New research reveals how a dysfunction in the brain's so-called self-digestion system leads to cell death in neurodegenerative disorders. The newly discovered mechanism may lead to new therapies for conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.



When the brain's 'housekeeping' mechanism fails, neurons start degenerating. New research shows how. When the brain's 'housekeeping' mechanism fails, neurons start degenerating. New research shows how.

A healthy brain has a self-cleaning mechanism called ""autophagy,"" which in Greek etymology literally means ""eating oneself.""

In autophagy, brain cell parts that are no longer useful are broken down into even smaller parts, recycled, and are then used to create new cells. However, in neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, and many other incurable disorders, the autophagy process is faulty.

While this is something that researchers already knew, what they didn't know until now were the precise mechanisms by which this happens, and more specifically, how this leads to cell death — particularly in the late stages of the disease.

New research uncovers precisely these mechanisms. The groundbreaking study was carried out by scientists at King's College London in the United Kingdom, and the findings were published in the journal Current Biology.

While the study used a model of a single, rare neurodegenerative disorder known as dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), the findings are likely applicable to all neurological conditions that are characterized by faulty autophagy.

Dr. Olga Baron, of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College London, is the first author of the study, and Dr. Manolis Fanto, also from the IoPPN, is the senior and corresponding author.

Autophagy block mechanism revealed

Dr. Fanto and his team designed two DRPLA disease models using two different kinds of mice and replicated the findings in human cells.

The experiments revealed that a ""progressive stall"" and then a ""chronic block"" occur in autophagy, in certain disease-specific areas of the brain. In this ""persistent stall,"" the brain cells get ""confused"" and try to maintain a normal homeostasis through alternative molecular pathways, or routes.

But by doing so, the team reveals, the cells degrade themselves. In normal autophagy, cellular waste would be pushed out, keeping the brain ""clean"" — but because of the autophagy block, the cells start ""throwing out"" parts of themselves, leading to degradation.

Specifically, the study authors revealed the mechanisms by which the cells start degrading parts of their nucleus and cytoplasmic layer.

""[In this study,]"" they write, ""we report the first in vivo evidence of a nucleophagy-based mechanism in neurodegeneration, reflected in the association of nuclear Lamin B1 with GFP-LC3 in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.""

Current therapies may be misguided

""We hypothesize,"" they note, ""that this excretion process is a[n alternative] clearance mechanism for the cell. However, with the potential consequence of causing cell and tissue atrophy.""

Given that many therapies for neurodegenerative disorders attempt to boost cell clearance, the new findings suggest that such an approach might make matters worse rather than better.

In the absence of normal autophagy, this alternative cell clearance process ""depletes the cell of material, damaging its nucleus and cytoplasm and leaving behind cell corpses with a fragile nucleus and thin cytoplasmic layer.""

""The common factor underlying this mechanism of cell atrophy and death is a persistent block in autophagy,"" the authors conclude. ""Since chronic autophagy inhibition has been reported in an increasing number of rare and common human neurodegenerative pathologies, the mechanism here reported may, therefore, be of great relevance in human disease.""

The findings may be relevant in other neurodegenerative diseases where faulty autophagy is key.

""Autophagy is important for all degenerative neurological conditions and what is emerging from our study is how the blockage of autophagy kills nerve cells in a new way, not described before."" Dr. Manolis Fanto

Dr. Baron also comments on the findings, saying, ""Studies like ours, looking at rare genetic conditions, can be very powerful in finding new mechanisms.""

""We are currently looking into whether we can replicate the same findings for other disorders where autophagy has been shown to malfunction, like Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron disease,"" she adds.

If the findings are replicated, they could eventually lead to better, more precise therapies for improving symptoms of neurodegeneration.","institute of psychiatry psychology neuroscience ioppn at kings college london

Honor Whiteman,"If you're planning to enjoy your Thanksgiving meal in a restaurant this year, watch out; the delicious aromas may up your food intake.",2017-11-23T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Eating out may mean eating more this Thanksgiving,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320145.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320145/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"If you're shunning the stress of preparing a Thanksgiving dinner this year and eating out instead, you might want to approach the restaurant with caution; such an environment could cause you to eat more than you should.



If you're eating out for Thanksgiving, you could wind up eating more. If you're eating out for Thanksgiving, you could wind up eating more.

Research from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor suggests that food-related cues, such as images of food and inviting aromas, might trick us into thinking that we are hungry, even if we have just eaten.

But the researchers found that these cues are unlikely to make food taste better, nor do they increase the pleasure of eating them.

Study leader Michelle Joyner, who works in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan, and colleagues have published the findings in the journal Clinical Psychological Science.

Thanksgiving is a time for reflection, gratitude, and a delicious meal, all while surrounded by family and friends. However, while the latter might provoke thoughts of a home-cooked feast, some of us prefer to enjoy the food but without all the hard work.

According to a recent survey from the National Restaurant Association, around 1 in 10 people in the United States will eat their Thanksgiving meal at a restaurant this year.

But the new study suggests that restaurant-goers should watch out, because the sight of food and its delicious aroma may trigger hunger pangs, even after a full-blown turkey dinner.

Food cues lead to greater calorie intake

Joyner and her colleagues came to their findings by conducting a laboratory-based experiment in which they assessed how food-related cues impact feelings of hunger, food cravings, and food consumption.

The study included 112 college students, who were all randomly allocated to one of two groups.

One group was sent to a ""fast-food laboratory,"" where the laboratory was styled similar to a fast-food restaurant, with tables and chairs, or booths, images of food, and background music. The other group was sent to a ""neutral"" laboratory, with no food-related cues.

Both the groups were asked to eat lunch 1 hour before arriving at their designated laboratory. On arrival, they were given tokens that allowed them to purchase fast food such as cheeseburgers, French fries, and milkshakes. The tokens also allowed them to purchase time for activities unrelated to food, such as playing video games.

The team found that subjects who were exposed to food-related cues in the fast-food laboratory displayed more food cravings than those in the neutral laboratory, and they consumed 220 more calories.

Interestingly, there was no difference in how much the two groups liked the taste of the food that they consumed, or how much they enjoyed it.

""Food-related cues can make people want or crave food more, but don't have as much of an impact on their liking, or the pleasure they get from eating the food,"" says Joyner.

Findings 'have public health implications'

What is more, food-related cues were found to have no impact on participants' purchasing of non-food-related activities, which indicates that the behavioral effects of food cues are food-specific.

Taken together, the researchers say that their findings suggest that food cues may ""contribute to overconsumption through increased wanting and hunger. These findings have public health implications for overeating and obesity.""

So, you might want to stop and think before you go reaching for that extra slice of pumpkin pie: are you really still hungry? Or is the aroma of delicious food playing tricks on you?","national restaurant association around

This article examines the symptoms, causes, and treatment options.",2017-11-23T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,"Poliosis: Causes, symptoms, and treatment",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320129.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320129/poliosis-causing-a-circle-of-white-hair-image-credit-klaus-d-peter-gummersbach-germany-2011-november-5.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Poliosis is a condition that causes a white patch or patches to appear in a person's hair.

Glancing into the bathroom mirror and noticing streaks of white hair that were not there before can be a worrying experience. As with many other things in life, poliosis is less scary when it is understood.

Here is a look at just what poliosis is, what it means for the person with it, and how they can deal with it.

What is poliosis?



Poliosis causes white patches of hair.

Image credit: Klaus D. Peter, Gummersbach, Germany, (2011, November 5) Poliosis causes white patches of hair.Image credit: Klaus D. Peter, Gummersbach, Germany, (2011, November 5)

The white hair caused by poliosis is due to a lack of a pigment called melanin in the hair follicles.

The condition is usually associated with the hair of the head. It can affect any hairy area of the body, however, including the eyebrows and eyelashes.

While poliosis itself is not a harmful condition, it is associated with various other medical issues. Some of these are harmful, and some are not.

For this reason, it is a good idea for someone to get an opinion from a doctor when signs of poliosis first show up.

Symptoms and appearance

Poliosis is easy to spot. It shows up as a white or grey patch or patches in any area of the body that has hair. It will usually be easiest to notice when it affects the head hair, but it can occur anywhere else as well.

Poliosis may appear suddenly at any age. It is also possible for someone to have it from birth.

Causes



Poliosis may occur in conditions such as vitiligo, which causes white patches of skin.

A person can develop poliosis because of genetic conditions, such as the following:

tuberous sclerosis

piebaldism

Waardenburg syndrome

People can also develop poliosis due to the use of certain medications or developing other conditions, such as inflammatory disorders.

Medications that could trigger poliosis include the antibiotic chloramphenicol and the anticancer drug cetuximab.

There are also many well-documented historical reports of people suddenly experiencing poliosis due to extreme psychological stress, pain, or disease. A 2013 review of many of these reports was published in the International Journal of Trichology.

What conditions are associated with poliosis?

Poliosis itself is not harmful. It can, however, appear alongside other conditions that pose a health risk. For that reason, poliosis can be an early warning sign of more serious health issues.

Some of the harmful health conditions that poliosis might appear alongside include the following:

Skin conditions

Melanoma is a skin cancer arising from the cells that provide color to the skin. In certain cases of melanoma, poliosis can be the first sign of this cancer.

Eye conditions

Research published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, dating back to 1981, found that poliosis was more common in people experiencing the eye condition uveitis.

Uveitis involves an inflammation of the eye. If not treated, it might lead to other eye conditions, including glaucoma and cataracts.

Poliosis can, therefore, be a helpful warning sign for someone to seek treatment before an eye conditions develop.

Inflammatory diseases

Poliosis is known to occur as a late side effect of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH).

VKH is an inflammatory disorder that affects multiple systems throughout the body. These range from the eyes and ears to the skin and central nervous system. VKH is more common in dark-skinned people, particularly Asians.

As a 2012 review notes, there is a body of scientific evidence to suggest that chronic inflammation may be a significant factor in the development of many common diseases.

As poliosis is known to be a side effect of at least one chronic inflammatory disorder, its appearance could serve as a warning sign for any number of related conditions.

Thyroid disorders

A 2011 study published in the International Journal of Dermatology found that children with vitiligo, a related condition to poliosis that affects the skin, were more likely to experience thyroid and autoimmune disorders.

In the study, 42 percent of the children with vitiligo reported having at least one relative with a thyroid or autoimmune condition or both.

Thyroid conditions can have many negative effects if untreated. These include:

fatigue

trouble swallowing

depression

memory issues

raised cholesterol

low sex drive

weight gain

Treatment



Poliosis may be treated. However, treatment is usually intensive.

Image credit: DermNet New Zealand Poliosis may be treated. However, treatment is usually intensive.Image credit: DermNet New Zealand

There seem to be some medical treatments that can reverse poliosis.

One 2013 study published in Dermatological Surgery found that a skin grafting treatment, followed by light-therapy for 4–11 months, managed to reverse poliosis combined with vitiligo.

A 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology tested a treatment on a 37-year-old man with poliosis and vitiligo, affecting his left eyebrow.

The treatment involved therapy sessions with a laser, as well as daily applications of an ointment, and daily oral medication. At 6 months after the start of the treatment, and after 44 therapy sessions with the laser, 75 percent of the color had returned to the eyebrow.

These treatments are quite intensive and time-consuming.

Most people with poliosis might choose not to look for medical treatments, but instead let the hair remain as it is, or else dye it, as an easy way of covering up the white.

Summary

Poliosis itself is simply a harmless lack of pigment in hair follicles, which causes them to become white or gray. The condition can exist from birth, or it can appear without warning at any age.

While there is no need to be alarmed if poliosis appears, it is best to see a doctor if it does. While poliosis is not harmful, it can be a sign of various conditions that are.

The harmful conditions that can trigger poliosis include melanoma skin cancer, thyroid disorders, and inflammatory conditions, among others.

Poliosis can also be triggered by some medications and even by psychological stress.

Medical treatments do exist that appear to reverse poliosis, but these are often time-consuming, tiring, and expensive.

After seeing a doctor to make sure there is no underlying condition, a person with poliosis might find it easiest just to let their hair remain as it is, or else to dye it, rather than to seek other treatment.","international journal of dermatology

Catharine Paddock PhD,A new study in a mouse model of MS reveals two ways in which Th1 and Th17 immune cells cross the blood-barrier to attack the central nervous system.,2017-11-23T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Immune cells cross blood-brain barrier in multiple sclerosis,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320148.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320148/doctor-holding-brain-scans.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Researchers probing the mechanisms of nerve tissue damage in multiple sclerosis have identified two ways in which white blood cells overcome the blood-brain barrier to wreak havoc in the highly protected environment of the brain and spinal cord.



How do white blood cells penetrate the blood-brain barrier in MS? A new study investigates. How do white blood cells penetrate the blood-brain barrier in MS? A new study investigates.

In a paper published in the journal Cell Reports, first study author Sarah Lutz, assistant professor of anatomy and cell biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and colleagues describe how they studied mechanisms of immune attack on the central nervous system (CNS) in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Prof. Lutz explains that in MS, immune cells are able cause damage because they can gain entry to the brain and spinal cord from the bloodstream. ""A better understanding of how these cells cross the blood-brain barrier,"" she adds, ""will aid our efforts to develop specific therapies to keep them out.""

The bloodstream carries essential nutrients, oxygen, cells, and other substances to all parts of the body, including the CNS, which comprises the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.

The blood-brain barrier and 'tight junctions'

However, because of the delicate operations that go on in the CNS — such as the firing of neurons and passage of electrical signals that control movement and speech and carry information from the senses — it has a higher level of protection than the rest of the body.

One feature that can help the blood-brain barrier to restrict the movement of blood-borne cells, molecules, and ions into and out of the CNS is the close packaging of the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels that serve the CNS.

This close packing — which makes the blood vessels supplying the CNS virtually impermeable — comprises ""tight junctions"" of protein complexes that bolt the endothelial cells together.

In contrast, the junctions between endothelial cells in blood vessels that supply other organs and tissues are looser and can also be adjusted to allow a less restricted range of cells and other materials to pass through.

An autoimmune disease of the CNS

MS is a persistent autoimmune disease in which cells of the immune system attack the fatty layer of tissue that surround the nerve fibers, or axons, in the CNS, mistaking it for a disease agent or other threat.

The fatty layer of tissue is known as myelin, and it protects the electrical impulses that carry messages between the CNS and other parts of the body — such as movement muscles and the senses. In MS, however, the immune system degrades not only the myelin but can also damage the exposed axons.

The myelin damage occurs at multiple places in the CNS. These become lesions that harden into scar tissue, or sclerosis, hence the name of the disease.

MS has many different symptoms depending on which parts of the CNS are affected. They include, but are not limited to: impaired vision; blindness; difficulty remembering and concentrating; poor coordination; problems with balance; extreme fatigue; tremors; slurred speech; numbness; and paralysis.

Symptoms can flare up, go away, and then come back again, or they can stay and progressively worsen.

The disease is commonly diagnosed in people aged 20–50, but it can affect any person of any age. In the United States, there are thought to be around 1 million people living with MS.

Damaged 'tight junctions'

Scientists who are looking for MS's causes have discovered that two types of white blood cell, the lymphocytes Th1 and Th17, are involved in destroying the myelin sheath that protects the axons of the CNS. But until now, it was not clear how these immune cells managed to get across the blood-brain barrier into the CNS.

For their investigation, Prof. Lutz and her colleagues studied the blood-brain barrier of both healthy mice and mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice with EAE are often used as animal models in the study of MS.

To find out how the Th1 and Th17 immune cells get across the blood-brain barrier in MS, the team genetically labeled the tight junctions in the blood vessels using a fluorescent protein.

The scientists found that the tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier of the MS mice were much more damaged when Th17 cells were present, and that this damage seemed to occur in the very early stages of the disease.

Traveling through endothelial cells

Around 3 days after observing the damage that occurred in the presence of the Th17 immune cells, the researchers saw that the Th1 cells were attacking the myelin and damaging neurons.

However, these cells did not gain access to the CNS through the damaged tight junctions, but did so through another mechanism that involved passing through the endothelial cells themselves.

It appeared that the Th1 cells were able to use small pits, or ""caves,"" called ""caveolae."" These are found on the surfaces of cells — including endothelial cells — that are used to transport materials into and out of cells.

The researchers confirmed their findings by breeding MS mice without caveolae; they found hardly any Th1 immune cells in the CNS of these mice.

They concluded that the Th1 immune cells need the caveolae of the endothelial cells in the blood vessels that serve the CNS in order to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Prof. Lutz explains that that this was the first time that they had ever seen the different mechanisms through which the two types of immune cell got across the blood-brain barrier to reach the myelin and the axons ""in live animals in real-time.""","university of illinois

When following this diet, a person only eats one meal a day, usually dinner, and does not consume any other calories during the day.

Although this diet plan may help people find a fast weight loss solution, the risks may outweigh the benefits.

What is the one meal a day diet?



The one meal a day diet requires that a person only eat during 1 hour of a 24 hour day. The one meal a day diet requires that a person only eat during 1 hour of a 24 hour day.

The one meal a day diet is a weight loss plan that requires a person to eat only one meal per day. This is a type of intermittent fasting that involves alternating between extended periods of not eating or drinking anything with calories and periods of eating.

The one meal a day diet utilizes a type of intermittent fasting referred to as 23:1, meaning a person spends 23 hours of the day fasting, leaving just 1 hour a day to eat, drink and consume calories.

In the one meal a day diet, most people choose to not eat or drink anything with calories during the day. They break their fast when they eat dinner, then resume fasting until the following evening.

What do you eat on the one meal a day diet?

There are several variations of the one meal a day diet. Some variations suggest eating healthful, nutrient-rich foods, but most versions of the diet allow people to eat anything they want during their single meal.

Potential benefits

People who follow the one meal a day diet believe there are numerous benefits to eating this way, including rapid weight loss.

Other purported benefits include:

the diet is easy to follow because a person does not count calories

there are no ""cheat days"" because there are no foods considered off-limits

There have been several studies conducted on the effects of intermittent fasting. However, most of the studies have been carried out on men, so less is known about the effects of intermittent fasting on women.

Because of women's hormonal cycles, it is likely that the effects of intermittent fasting may be different in women. Women also have different nutritional requirements than men, including more iron, which may not be fulfilled while fasting.

The studies done on intermittent fasting show the following benefits:

Risks



Eating only one meal a day may cause weakness, exhaustion, and inability to focus. Eating only one meal a day may cause weakness, exhaustion, and inability to focus.

While some research supports the benefits of intermittent fasting and the one meal a day diet, an extreme diet plan comes with several risks.

The daily risks include:

becoming extremely hungry

shakiness

weakness

irritability

inability to concentrate

fatigue

There are also serious risks for people with underlying medical conditions. People with diabetes or low blood sugar, known as hypoglycemia, need to eat meals regularly throughout the day to avoid any serious side effects.

One study found that intermittent fasting raised LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol). Higher levels of LDL cholesterol are linked to increased rates of heart disease and stroke.

The same study also found that the participants following an intermittent fasting diet did not experience any more weight loss than those who who simply reduced the number of calories they ate each day.

Finally, people following the one meal a day diet may have an increased risk of binge eating.

Binge eating is a disordered pattern of eating where a person eats unusually large amounts of food in a short period, even after they are full. Some people that follow the one meal a day diet may even develop binge eating disorder.

Healthy weight loss options



Weight loss support groups and regular exercise are safer and more reliable methods for losing weight. Weight loss support groups and regular exercise are safer and more reliable methods for losing weight.

While the one meal a day diet may be appealing to people looking for quick weight loss solutions, there are other, less extreme ways to lose weight safely and healthily.

Anyone interested in losing weight should consider one of the following safer alternative ways to shed some pounds. These include:

Exercising regularly : People who want to lose weight should get at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise, such as running or aerobics, each week.

: People who want to lose weight should get at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise, such as running or aerobics, each week. Keeping a food diary : A person trying to lose weight can gain insight into their food intake by keeping a journal of food eaten and when.

: A person trying to lose weight can gain insight into their food intake by keeping a journal of food eaten and when. Getting support : People who are trying to lose weight find support from loved ones or fellow dieters valuable.

: People who are trying to lose weight find support from loved ones or fellow dieters valuable. Eating a balanced , nutritious diet: People looking to lose weight should eat enough fruits and vegetables and limit consumption of high-calorie junk food.

, nutritious diet: People looking to lose weight should eat enough fruits and vegetables and limit consumption of high-calorie junk food. Talking to a doctor: A doctor can check for any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid problems, that may be causing a person to hold on to unwanted weight.

The best weight loss solutions are sustainable, long-term changes to a person's diet and lifestyle.

Takeaway

The one meal a day diet is a weight loss plan based on the principle of eating only one meal a day and fasting for the rest of the time. Although this diet may help some people lose weight, other people may be frustrated by going for long periods of time without food.

The one meal a day diet is not the best choice for everyone, as some individuals may be more at risk for some adverse side effects.

While there are some research-backed benefits to intermittent fasting, more research needs to be done to verify if this diet is safe and effective for weight loss, particularly in women.

People who want to lose weight should start by making small, sustainable changes to their diet and lifestyle. It is best to consult a doctor on how to safely lose weight, particularly if a person has any underlying medical conditions.","cardiovascular

Most people will experience an episode of diarrhea at least once or twice a year that will disappear in a couple of days.

Luckily, there are many foods to eat that may help a person reduce the symptoms of diarrhea. There are also some foods to avoid when dealing with a bout of diarrhea, and some additional home care tips to consider.

Anyone who is experiencing persistent diarrhea should see a doctor, as a person may become dehydrated over time.

What is diarrhea?

Diarrhea is a bowel movement that is more liquid than solid or has a loose texture. It is a common problem and may occur a couple of times each year. Diarrhea will usually last no more than 3 days.



Soft, bland foods, such as toast, will help to absorb excess water and ease the symptoms of diarrhea. Soft, bland foods, such as toast, will help to absorb excess water and ease the symptoms of diarrhea.

People with chronic digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn's disease, may experience diarrhea more regularly.

In addition to loose or runny stools, diarrhea is also associated with other digestive symptoms, including:

cramps

abdominal bloating and pain

a bubbly feeling in the intestines

an urgent need to have a bowel movement

nausea

vomiting

fever

A person's diet is crucial if they are experiencing diarrhea. Some foods might help relieve symptoms of diarrhea while eating other foods can make diarrhea worse.

Foods to eat

While recovering from diarrhea, a person should eat bland, simple foods that are easy to digest and will help absorb some water from the stool.

Bland foods

People with diarrhea should eat bland foods, as spicy or complex foods can irritate the bowels. Bland foods that may help with diarrhea include:

hot cereals, such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, or rice porridge

bananas

applesauce

plain white rice

bread or toast

boiled potatoes

unseasoned crackers

These foods may be especially helpful on the first day of dealing with diarrhea. Eating many small meals throughout the day can help keep the digestive system from becoming overworked.

Probiotics

Probiotic foods, such as yogurt and kefir, may help in some cases, but in others, probiotics may irritate the digestive system even more.

Probiotics aid digestion by improving the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. However, dairy products can irritate the digestive system, so a person may wish to try non-dairy sources of probiotics, such as miso or sauerkraut.

What to drink

Liquids are also vital to recovery. People with diarrhea must drink plenty of water throughout the day and should drink an additional cup of water after every loose bowel movement.

Drinking plenty of water helps prevent dehydration and flush any toxins out of the body.



Soup broth will help to replace minerals and electrolytes lost because of diarrhea. Soup broth will help to replace minerals and electrolytes lost because of diarrhea.

However, as well as water, the body also loses minerals and electrolytes through diarrhea. People should try to drink liquids containing minerals and electrolytes to replenish those lost. Sources of electrolytes and minerals include:

soup broth

coconut water

electrolyte water

sports drinks

Foods to avoid

Many foods can aggravate the digestive system and make diarrhea worse. These include:

Spicy foods

Spicy ingredients can act as irritants in the digestive system. This is why people dealing with diarrhea should stick to bland foods, as they pose the least risk of agitating the digestive system.

Fried foods

It is not advisable to eat foods high in fat or oil when recovering from diarrhea. Added fats and oils from frying can be difficult for the sensitive digestive system to process and will likely make symptoms worse.

A person can try eating boiled or steam vegetables and lean proteins instead.

Sugary foods and artificial sweeteners

Sugars that pass into the colon may disrupt the already sensitive bacteria there, making diarrhea worse. This includes fruit juices and high-sugar fruits.

People with diarrhea should also avoid artificial sweeteners, as some can have a laxative effect.

High fiber foods

It may also help to avoid too much fiber. Fiber helps keep the digestive system active. Usually, this is a good thing, but when the body is trying to recover from diarrhea, fiber may make symptoms worse.

Insoluble fibers are the main culprit and can be found in foods such as:

whole grains, such as wheat, rice, and barley

whole grain bread or baked goods

grain cereals

nuts and seeds

Soluble fibers, such as the pectin found in apples and bananas, can actually help a person recover from diarrhea, but a person should still try to limit their intake at least for the first day of symptoms.

Other foods not to eat

Other foods that can irritate the bowels during diarrhea include:

onion and garlic

most processed, packaged food

raw vegetables

foods that produce gas in the intestines, such as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower

citrus fruits

fatty meats, including sardines, pork, and veal

dairy products

What not to drink



Carbonated or fizzy drinks should be avoided, as they can irritate the digestive system and make the symptoms of diarrhea worse. Carbonated or fizzy drinks should be avoided, as they can irritate the digestive system and make the symptoms of diarrhea worse.

Caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and soda, may overstimulate the digestive system and make symptoms worse.

Carbonated drinks may also irritate or contribute to other symptoms, such as bloating and cramps. People should also avoid alcohol while dealing with diarrhea.

While many sports drinks contain electrolytes that may help with dehydration, they often contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Coconut water or electrolyte-enhanced water are good alternatives.

Home care and treatment

In addition to following a diet that will help relieve diarrhea, there are several other steps a person can take to make a swift recovery.

Over-the-counter diarrhea treatments include bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) and Ioperamide (Imodium). These drugs can help relieve occasional cases of diarrhea and may be helpful to have on hand in a medicine cupboard.

People with diarrhea should also ensure they get enough rest, as putting the body in stressful situations while dealing with diarrhea may make matters worse. Physical activity may put the body at a greater risk of dehydration and should be limited.

When to see a doctor

Blood or mucus may appear in the stool in more serious cases of diarrhea. This is often accompanied by a fever and requires a visit to the doctor as soon as possible.

Untreated diarrhea can also lead to serious complications, including dehydration. A person with severe diarrhea may require hospitalization and intravenous electrolytes.

Anyone experiencing a fever of higher than 102°F or severe abdominal pains should visit a doctor.

Parents or guardians should carefully monitor any children with diarrhea. If symptoms do not clear up with 24 hours, they should call the doctor for guidance.

If a child shows any signs of dehydration, seek immediate medical care. Signs include:

dry mouth

dry diaper for longer than 3 hours

weight loss

crying without tears

Any additional symptoms should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment.

Outlook

Many cases of diarrhea last only a few days and respond well to home treatments. Eating a simple diet, increasing fluid intake, and using over-the-counter medications as necessary can help reduce symptoms quickly.

In cases where the body does not respond to these treatments after 2 or 3 days, a person should visit their doctor for diagnosis and treatment.","bismuth subsalicylate pepto bismol

This article examines its uses, benefits, and possible side effects.",2017-11-23T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,"Monophasic birth control: Types, benefits, and side effects",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320122.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320122/monophasic-birth-control-pills.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Monophasic birth control pills are a form of contraception. They contain equal amounts of the hormones estrogen and progestin for an entire monthly cycle.

For more than 50 years, birth control pills have given women the peace of mind of knowing that they won't get pregnant until they are ready for a baby. Around 82 percent of women who use contraception have used the pill, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The birth control pill has come a long way in those last 50 years, and there are many different options for women who use the pill for birth control. In this article, we take a look at monophasic pills specifically.

What are monophasic pills?



Monophasic birth control pills may be used to regulate the menstrual cycle and to treat PCOS, although they are mainly used to prevent pregnancy. Monophasic birth control pills may be used to regulate the menstrual cycle and to treat PCOS, although they are mainly used to prevent pregnancy.

One of the most common types of birth control pill is the combination pill. This type of pill contains both progestin and estrogen.

These two hormones work in several ways to prevent pregnancy:

by stopping ovulation or the release of a mature egg

by thickening cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to get past

by thinning the lining of the uterus, making implantation of an egg harder

The amount of estrogen and the kind of progestin is different in each brand and type of pill. Most pills have either 20 or 35 micrograms (mcg) of estrogen. There are different types of combination pills, depending on the quantity of hormones in each pack.

Monophasic pills have the same amount of estrogen and progestin throughout the entire month of pills.

Monophasic birth control pills are mostly used to prevent pregnancy in women who are sexually active, but there are many other uses as well. Some women, such as those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), use the pill to help regulate their menstrual cycles.

Also, the pill can improve menstrual cycle symptoms by:

reducing cramps and pain

lightening bleeding

easing premenstrual syndrome (PMS)

Medically, the use of the birth control pill may also improve bone density and bone health, and reduce the risk of ovarian and uterine cancer.

Multiphasic pills

In contrast to monophasic pills, multiphasic pills have varying amounts of estrogen and progestin in the pack of pills.

The most common type of multiphasic pills is triphasic, meaning that there are three different doses of estrogen in the pill pack.

This type of pill follows the changing hormone levels during a woman's menstrual cycle more closely.

Types and brands



Some people may find that they experience fewer side effects when taking monophasic birth control pills, compared with combined pills. Some people may find that they experience fewer side effects when taking monophasic birth control pills, compared with combined pills.

Monophasic pills come in either 21-day or 28-day pill packs. In both cases, these types of pills have the same amount of hormones for 21 days.

Women taking the 21-day formulation would take 21 days of active hormones, followed by 1 week of not taking pills.

Women taking the 28-day formulation would also take the 21 days of active hormones plus 7 days of placebo pills.

This 7-day break from active hormones is the time that a woman would have her period.

Monophasic pills are the most commonly prescribed type of birth control. There are many brands of monophasic pills, all having estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and a variety of progestin formulas.

This table lists various progestin combinations with examples of a brand name:

Progestin Estrogen Brand name examples levonorgestrel ethinyl estradiol Alesse, Aviane, Levlite, Levora, Nordette desogestrel ethinyl estradiol Apri, Desogen, Ortho-Cept norethindrone ethinyl estradiol Brevicon, Ortho-Novum, Modicon, Necon, Norinyl, Nortrel, Ovcon, Tri-Norinyl norethindrone mestranol Norinyl ethynodiol diacetate ethinyl estradiol Demulen, Zovia, Kelnor norethindrone acetate ethinyl estradiol Loestrin, Microgestin norgestrel ethinyl estradiol Lo-Ovral, Ovral drospirenone ethinyl estradiol Yasmin norgestimate ethinyl estradiol Ortho-Cyclen

A woman should keep in mind that some of these brands also make triphasic or biphasic pills with the same brand name.

People should always talk to their doctor if they have any medication questions or concerns.

Benefits of monophasic pills

Everyone's body reacts differently to the birth control pill. Some women experience fewer side effects when taking the monophasic pill because they are taking a steady level of hormones in their pill.

Also, women taking combination pills may have lighter periods with fewer cramps. Some types of pill have been associated with reduced acne.

Research has also shown that combination pills can reduce the risk of certain types of cancers, such as ovarian and endometrial.

Monophasic birth control pills are the most commonly prescribed and studied. This means that they have the most amount of research supporting their safety and efficacy. It does not mean, however, that this type of birth control is better, safer, or more effective than the other brands or types.

Side effects



A doctor or pharmacist can discuss the potential side effects of different types of birth control pills. A doctor or pharmacist can discuss the potential side effects of different types of birth control pills.

The side effects of monophasic birth control pills are the same as other types of birth control pills. They may include:

spotting or bleeding between periods

possible weight gain

nausea

mood changes or depression

breast tenderness

These symptoms are not usually anything to be concerned about, but it is always best for someone to discuss them with their doctor to be sure.

Birth control pills have also been linked with some serious medical conditions. Anyone experiencing any of the following side effects while taking the pill should contact their doctor immediately:

blurred vision

severe chest or abdominal pain

severe headache

pain or swelling in the legs

If the symptoms occur after-hours, someone should go to the nearest emergency room. These symptoms could signal the presence of a blood clot that can cause a stroke or heart attack.

Without prompt treatment, very serious complications or even death can occur.

Considerations

While using a monophasic birth control pill is usually safe, some women should not use the pill.

Women over the age of 35 years old, women who smoke, or women who have a history of previous blood clots should not use monophasic pills.

Before using the pill, women should also be warned about their risk for blood clots or other complications if they have any of the following medical conditions:

high blood pressure or chest pain

diabetes

severe headaches or migraines

heart or liver disease

stroke

Women who are breast-feeding should not take the combination birth control pill because of the risk that the estrogen in the pill can reduce milk production and supply. Lactating women who wish to use hormonal birth control should consider using a progestin-only pill to avoid this concern.

In addition, certain medications may not be as effective if taken with a birth control. Medications that may interact with the birth control pill include:

some antibiotics or antifungals

anti-seizure drugs

anti-HIV drugs

St. John's Wort

Women taking these drugs should be sure to mention it to their doctor and may want or need to use another form of birth control.

Takeaway

The monophasic birth control pill is a very safe and effective option for many women. When used correctly, it is 91–99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy.

It may take experimenting with a few different brands before the right pill is found, so it is important to stay in touch with the doctor and report any side effects.","levonorgestrel ethinyl estradiol alesse aviane levlite levora nordette desogestrel ethinyl estradiol apri desogen orthocept norethindrone ethinyl estradiol brevicon orthonovum modicon necon norinyl nortrel ovcon trinorinyl norethindrone mestranol norinyl ethynodiol diacetate ethinyl estradiol demulen zovia kelnor norethindrone acetate ethinyl estradiol loestrin microgestin norgestrel ethinyl estradiol loovral ovral drospirenone ethinyl estradiol yasmin norgestimate ethinyl estradiol

Maria Cohut,"After chemotherapy, many people report experiencing 'chemo brain,' characterized by impaired cognitive function. But could cancer itself be to blame?",2017-11-23T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,"More than just 'chemo brain': Cancer impacts memory, too",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320139.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320139/mature-woman-with-brain-fog.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"People undergoing cancer treatment often report experiencing ""chemo brain,"" or states of confusion and cognitive impairment due to aggressive chemotherapy treatment. But new research suggests that these cognitive problems might start earlier, with the development of cancer tumors.



Could 'chemo brain' be due to more than just chemotherapy? Researchers investigate. Could 'chemo brain' be due to more than just chemotherapy? Researchers investigate.

Researchers at the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto, Canada, conducted a study focusing on the ""chemo brain"" effect, with the purpose of understanding to what extent these states of cognitive impairment are caused by the treatment.

Lead author Dr. Gordon Winocur and his team conducted experiments in mice, which led them to observe that problems in learning and recall began to occur prior to chemotherapy in the animals with cancer.

""Our work,"" explains Dr. Winocur, ""isolated that the cancer is responsible for some of the memory and thinking complaints experienced by cancer survivors, and that drug therapy adds to the problem.""

He adds, ""Both factors independently affect brain function in different ways, which can lead to the development of other psychological disturbances, such as anxiety and depression.""

The team's findings were recently published in the journal Neuroscience.

Three brain changes impact cognition

Research covered by Medical News Today early this year indicated that chemo brain can severely impact people undergoing cancer treatment, with over 45 percent of breast cancer survivors reporting significantly impaired cognitive performance after chemotherapy.

In the current study, the researchers noted that female mouse models with breast cancer exhibited three distinct brain changes related to cognitive function, one of which was independent from exposure to chemotherapy.

First, they saw that the immune system reacts to the development of cancer tumors by releasing cytokines, which are a type of protein that play a key role in cell signaling. This is a natural response, with the aim of preventing the cancer from spreading further.

However, the study revealed that this immune system reaction also triggers inflammation of the nervous system, which affects normal brain functioning.

Secondly, they noticed that chemotherapy impaired neural regeneration in the hippocampus — the brain region largely responsibly for memory storage and recall — causing memory loss.

Finally, the development of cancer tumors alongside exposure to chemotherapy led to a decrease in frontal lobe and hippocampal volume. Both of these brain regions play a key role in memory formation and recall.

""Our research found that the cancer and chemotherapy cause three separate, but related brain changes. Understanding the nature of the cognitive impairment and the underlying biological mechanisms are essential to the development of an effective treatment for chemo brain."" Dr. Gordon Winocur

""Our work shows that a targeted approach addressing all three issues is necessary to successfully treat the condition,"" he adds.

Cancer tumors affect memory independently

For the purpose of this study, the scientists conducted experiments on female mice, half of which had breast cancer. The other half, which were cancer-free, were used as controls.

At baseline, all of the mice underwent targeted tests measuring learning and memory capacity. This allowed Dr. Winocur and team to gauge how cognitive function was impacted by cancer and chemotherapy.

Then, both the groups received three weekly injections of either methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil — which are drugs commonly used in chemotherapy — or a saline solution. The researchers then took scans of the mice's brains, as well as samples of blood and tissue, for analysis.

They found that the tumor-bearing mice exhibited reduced cognitive performance — compared with the control mice — even before exposure to the chemotherapy drugs, suggesting that memory and learning impairment actually begin with the development of cancer tumors.

Following the administration of chemotherapy drugs, cognitive function was impacted even further in tumor-bearing mice, and the healthy mice also exhibited memory and learning impairments.

""People are living longer thanks to more effective chemotherapy and cancer treatments,"" says Dr. Winocur, which is why ""[a]ddressing chemo brain will help improve a patient's quality of life since these side effects can lead to emotional and mental health issues that affect a person's ability to function in society.""

Further research, he explains, will focus on ways to counteract chemo brain more effectively, also taking into account the new findings that suggest that cancer itself plays an independent role in causing cognitive problems.

In older studies, Dr. Winocur and team found that drugs used to treat memory loss in Alzheimer's disease, paired with a physical exercise regime, could lessen the chemo brain effect, so next, he and his colleagues are interested in pursuing this line of investigation.","baycrest centre

However, there are some caveats.



Coffee is likely to be great for your health, suggests new research. Coffee is likely to be great for your health, suggests new research.

Here at Medical News Today, we often report on studies that examine the health benefits of coffee. And, much to our delight as drinkers of coffee, most of these studies bear good news.

One study, for example, suggested that coffee may drastically reduce the risk of early death in women with diabetes, while one more general study suggested that the beverage can lower the chances of heart failure or stroke.

Another one reported that coffee could halve the risk of premature mortality among those with HIV or hepatitis C. But how reliable are these studies? And, if you combined all of the research done on coffee and pooled together all of their conclusions, what would be the verdict?

New research explores precisely these aspects. The study was led by Dr. Robin Poole, a specialist registrar in public health at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom, and the findings were published in The BMJ.

'Largest risk reduction' at three to four cups

Dr. Poole and colleagues examined 201 meta-analyses of existing observational studies, and 17 meta-analyses of clinical trials.

Overall, the team found that moderate coffee consumption is ""more likely to benefit health than to harm it."" Moderate coffee intake is usually considered to be around four or five daily cups, or the equivalent of up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day.

More specifically, the researchers found that coffee intake was linked with a decrease in the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and diabetes.

Additionally, the beverage correlated with a lower risk of mortality from all causes, as well as mortality from cardiovascular disease in particular.

""Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake,"" write the researchers, ""with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day.""

In fact, three cups of coffee per day lowered the risk of coronary heart disease by 19 percent, and that of mortality from stroke by 30 percent. A high coffee intake was linked with an 18 percent decrease in cancer risk, compared with a low intake.

The greatest risk reduction was noticed for liver cirrhosis: ""any versus no coffee consumption"" was linked to a 39 percent lower risk of developing this condition.

However, the authors caution that most existing studies on the benefits of coffee are ""of lower quality,"" as they are merely observational and do not explain causality.

So, the authors urge that ""robust randomized controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal.""

'Coffee is safe, but hold the cake'

In an accompanying editorial, Eliseo Guallar — from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, MD — comments on the findings. ""Should doctors recommend drinking coffee to prevent disease? Should people start drinking coffee for health reasons? The answer to both questions is 'no.'""

""The evidence is so robust and consistent across studies and health outcomes, however, that we can be reassured that drinking coffee is generally safe,"" he continues.

However, women at risk of bone fractures and those who are pregnant may not derive the same health benefits from coffee, the research revealed.

Finally, Guallar cautions that drinking coffee is sometimes linked with less healthful habits, such as eating sugary cakes or other fatty products. ""Coffee is safe, but hold the cake,"" he writes.

All in all, however, the benefits seem to outweigh the risks.","johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health

It is also low in calories.

As the name implies, eggs are a big part of this diet, and they are also one of its main sources of protein. In some versions of the diet, eggs are the only food eaten.

In this article, we look at whether this fad diet has any merits and whether it is healthful and safe to try.

Egg diet meal plan



The egg diet is high in protein and low in both carbohydrates and calories. The egg diet is high in protein and low in both carbohydrates and calories.

There are several different versions of the egg diet. In each one, eggs are the main source of protein.

Starchy carbohydrates, such as potatoes, rice, and bread are not allowed. Sweets and foods high in sugar are also eliminated from the diet.

Water and zero calorie beverages are permitted in all versions of the egg diet.

The exact amount of calories and servings recommended in the egg diet vary depending on a person's sex, height, and activity level.

Eggs that are boiled, poached, or scrambled are permitted, but they should be prepared without butter or oil.

The main versions of the egg diet include:

Traditional egg diet

In the traditional egg diet, protein from other sources is allowed. The traditional egg diet is the most popular version and is similar to other diets with high protein and low carbohydrates.

Lean protein and low carbohydrate vegetables, such as kale, broccoli, and spinach, are allowed. Fruits are usually limited to 1 or 2 servings a day.

Carbohydrates, such as pasta, bread, and rice, are off limits.

An example of a meal plan could include:

Breakfast : Two eggs and a low-carb vegetable.

: Two eggs and a low-carb vegetable. Lunch : Lean protein with a green salad.

: Lean protein with a green salad. Dinner: Eggs or lean protein and low-carb vegetables.

Egg and grapefruit diet

On this meal plan, a person follows the same low carbohydrate, high protein guidelines as above. They also eat half a grapefruit with each meal.

An example of a meal plan could include:

Breakfast : Two eggs and half a grapefruit.

: Two eggs and half a grapefruit. Lunch : One serving of lean protein with spinach and half a grapefruit.

: One serving of lean protein with spinach and half a grapefruit. Dinner: One serving of lean protein, such as fish or eggs, with half a grapefruit.

Extreme egg diet

This version of the egg diet only allows for eggs and water at every meal. It is very strict and probably difficult for most people to stick with for any length of time.

Eating one type of food is not a safe way to lose weight. The extreme egg diet is not recommended and may lead to nutritional deficiencies.

Is it effective?

All versions of the egg diet result in eating fewer calories, so maybe effective for losing weight in the short-term. The diet is high in protein, which has been shown to help with weight loss.

In a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, research indicated that a high protein diet helped participants feel full and lose weight.

Eggs are also a good source of protein and contain important vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B-12, vitamin D, and iron.

Although eggs do contain essential nutrients and weight loss may occur, an egg diet may not be the best approach for losing weight and keeping it off.

Even if a person does lose weight, they are unlikely to maintain such a strict diet long-term, so they may easily regain what they have lost.

Also, the diet may leave some people fatigued and sluggish throughout the day because of its carbohydrate restrictions.

Is it safe?



The egg diet could cause constipation, as eggs do not contain any fiber. The egg diet could cause constipation, as eggs do not contain any fiber.

Eggs can be a healthy protein source when eaten in moderation, but they are also high in cholesterol.

Some research has indicated that eating eggs in high quantities may increase the risk of certain medical conditions.

One study found that eating more than six eggs a week increased the risk of heart failure by 30 percent in men, although not for women.

The same study also reported that both women and men who ate six eggs or less per week did not have an increased risk of a heart attack, hemorrhagic stroke, or heart failure. A hemorrhagic stroke involves ruptured blood vessels in the brain.

The safety of the egg diet also depends on the version that is followed. Eating only eggs at every meal is not a well-balanced diet and is unsafe, as it can result in nutritional deficiencies.

Also, eggs do not contain any fiber. Eating only eggs may disrupt proper digestive function and lead to constipation.

High protein and low carbohydrate diets may also cause unwanted side effects, including fatigue, headaches, and nausea. Others can include bad breath, muscle cramps, and digestive problems.

Takeaway



Any weight loss could be regained as it may be difficult to persevere with the egg diet. Any weight loss could be regained as it may be difficult to persevere with the egg diet.

The egg diet may be just another fad diet. Although eggs can be a healthful source of protein, they should not be the only food a person eats.

While people may lose weight initially, the egg diet is neither a well-balanced diet nor a safe weight loss plan in the long-term.

Although the traditional egg diet allows other sources of lean protein and vegetables, it is also restrictive and may lead to unwanted side effects.

For most people, it may be hard to stick with the egg diet. Once most people go back to their old eating habits, they may regain the weight they have lost.

The bottom-line is there are better ways to lose weight than the egg diet. Making sustainable changes, such as cutting out processed foods, reducing meat and dairy intake, and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, can help a person maintain a healthy weight over time.","american journal of clinical nutrition research

Photograph by Rafael de Fraga

Scientists have discovered a new species of tree frog in an unusual place—a stretch of abandoned highway in Brazil.

When herpetologists first heard male frogs calling in the Amazon rain forest, they suspected the unknown sound came from a species completely new to science. Rafael de Fraga, a herpetologist at the National Institute of Research of the Amazon, and colleagues later confirmed it via genetic analysis.

The team named the species Scinax onca, or the jaguar snouted tree frog, due to its spotted skin and the prevalence of big cats they found in the area.

""During the sampling expeditions we were also lucky enough to spot several jaguars,"" says de Fraga, who noted the sightings unnerved some of his team.

But, he noted, ""the highway is definitely more dangerous than jaguars [because] many people have died there by car crash or fallen bridges.""

The newfound frog is the 27th species of Scinax—the snouted genus of tree frogs—known from the Amazon Basin. There are more than 800 species of tree frogs worldwide. (Read about three warty toad species found in Brazil.)

The confluence of the Purus and Madeira Rivers where the frog lives is ""very special from a biological point of view,"" de Fraga says. That's because it is home to a diverse array of species, including the closely related Scinax iquitorum tree frog.

A Fleeting Find?

So far, not much is known about the newly identified creature, described in a recent study in the journal Zookeys.

The orange-eyed frog measures less than two inches and has a white groin with black spots. It's also sexually dimorphic, meaning female frogs are larger than males.

De Fraga says the amphibian's scratchy call sounds like a woodsaw, and the male's mating trill lasts a little over 100 milliseconds. (See more tree frog pictures.)

""[The discovery is] not a huge surprise, but it's indicative of kind of a push within Brazil to understand the environment,"" says Darrel Frost, curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, who wasn't involved in the study.

Stunning Close-ups: Meet These Frogs Before They Go Extinct WATCH: A National Geographic explorer is working to save the charismatic tree frogs of Cusuco National Park from a pathogen that has decimated entire species.

De Fraga suspects the frog is endangered, and is further imperiled by plans to recover the derelict highway, which will likely lead to habitat destruction for several species.

""We are not totally opposed to the highway recovering, because many local people live completely isolated from basic resources such as hospitals,"" de Fraga says.","charismatic tree frogs of cusuco national park

This story appears in the December 2017 issue of National Geographic magazine.

The snake charmer. The yarn threader. The broommaker. Traditional jobs in India can be as varied and distinctive as the country’s bright colors and rich flavors. That occupational diversity is on display in “Marginal Trades,” photographer Supranav Dash’s portrait series showcasing people at work, primarily in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.

The jobs Dash portrays—making sweets, for example, or cow-dung cakes for fuel—are vanishing, and with them goes a social hierarchy that’s held for centuries. For many people in India, the caste system has long determined one’s occupation. But now that public discrimination based on caste has been banned, Dash sees more young people ignoring caste-based limitations, including restrictions on what livelihoods they can pursue. “They just don’t seem to care,” says Dash, who grew up in Kolkata.

Many of the workers whose trades are waning—especially artisans—are at the mercy of economic as well as cultural forces. “The major threat to crafts and traditional jobs is technology,” says Indian economist Shyam Sundar. Cups once made by hand can be mass-produced from plastic. Individual goldsmiths can’t compete with newly built factories.","burirchul wallah

Many areas on the outskirts are newly lit compared to 2010, and many neighborhoods have switched from orange sodium lamps to white LED lamps.

Photographs by NASA's Earth Observatory/Kyba, GFZ

As people across the globe are switching to LED lights in an effort to save energy and money, they may be making another problem worse.

Light pollution has been a growing problem for decades, and the recent introduction of LED (light emitting diode) bulbs has increased the amount of light coming from cities by a considerable amount.

A global study led by Christopher Kyba from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geoscience, the results of which were published in Science Advances, found that the amount of artificial light coming from Earth’s surface at night has increased in radiance and extent by 2 percent every year for the past four years—driven by the rapid adoption of bright LEDs and development.

Where Are the Stars? See How Light Pollution Affects Night Skies This short film, shot mainly in California by Sriram Murali and included in Nat Geo's Short Film Showcase, goes through all the levels of the scale of light pollution, showing how the view of the cosmos gets better in less light-polluted areas.

Scientists observed light pollution by mounting a radiometer designed especially for nighttime lights to a NOAA satellite that orbited the Earth for four years. They found that the fastest increase in the amount of artificial light is coming from developing countries, and the growth in light pollution corresponds to the global growth of gross domestic product.

In addition to the light that has been measured, more light pollution is going undetected because the sensor used in the study cannot measure light below 500 nanometers, including some of the blue light that LED bulbs emit.

Light pollution, particularly the blue light emitted by LED bulbs, doesn’t just make it hard to stargaze. It can cause serious consequences for wildlife, whose biological rhythms and nocturnal instincts are disrupted when they are near a lot of artificial light. In humans, it can disrupt circadian rhythms and make it harder to see when driving at night. And in some cases, it can even make spring arrive early.","nasas earth observatorykyba gfz

Watch how whales exfoliate.,2017-11-22T19:00:00Z,national-geographic,See What Happens at a ‘Day Spa’ for Whales,https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/whales-skin-spa-oceans-animals-science.html,https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/507/23/smpost_1511300196638.jpg,science-and-nature,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Watch These Giant Whales Visit an Ocean ‘Day Spa’ These bowhead whales pamper themselves by exfoliating their skin using rocks.

To graduate student Sarah Fortune, the rocky crags off Baffin Island were just part of its stark beauty. Then, she saw a group of eight bowhead whales rubbing their bodies against the large boulders. Using aerial drones to watch the whales, she saw that they were using the rocks to help remove loose, dead skin.

“It was like a bowhead whale day spa,” she says.

It’s the first time scientists have documented this behavior in bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), Fortune reports Wednesday in the journal PLoS ONE.

“This is really exciting. I’ve heard about this in beluga whales and orcas, but never in bowheads,” says Paul Anderson, a research scientist at Mystic Aquarium who was not involved in the study.

Scratch My Back

Fortune, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia, didn’t set out to identify pumice stones for bowheads. Instead, she wanted to see how climate change affected their feeding behaviors. To track the whales in the frigid Arctic waters separating Baffin Island and Greenland, she placed sticky tags on the whales’ backs. When a tag’s signal died suddenly on the second whale she tracked, Fortune chalked it up to a malfunction.

But then she noticed the group of whales rubbing against boulders strewn around Cumberland Sound. A closer look revealed large patches of loose, dead skin all over their bodies.

The whales, Fortune realized, were shedding the top layer of dead skin, a process known as molting. What’s more, they were using the rocks to exfoliate. A sample of the water revealed few of the zooplankton that make up the entirety of the bowhead whale diet, which meant they were in Cumberland Sound specifically to use the rocks to assist molting.

In the summer of 2016, Fortune returned to Cumberland Sound, this time armed with aerial drones to monitor the whales’ behavior without disturbing them. Her footage revealed that all 81 whales in the area had signs of sloughing skin, and for 40 percent of them it covered at least two-thirds of their body.

Anderson had previously documented the same process in beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), which also make their home in the Canadian Arctic. Unlike bowheads, belugas will travel hundreds of miles to reach their “day spa” on the Cunningham Inlet along Somerset Island, to the northwest of Baffin.

“They do what we call the “caterpillar,” moving in close to shore and rubbing against rocks. The warm fresh water flowing into the inlet helps to soften and hydrate their skin,” Anderson says.

Shed That Skin

Whales aren’t the only animals that molt: Insects and reptiles shed their outer covering of skin in order to grow. Birds and many mammals also undergo an analogous process, and Anderson says the same glands are responsible for molting in birds and other mammals, including whales.

Rare White Whale Spotted Near Australia An extremely rare white whale has been spotted off the east coast of Australia.

Fortune hypothesizes that molting may help remove parasites such as whale lice and diatoms or to remove sun-damaged skin, both of which can harm whales’ health. The relatively warm waters in Cumberland Sound may make it easier for the whales to shed their skin.

Anderson believes the process may also help improve what’s known as hydrodynamic efficiency, a measure of how much effort it takes to move in the water. Gouges from rocks, other whales, and even ships can all roughen the skin and slow whales down.","university of british columbia

Americans may be working hard this weekend to stuff their faces with a plethora of turkey, sides, and pie, but when it comes to animals biting off more than they can chew, pythons have us beat.

Video of a python regurgitating a large monitor lizard made its rounds on the Internet this week, and it's easy to see why. A python in Thailand slowly regurgitates a fully intact lizard that's several feet long (it's very much dead).

Initially the tail end of the lizard is visible protruding from the expanded jaws of the python. Slowly moving backward, the python releases the monitor lizard bit-by-bit. Left behind is the corpse of a lizard next to the snake sitting in the back of a truck.

According to local media, the python was being transported to a reserve where it was set to be released into the forest. It was found under a patio adjacent to a woman's house. A wildlife control team was called to remove the animal from the urban setting. The team broke concrete to extract the snake.

The video offers a look at a unique defense mechanism deployed by snakes.

When under duress, snakes need to be agile to either make a quick getaway or attack their opponents. After a large meal, however, is one of the worst times for a snake to be attacked. While snakes like pythons have fangs to grasp their prey, they don’t use these teeth to chew their food.

Instead, the reptiles swallow their prey whole and digestive enzymes slowly break the food down. The whole process can take weeks for large prey.

""When they swallow something relatively large, it can make them less mobile, so when they're harassed, it's common for them to regurgitate the meal,"" Max Nickerson, the herpetology curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History, said in a prior interview with National Geographic.

While the habit is common in a variety of snake species, pythons tend to regurgitate the most surprising meals because the snakes themselves are huge. On average, a Burmese python like the one seen in the video can reach 200 pounds and be as long as 23 feet.

They've previously been filmed regurgitating an antelope.","museum of natural

To the ancient Aztec and Maya, man's best friend was also a hairless, ugly-cute healer, occasional food source, and, most importantly, guide to the Underworld.

Sometimes known as the Mexican Hairless dog, the xoloitzcuintli (pronounced ""show-low-itz-QUEENT-ly"") gets its name from two words in the language of the Aztecs: Xolotl, the god of lightning and death, and itzcuintli, or dog. According to Aztec belief, the Dog of Xolotl was created by the god to guard the living and guide the souls of the dead through the dangers of Mictlán, the Underworld.

This Ugly-Cute Hairless Dog Has a Surprising History

One of the most ancient dog breeds of the Americas, researchers believe the ancestors of the xoloitzcuintli (or 'xolo' for short) accompanied the earliest migrants from Asia and had developed into the breed seen today by at least 3,500 years ago. The xolo's hairlessness (save for a tuft or two of hair on top of the head or on the tail) is the result of a genetic mutation that is also responsible for the dog's lack of premolars. This distinctive dental trait makes identifying the remains of xolos in archaeological contexts relatively easy.

Xolos appear in ancient Mesoamerican art often with pointed ears and wrinkly skin to indicate their hairlessness. The most frequent depictions take the form of small ceramic vessels known as Colima Dogs for the modern state in western Mexico where they are commonly found. In Colima and the neighboring states of Nayarit and Jalsico, archaeologists estimate that more than 75 percent of burials from the Preclassic period (ca. 300 B.C to A.D. 300) contain these vessels, which may have served as symbolic dog guides to help the soul of the dead travel through the Underworld.

These hairless canines also caught the eye of European chroniclers such as Christopher Columbus and the 16th-century Spanish missionary Bernadino de Sahagún, who describes how the Aztecs would tuck xolos in blankets at night to keep them warm. The dogs' fur-free bodies also serve as excellent heat conductors, making them a kind of ancient hot-water bottle for the ill and the elderly. ""They know when you're sick,"" observes Kay Lawson, a 20-year xolo breeder and past president of the Xoloitzcuintli Club of America. ""They zero right in to where it hurts.""

Along with turkeys, xolos were one of the only domesticated animals eaten by ancient Mesoamericans. The conquistadors developed such an appetite for the convenient canine protein source when they arrived in the New World that they nearly ate the xoloitzcuintli into oblivion, says archaeologist Marc Thompson, director of the Tijeras Pueblo Museum.

By the time the xolo was officially recognized in Mexico in 1956, the breed was nearly extinct. Today, however, these ancient dogs are experiencing a revival, especially among people who are allergic to their furry counterparts. But they're not for everyone, Lawson warns.","tijeras pueblo museum

Cinnamon Janzer,"River surfing was inspired by ocean surfing, but its popularity is growing all on its own.",2017-11-22T16:42:53Z,national-geographic,This Freshwater Sport is Taking on Its Saltwater Sister,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/lists/surfing/river-surfing-best-spots-history.html,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/adventure/photos/2017/stories/river-surfing/river-surfing-west-virginia.jpg,science-and-nature,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"View Images A surfer and kayaker ride a wave on the lower Gauley River near Fayatteville, West Virginia.

Traditional surfing began more than 3,000 years ago in Western Polynesia. First making its way to Hawaii, the sport has since spread across the globe, leaving in its wake wave-chasers from all corners of the planet—even land-locked locales. Some ambitious surfers hungry for waves but without coastline have turned to river surfing, a take on the original sport that delivers a similar experience in ocean-less conditions. “You see these [river] waves and think ‘Hey, I can probably surf that,’” says Alex Mauer, a professional stand-up paddleboarder and avid river surfer based in Littleton, Colorado.

In 1970’s Munich, a small group of adventurous surfers took to the Eisbach River near Englischer Garten Park. Holding tight to two ropes attached to a bridge, they balanced on wooden planks in the river to mimic the ocean surfing they had encountered abroad. This is the moment many river surfers believe the sport was born. “Eisbach—that wave is considered the mother of all river waves. Every wave they’re constructing now is emulated after that wave,” explains Mauer.

Unlike ocean waves, which are largely created by wind, river waves are formed either by water flowing quickly downstream over a drop in elevation, creating standing waves, or by tidal bores , which occur where rivers meet the sea. The unique characteristics of individual standing waves, like ocean waves, depend on the specific conditions of the factors that create them. The speed of the water dictates the energy of a wave, while the length of the drop decides its size. Because the thickness of a wave also matters (boards can’t glide over the rocks and other debris if there’s just a few inches of water), the size of the river channel is also important. Rideable waves can occur with slow flow and small drop conditions if the river channel is narrow enough to create a thick wave, and the opposite is true for wide channels.

There could be thousands of river waves across the States that people haven’t seen yet. Alex Mauer Stand-up Paddleboarder and River Surfer

Many ocean surf spots have become well-known and overpopulated, forcing athletes to search for uncrowded waves in extreme environments, like the frigid waters of Iceland. River surfing, however, is full of uncharted territory. “One of the cool things [about river surfing] is there could be thousands of river waves across the States that people haven’t seen yet,” Mauer says. Because flow can change from day to day and season to season, thanks to a previous winter’s snowfall or other natural phenomenon, even an expert has to be at the right spot on the right day to discover a surfable river wave.

Of the river waves that have been found and named, as ocean waves often are, there are a handful across the U.S. that are particularly worth checking out. Don’t forget your personal flotation device and, for rocky or debris-filled rivers, a helmet.

The Glove and The Right:

Glenwood Springs, Colorado

An artificial wave created on the Colorado River as part of the Glenwood Springs Whitewater Park, this feature consists of two separate waves, one on the right and one on the left. The two waves blend together to form one wide wave during high water levels. Interested surfers can check the conditions on the park’s webcams before hitting the water.

Lunch Counter:

Jackson, Wyoming

Located just outside Jackson on the Snake River is Lunch Counter, a standing wave that can be treacherous to catch but fun to ride. Lunch Counter gives skilled riders the opportunity for minutes-long carving sessions, while the extra challenge of staying out of the way of rafts and boats, which always have the right of way, on the journey downstream keeps things interesting.

Brennan’s is a man-made wave on the Clark Fork River that delights kayakers and surfers alike from early spring until it begins to freeze in late fall or early winter. This feature is named after a Missoula native and world-class kayaker, Brennan Guth, who died in 2001 while paddling in Chile.

Benihana’s and Chiclets:

Sheridan, Colorado

Part of River Run Park, Benihana’s and Chiclets are adjustable artificial waves that can be tailored to each day’s particular flow rate. Benihana’s, which is considered by many to be the best wave in the state, is located upstream and is better suited for more advanced surfers, while Chiclets is a good option for beginners.

Europe attracts more international tourists than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. The staggering 616 million people that visited the continent last year faced the tough choice of dozens of destinations, each offering stimulating history, diverse classes of creatives, and epic landscapes. France seduced the most travelers by far, but what about last place?

Hovering on a cliff encircled by Italy, the tiny landlocked country of San Marino holds the title of the least visited country in Europe, just a dot on the map of only 23.6 square miles. Here’s why travelers of all types should visit the under the radar microstate.

FOR HISTORY BUFFS

Founded in the fourth century and one of the world’s oldest republics, San Marino survived from the time when city-states proliferated across Europe—a critical stage for developing democratic models across the globe. Ramble around the car-free capital also named San Marino, a UNESCO World Heritage site with a medievalized layout punctuated by three imposing fortresses standing testimony to a turbulent past.

FOR EPIC LANDSCAPES

The Mount Titano, part of the Apennine range, dominates San Marino's landscape surrounded by Italy with clear views all the way to the Adriatic Sea. Old stone benches pepper the slopes offering place to bask in the greenery stretching to the outlying villages. Ride the funicular from one such town, Borgo Maggiore, to the historic center for sweeping views of Italy in every direction.

FOR FOODIES

All the rules of northern Italian food apply here too, with a strong tradition in cheesemaking. Sammarinese cuisine, heavy on pasta and meat dishes, balances the rich and fresh with locally-sourced ingredients. The area holds particular fondness for the filled flatbread called piada, similar to a piadina from the encompassing Emilia-Romagna region. Don’t forget the wine: San Marino produced wine for almost two thousand years, aging the bottles in the area caves for optimal temperatures.

FOR ARCHITECTURE FANS

Visitors weave through time in the living history museum of the historic capital, home to 14th and 16th century convents, 18th century Titano Theatre, and a neoclassical basilica built in the 19th century. The centerpiece Palazzo Pubblico echos Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio on a much smaller scale.

FOR SAVVY SHOPPERS

The tax-free policy of San Marino makes shopping cheaper than nearby Italy. Mid-century modern ceramics captivate collectors, along with postage stamps created in the late 19th century for use only within the state's borders.

""Every day people ask if we keep [the] Bride of Chucky,"" says Manuela Cutileiro, a certified “doll surgeon” at Hospital de Bonecas. Established in 1830 in Lisbon’s bustling Praça da Figueira, it’s considered the oldest surviving doll hospital that continues to operate from its original location. Here, dolls of all kinds—plastic, porcelain, metal, wool and fabric—will receive a new lease on life.

The waiting list runs around four months and those in need of care paint a somewhat macabre picture: chipped faces, fractured arms, gaping ruby-stained lips, and missing eyes.

From elaborately-costumed German porcelain dolls in glass-fronted armoires to a black doll made in 1915 in Angola— Cutileiro, a former primary school teacher, is far from spooked by her motley crew of patients.

Some of their stories have been lost to time. Others traveled with immigrants and refugees and now represent a family’s singular possession left from home. “We don’t value one over another here, though,” Cutileiro says. “To us, all the dolls are valuable.”

The dolls are tagged with admission date and their ailments, and rest in cubicles, or “beds,” while awaiting treatment. Nearby, cabinets filled with little arms, legs, eyes, and even wigs are the medicines of choice. The work is painstaking and Cutileiro along with three additional “surgeons” possess certifications from Fundaçao Ricardo Espírito Santo, a museum and cultural center whose mission is to protect and conserve traditional arts. Once healed and patched up, the dolls are ready to return to the loving arms of an owner.

This building was once a hospital for humans, and Cutileiro is part of the fourth generation of family and friends to work in the shop. It once belonged to Carlota da Silva Luz, her father’s godmother. When Lilia Dinah da Silva Luz Tavares was next in line with no heirs of her own, Cutileiro, who was like a daughter to her, took over.

""I often visit schools and I speak with the children,” Cutileiro says. “If we get ill or break our arms, are we to be thrown away? Is this how we will treat our family and friends one day?"" She believes the Portuguese have always been afflicted by some economic crisis or another, and combined with an innate sentimentality or suadade—a gnawing sense of nostalgia—repairing toys makes perfect sense here.

John Nicholson, told NBC News Thursday that the war here remains in a ""stalemate,"" but that President Donald Trump's new strategy has reversed a decline in the U.S. position.

""We are still in a stalemate,"" Nicholson, a four-star Army general said in an exclusive interview. ""We are only 90 days into this new policy, but with the U.S. forces that will be arriving, with the new authority that we have been given, put the pressure on external enablers, with the fact that we are condition based and not time based, we've set all the conditions to win.""

Nicholson also called out Russia and Pakistan, specifically, for enabling the Taliban and explained his decision to detonate a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb — known colloquially as the ""Mother of All Bombs"" — in April. He also said he has the confidence of the president.

Nicholson's assessment of the overall status of the Afghanistan war largely tracked with a more upbeat-sounding version Trump gave in a video conference Thursday morning with members of the Army's 82nd Airborne First Brigade Combat Team here.

""I have to say just directly to the folks in Afghanistan: Everybody’s talking about the progress you’ve made in the last few months since I opened it up,"" Trump said. ""We opened it up, we said go ahead, we’re going to fight to win. We’re not fighting anymore to just walk around; we’re fighting to win, and you people are really — you’ve turned it around over the last three to four months like nobody’s seen.""

Trump outlined his strategy in an August speech, which was followed up by the deployment of 3,000 additional troops — including those from the 82nd Airborne — in an effort to suppress terrorism and perhaps bring about a political settlement with the Taliban and other groups involved in the fighting.

Nicholson, who also told lawmakers in February that the war was at a stalemate, said Thursday that the new strategy has provided momentum for the U.S. and its allies.

""This change in policy has reversed this decline that we've been in since 2011,"" Nicholson said. ""And what I would say is that we've drawn down too far and too fast, we communicated to the enemy that we had lost our will to win, and now with a new policy as of August, we are going to win. And winning means delivering a negotiated settlement that reduces the level of violence and protecting the homeland.""

As Trump considered his options in Afghanistan this summer, he became frustrated with the lack of progress and even suggested that he might fire Nicholson for failing to win the war. Instead, he reversed his previous calls to pull out of Afghanistan and followed the advice of his military advisers.

Now, Nicholson said Thursday, he believes the president has confidence in him.

That's ""because of the authorities I've been given and the policy we've received"" in August, he said. ""It's everything I asked for.""

Nicholson's had less luck with Pakistan, a powerful player in the region that has provided support to the Taliban. He said that has to be resolved at the diplomatic level.

""That's up to the senior leaders of our government,"" he said. ""It's a political conversation between our two capitals, and here on the ground we are hoping to see a reduction with that support. The bottom line is the Taliban cannot win.""

Similarly, the U.S. hasn't been able to prevent Russia from providing aid to the Taliban, even though Nicholson said the two countries have common interests in fighting ISIS and cracking down on the flow of heroin out of Afghanistan.

""The Russians themselves have legitimized the Taliban,"" he said. ""We see indications that the Taliban themselves and the open media talk about Russians giving them fuel, and raise money for their operations, so there are many, many indicators of this.""

Asked whether that fuel includes small arms or even more powerful munitions, Nicholson said, ""We've heard reports of those, yeah.""

On the other end of the weapons spectrum, it was Nicholson who ordered the first use of America's largest conventional bomb, the MOAB, in Afghanistan in April.

The 11-ton bomb was deployed because ""other ammunitions were ineffective"" in trying to damage a network of ISIS-held tunnels and caves, Nicholson said.

Now, some lawmakers are talking about turning that scrutiny into action.

There are new calls on Capitol Hill for stronger federal regulation of Facebook, possibly requiring greater transparency and disclosures for digital political ads. But lawmakers have yet to take up more sweeping reforms that some internet policy experts and advocates believe are necessary to protect users of the social-media platform, given Facebook’s outsize influence and vast stores of personal data.

In early September, Facebook said it had traced $100,000 in politically motivated ads that ran during the 2016 presidential campaign to a Russian troll farm, reaching about 10 million people. Testifying before Congress a few weeks later, Facebook officials revealed that the total audience for Russian-backed content was many times larger, reaching an estimated 126 million Americans — a third of the U.S. population — during the 2016 campaign.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) looks on as Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) speaks during a press conference to introduce the 'Honest Ads Act,' on Capitol Hill, Oct. 19, 2017 in Washington, DC.

In response, two Democratic senators, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia, together with Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, introduced a bill last month that would require large online platforms to maintain public files of political ads, including who purchased the ads, the targeted audience and the number of views they generated. The legislation would also require these platforms to “make all reasonable efforts” to guarantee that foreign entities and individuals aren’t buying political ads to influence American elections.

The authors of the bill intentionally limited its scope in order to have the best possible shot at passage, said Rachel Cohen, a spokesman for Warner. “It was intended to be the lightest possible touch,” she said. “When you go further in legislation, it gets more difficult.”

The bill has also attracted bipartisan support in the House, where it was introduced by Rep. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., and Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo.

“This is a very good start in terms of setting up expectations of transparency and disclosure,” said Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., House chairman of his party’s Democracy Reform Task Force. “Online platforms have a great deal of political power.”

When Klobuchar asked last month at a Senate hearing whether Facebook would support the bill, the company was noncommittal.

“We stand ready to work with you and your co-sponsors on legislation going forward,” Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch told lawmakers.

Joshua Roberts / Reuters file

Facebook stops fighting disclosure rules

Democrats are also pressing the Federal Election Commission to limit foreign influence on U.S. elections by requiring political ads on digital platforms to have the same disclosure requirements as broadcast ads. Facebook has spent years pushing the FEC to exempt it from such disclosure rules, arguing in 2011 that it wasn’t practical to include disclaimers in “small, character-limited ads.” After the recent revelations about Russian influence, Facebook changed its position in a new letter to the FEC, which is now moving toward requiring the disclaimers.

The Klobuchar-Warner bill has elicited criticism from some free-speech advocates, including a former Republican FEC commissioner, who argue that the legislation would have an adverse impact on political speech by ordinary Americans, subjecting small grass-roots groups to burdensome reporting requirements and legal liability.

Policy experts also question how the bill would actually work. Daphne Keller of the Stanford Center for Internet and Society pointed to the challenges of determining whether an ad buyer is a foreign entity, particularly if buyers rely on outside vendors to purchase ads.

“Nobody knows how to figure out who counts as Russian,” she said. “It seems extremely easy to hide your identity.”

But supporters say that the bill’s narrow focus — and the coming 2018 and 2020 elections — could give it a shot at passage.

“Everyone is trying to figure out how to move forward in the future to prevent social media from wrecking democracy and interfering with elections,” says Anupam Chander, a visiting law professor at Georgetown University and a professor at University of California, Davis. “That seems to be the most urgent and, in some sense, doable of the proposals.”

Reluctance to declare Facebook a monopoly

Despite the current political backlash against Facebook and other tech behemoths, it’s unclear how much appetite that Washington legislators and regulators have for more sweeping changes.

In recent months, Democrats have begun embracing an anti-monopoly stance against big tech companies, including Amazon and Google. The Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank chaired by Zephyr Teachout, a Democrat from New York who ran unsuccessfully for governor and the U.S. House, is now calling on federal regulators to turn their attention to Facebook, given the platform’s ubiquity and dominance of the global advertising market.

The institute is calling on the Federal Trade Commission to stop Facebook from making any further acquisitions.

“The system is too big, and can’t be managed,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at Open Markets. “They can’t pay attention to what’s going on various properties they control.”

The desire for the government to intervene because of Facebook’s overwhelming influence on American life has attracted some bipartisan interest. Before he left the Trump administration as the White House’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon reportedly said that he wanted to regulate Google and Facebook like public utilities, given their essential role in everyday life, according to The Intercept.

But even the legislators who are leading the charge on Facebook’s political ads have yet to press for broader regulatory action to rein in the company.

When asked whether Warner considered Facebook to be a monopoly, Cohen, his spokesperson, demurred.

“He is talking to experts in this space on both sides of the debate, to be educated,” she said. “It’s a good question.”

Sarbanes similarly declined to comment on whether the government should regulate Facebook as a public utility. His chief of staff, Jason Gleason, said, “I don’t think we really have anything to add on that front.”

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, has pushed for more aggressive antitrust policies and criticized Amazon’s “growing monopoly” in the wake of its acquisition of Whole Foods. But when asked whether he had similar concerns about Facebook being a monopoly, Khanna, like his colleagues, stressed the need to focus on stronger disclosure laws.

“This will require any social media ads to disclose their funding source. It would help make sure there is transparency,” said Khanna, who supports the Klobuchar-Warner bill and is working on tech disclosure issues.

Khanna pointed out, moreover, that consumers do have a range of options outside of Facebook when it comes to social-media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn. “The key is to make sure there is strong competition and innovation to attract new users and keep them,” he said.

Some consumer rights advocates are also pushing federal lawmakers to strengthen those rights by requiring more information about the vast swaths of data that platforms collect on their users.

“You have to stop the massive flow of the digital DNA of our daily lives that’s flowing into Google and Facebook,” says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group for online consumer protection. “Individuals should be given the right to determine whether political campaigns can access their personal sensitive information.”

Who reads the fine print?

Digital platforms like Facebook typically require end-user agreements that give them permission to share consumers’ data to third parties. But critics says that few consumers have time to read or understand the fine print, and that tech companies themselves don’t always know how advertisers or outside app developers will use the data they’re given.

“Even if you say you accept Facebook advertising practices, you don’t know what’s behind the screen,” Chester said.

“Facebook is free to do almost whatever it wants with your personal information, and has no reason to put safeguards in place,” Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager, wrote in a New York Times op-ed article this week. “Facebook needs to be regulated more tightly, or broken up so that no single entity controls all of its data.”

Such concerns have spurred new digital privacy laws in Europe: Under a new data protection regime that goes into effect next year, the European Union will give consumers broad access to the personal data that’s being collected digitally and be able to impose hefty new penalties on companies for violations.

“You’d be able to know much more quickly who’s buying the ads on your feed and the information they’re using to profile you,” says Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland. “There’s no regulation that forces that in the U.S.”

Facebook insists that it’s already taking steps to strengthen its privacy policies in the U.S., partly in response to existing federal regulations. In 2011, the FTC charged Facebook with deceiving consumers by telling them their information on the site could be kept private, then making it public. Facebook settled with the FTC the next year, agreeing to get users’ express consent before changing privacy settings and to subject the company to independent audits of its privacy practices.

“Facebook is an important part of many people’s lives. That’s an enormous responsibility — and one that we take incredibly seriously,” said Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of global public policy. “It’s why we build tools and provide education that put people in control of their privacy, and why we continually engage with policymakers about the best ways to protect people, create jobs, build community and promote innovation.”

But the U.S. has traditionally taken a very different approach toward consumer privacy rights than Europe has.

“Europe sees privacy as much more about human dignity, while here there is this broad sense that companies themselves have all these rights,” said Pasquale. While the U.S. could follow the E.U.’s lead by giving consumers broad access to their personal data and how it’s being used, that hasn’t been a focus for Washington lawmakers.

Keller, the Stanford law expert, said that European-style privacy requirements might disadvantage smaller tech companies, and “Congress hasn’t signaled that’s the trade-off they want.”

The public spotlight has already prompted Facebook to undertake internal reforms — partly to pre-empt federal regulation, and partly to reassure users who are feeling increasingly anxious about the company’s practices.

In late October, shortly before testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Facebook officials unveiled new changes that would require political advertisers to verify their identity and include new disclosures in election ads. On Wednesday, the company announced a new tool that would let users see if they had engaged with content created by certain Russian propagandists.

“Facebook is already starting to engage in more transparency,” Stoller said. “So the pressure is working.”","university of california davis

"Daniella Silva, The Associated Press",A Baltimore detective was killed with his own gun just one day before he was set to testify before a federal grand jury in a case involving other officers.,2017-11-23T16:23:00Z,nbc-news,Baltimore Detective Sean Suiter killed day before testimony in police corruption case,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/baltimore-detective-sean-suiter-killed-day-testimony-police-corruption-case-n823656,https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_47/2237526/171123-sean-suiter-mc-1539_ae69fa5e694caa9fcb6bc420b4a96a86.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"A Baltimore detective was fatally shot with his own gun just one day before he was set to testify before a federal grand jury in a case involving other officers, the city’s police commissioner said Wednesday.

“Detective Suiter was going to offer federal grand jury testimony about an incident that occurred several years ago that included officers who are now federally indicted back in March,” Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said of Sean Suiter.

“He was scheduled to offer grand jury testimony the day after he was murdered,” he added.

But Davis stressed that as the search for Suiter’s killer continues, there was currently no evidence that the slaying was linked to his upcoming testimony or any conspiracy.

“While I understand the wild possibilities that go through people’s minds when we all want answers, I just am determined to keep following the evidence,” he said. “There’s nothing we won’t consider, there’s no path we won’t go down if the evidence takes us down that path.""

But Davis said the evidence appeared to show that the murder followed a “spontaneous encounter” after Suiter approached a man behaving suspiciously in a vacant lot in between some houses on Nov. 15. He died the following day.

Davis said evidence showed that Suiter’s decision to approach the man was “spontaneous and unplanned” and it was not as if the officer had been lured to any particular location.

The commissioner added that the evidence refutes that Suiter’s partner “was anything but just that — his partner.”

That officer took cover across the street upon hearing the sound of gunfire and then immediately called 911, he said.

There was evidence of a physical struggle between Suiter, 43, and his killer and the detective was shot in the head and killed by his own gun, Davis said.

Suiter was an 18-year-veteran of the force and father of five.

He was due to testify before a federal grand jury investigating a group of Baltimore officers who worked together on a firearms crime task force and have been charged with stealing money, property and narcotics from people over two years, according to The Associated Press.

The members of the Gun Trace Task Force, a small unit tasked with removing illegal guns from Baltimore streets, were described in an indictment as abusing their position to detain people under false pretenses, threaten them and steal from them, according to the AP.

They are also stand accused of faking police reports, lying to investigators and defrauding the department.

Davis emphasized that he had been told both the acting attorney general and the FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Baltimore field office that Suiter was a witness, and “not the target of any ongoing criminal investigation.”

“There is no information that has been communicated to me that Detective Suiter was anything other than a stellar detective, great friend, loving husband and dedicated father,” he said.

A reward of $215,000 is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the person who killed Suiter.","baltimore

""He's a pretty nice guy,"" said lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee, who has been operating and caring for the 24-year-old. Oh has become a focus of worldwide attention after he was badly wounded by fellow North Korean soldiers as he scrambled across the border in the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South on Nov. 13.

Video of Oh's escape released on Wednesday showed him stumbling over the border and being dragged unconscious through the undergrowth by South Korean troops.

Lee has been almost the only person to speak with Oh since he arrived at the hospital, he told Reuters in an interview at his office at Ajou University Hospital, just a few floors away from where the defector lies guarded by South Korean special forces and intelligence officers.

The surgeon, who has hung a South Korean flag in the soldier's room, said he is avoiding subjects that may disturb his patient. Oh is eating his first ""clear liquid"" food such as broths, and can smile, talk, and use his hands, Lee said. But when his patient woke on Sunday he cried out in pain, and Lee said he is still anxious about the South Korean guards.

Lee said Oh told him that he had joined the North Korean army when he was 17, right after secondary school graduation. The soldier's hair is styled ""like a jarhead, like a U.S. Marine, so I actually joked 'why don't you join the South Korean Marines?' He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.""

Medical teams have worked for days to remove the shards of at least four bullets from Oh's body, stitch up his shredded organs, and treat pre-existing conditions including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and a case of massive intestinal worms, Lee said.

""He's a quite strong man,"" said Lee.

Since Oh's defection, North Korea appeared to have replaced all its security guards on the border, an intelligence source in the South told Yonhap news agency on Thursday.

Lee said that when the defector arrived in an American military helicopter at the hospital — which is equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment and is used to treat VIP visitors such as visiting U.S. presidents — he came with zero personal information.

On the flight in, American army flight medics had fought to keep Oh alive, jabbing a large needle into his chest to treat a collapsed lung.

Oh was immediately wheeled into a diagnostic room where doctors confirmed he was suffering from massive internal bleeding. ""We knew then that we didn't have time to hesitate,"" Lee said, standing in that room Thursday night.

Lee Cook-jong, a surgeon at Ajou University Hospital, attends a press conference at the hospital in Suwon, south of Seoul, South Korea, Nov. 22, 2017, to speak about the condition of a North Korean soldier who was shot and wounded by fellow soldiers while defecting to South Korea. YONHAP / EPA

Two major surgeries were required to remove the bullets and patch Oh back together, and the medical team pumped as much as 12 liters of new blood into his body. The normal body has less than half as much blood.

""He told me that he is so thankful for South Koreans for saving his life and giving him that much blood,"" Lee said.

Lee has been playing South Korean pop music and American films and TV shows for his patient, but has not exposed him to any news coverage.

Among the shows, Oh showed a liking for the French-American thriller ""Transporter 3,"" comedy ""Bruce Almighty"" starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman; and the crime-solving TV series ""CSI,"" Lee said.

Most North Korean defectors undergo security questioning by South Korea's intelligence agency once they arrive in the South before being sent to a resettlement center for a three-month education on life in the South. After they are released, central and local governments provide 7 million won ($6,450) in cash over a year, as well as support in housing, education and job training.

Police officers are assigned to each of the defectors to ensure their security and safety.

Even if Oh fully recovers, some scars will stay for the rest of his life, the surgeon said.

Among the longest lasting wounds will be the damage to his colon, which was shredded by a bullet and had to be stitched back together in seven places. ""It's a lifelong complication for the patient, so he's better to be very cautious in his diet,"" said the surgeon.

Besides the potential for further medical complications, Lee says he is most worried about making sure Oh recovers psychologically. The soldier has already told him he had a nightmare about being returned to the North.

The surgeon said he has asked senior South Korean military officials who are eager to question the soldier to hold off while he recovers.

""This North Korean guy is not going anywhere,"" Lee said. ""He is staying in South Korea. So we don't need to be hasty.""","crimesolving tv series csi lee

A routine traffic stop had devolved into a crisis.

""I was shaking,"" Ziegler said.

Police had pulled their car over for running a stoplight, shortly after leaving the parking lot of a shopping center, where the family had spent the day. After checking her identification, officers told Ziegler's 22-year-old daughter, Chelsey Marshall, that she was under arrest for an outstanding warrant tied to unpaid traffic tickets.

Ziegler held a cell phone up to Marshall's face. Her attorney was on the line.

""Please help,"" she said. ""I don't know what to do.""

The arrest shouldn't have happened. Days before, Marshall had received community service after settling the tickets — one for driving without a license, the other for not having insurance.

But Marshall, then late in a high-risk pregnancy, was taken to jail anyway. Her bail was set at $661.

Pending a miracle, Marshall would have to spend the long holiday weekend behind bars.

""My heart just sank,"" Ziegler said. ""I was like, 'Oh, there's no way I can come up with this right now.'""

On any given night, more than 450,000 Americans are locked up in jails, charged but not convicted of crimes. Though the nation's cash bail system is intended to guarantee that defendants will show up for their court dates, critics say it works less as an incentive and more as a punishment inflicted disproportionately on communities of color and low-income defendants.

Embed The Great Bail-Out: Reform project looks to free thousands 4:15 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

Last week, criminal justice reformers backed by $30 million in donations from the wealthy and influential announced the launch of The Bail Project — a bold effort to disrupt the bail system by using charitable dollars to bail people like Marshall out of jail. Over the next five years the nonprofit's bail 'disrupters' plan to use a revolving fund to post bail for over 160,000 low-income, pretrial defendants.

Robin Steinberg, The Bail Project's founder and a veteran public defender, said that the way bail is commonly applied in courts both large and small has created a two-tiered, cash-register system of justice. Those who can afford to pay get out of jail, while the poor languish behind bars.

""You haven't been convicted of a crime, you are supposed to be presumed innocent,"" Steinberg said. ""And the only way to get out of a jail cell when bail is set is to buy your way out. That disadvantages poor people and it disadvantages people of color.""

""If you're rich, you buy your freedom and you buy the presumption of innocence,"" she added. ""If you are not rich you can't buy your freedom and you don't get the presumption of innocence.""

Starting in January, The Bail Project will open offices in Tulsa and St. Louis, Missouri, and eventually expand to 40 other sites. In addition to paying bail, Project employees will work with clients over time to support them through their cases, increasing the likelihood they will return for their court dates by reminding them of their court schedule or connecting them to needed services, such as transportation or childcare. When the case is over, the bail money is returned to the fund.

""That means we can use that same dollar to bail out somebody else's son and somebody else's mother and somebody else's child, over and over and over again,"" Steinberg said.

Like a snowball rolling downhill, the consequences of remaining incarcerated, even for a day, can quickly compound. Pretrial defendants who can't afford bail risk losing jobs, housing, relationships, even custody of children. In the most tragic cases, being stuck in jail can destroy a life.

Last year, 26-year-old Jeffrey Pendleton died in a New Hampshire jail after being charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. He could not afford to post $100 bail. In 2015, Kalief Browder, 22, committed suicide after spending three years at New York City's Rikers Island, including long stints in solitary confinement, while awaiting trial for stealing a backpack when he was 16. He could not initially afford his bail, set at $3,000.

Those consequences fall disproportionately on communities of color, said Vincent Southerland, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality and the Law at NYU Law, and a member of The Bail Project's board.

""The domino effect on those lives is that you're cut off from employment, cut off from opportunities to reunite with your family, cut off from the community at large,"" Southerland said. ""And it really puts a pause on your life if you're sitting in jail waiting for your criminal case to be resolved.""

According to a report by the Pretrial Justice Institute, taxpayers spend about $14 billion a year on costs stemming from pre-trial detention. The Bail Project expects to save taxpayers and municipalities more than half a billion dollars a year.

That return on investment, Steinberg said, helped convince prominent foundations, including Virgin Atlantic CEO Richard Branson's charity, and billionaires like Mike Novogratz to back the fund.

But Novogratz, a prominent hedge fund manager, said it wasn't dollars and cents that drove him. It was the outrage he felt after observing firsthand the sometimes Kafka-esque machinations of the criminal justice system.

""I think it's a revolutionary-in-spirit idea,"" Novogratz said. ""In some ways, it's a middle finger to the system, saying, 'Hey, you know what? The system is so broke we're just going to show up and pay the damn bail.'""

The 'disrupters'

While the initiative is national in scope, it was born in the South Bronx.

Ten years ago Steinberg, then a public defender working in the Bronx Criminal Court, grew so frustrated by the thousands of people languishing behind bars because they couldn't afford bail that she and colleague David Feige launched The Bronx Freedom Fund. The fund provided the blueprint Steinberg and her partners used to go national.

New York City has made several reforms to its bail system, including launching its own citywide bail fund. But in the Bronx, Freedom Fund employees remain besieged by calls from families and loved ones of defendants who can't afford bail. The Bronx Criminal Court is one of the most backlogged in the country, a place where misdemeanor cases — even for minor charges like riding a bike on a sidewalk or jumping a turnstile — can stretch on for months. More often than not, defendants must wait hours to see a judge, only to have their cases postponed, over and over again.

According to court data, in early 2016 there were more than 2,300 misdemeanor cases in the Bronx that had been pending for over a year. Misdemeanor defendants who wish to exercise their right to trial wait an average 827 days for a jury trial. Black, Latino and other people of color make up 95 percent of all misdemeanor arraignments in the Bronx.

If they don't end up in the notoriously violent central New York City jail on Rikers Island, those defendants are often sent to the world's largest floating jail, the Vernon C. Bain Center on the East River. The lock-up, which sticks to the Bronx shoreline like a barnacle, is known to both attorneys and defendants as ""the Boat.""

Several times a week, the Freedom Fund's ""bail disrupters"" travel to the Boat to bail out their clients, sometimes for amounts as low as $250. Past a trash processing plant and a fish market, down a long drive topped with concertina wire, is the bail office. After sliding money through a rusted slot at the window, the mostly African-American and Latino citizens who come to pay bail for their loved ones must sometimes wait for hours as paperwork is faxed back and forth between offices.

Novogratz traveled with a disrupter to the Boat, where the average daily population of male inmates hovers near 800. Around 2 p.m., after Novogratz and the disrupter paid bail for two men, he was shocked to find that they wouldn't be able to get out of jail until 11 p.m.

Upon release, he said, they'd be given a city transit Metrocard and would have to walk to the nearest bus stop, only to come back the next morning to pick up their belongings.

""Every step of the way that day, you realized that there's a system that was just kicking everybody in the knees,"" Novogratz said. ""There was absolutely no dignity built into the system. And all these people were arrested, not even convicted.""

""The presumption of innocence that we cherish in this country doesn't exist if you don't have the money,"" he added. ""And that seems outrageous.""

A 35-minute bus ride west of the Boat is the Freedom Fund's office at the Bronx Criminal Court, where bail disrupters scroll through an ever-growing spreadsheet of potential clients, and send text messages or make calls to clients, their relatives, social workers, or significant others to remind them of court dates.

That kind of support, said Ezra Ritchin, project director for the Freedom Fund, has helped 95 percent of its clients return for their court dates.

""They get a text message or a call the week before saying like, 'Hey, remember to find child care next week during your court date because it might last eight hours, even though you only see the judge for 20 seconds,'"" Ritchin said. ""'Remember to call your job and ask for the day off.' That's the kind of support people need. They don't need to be locked up in order to make it to a court date.""

Unaffordable bail can convince defendants their best chance of getting out of jail is to take a plea deal. Stripping away that coercive mechanism, Ritchin said, allows them to fight the charges — interrupting the cycle of guilty pleas sought by prosecutors looking for high conviction rates. There's evidence that making bail translates into weak cases getting thrown out; in the Bronx, prosecutors have dismissed over 50 percent of cases of handled by the Freedom Fund.

""If you're held [pending] bail and you come to court, the prosecutor will offer you a plea deal and say, ""If you plead guilty, you get to go home today,""' Ritchin said. ""If you maintain your innocence, you have to go back to jail and wait for your next court date….If you do take the prosecutor's offer, you're able to go home. But that criminal record will follow you for the rest of your life.""

""Our clients don't have to make that decision,"" he added. ""They don't have to plead guilty.""

'They need to be home'

Although the Bail Project has not officially launched yet in Tulsa, it has already made a difference in the life of Chelsey Marshall and her mother, Tommi Ziegler.

While Marshall waited in a holding cell, attorney Ruth Hamilton, who had helped Marshall clear up her warrant days before, made a series of desperate but fruitless calls to the police. Ziegler was frantic about her pregnant daughter spending the weekend in jail.

""I asked [Ziegler] if there was anywhere that she could go to get the money or if there was anything she could do,"" Hamilton said. ""She just said no. You could tell how hard that was for her to not be able to pay for her daughter to get out of jail, and to know that the court was going to be closed on Monday.""

""It just felt so unjust for someone to be in jail for three days when they never should have been arrested,"" she added. ""I just thought that maybe there was something that somebody could do.""

That somebody was Steinberg. She contacted a donor in New York City, who offered to front the bail. Marshall was released.

""It was a blessing,"" Ziegler said. ""You don't know how much it impacts a person's life. When they don't have the money, but they need to be home.""","virgin atlantic ceo richard bransons charity

Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said the search will continue until there is full certainty about the fate of the ARA San Juan. He said evidence showed “an anomalous event that was singular, short, violent and non-nuclear that was consistent with an explosion.”

“According to this report, there was an explosion,” Balbi told reporters. “We don’t know what caused an explosion of these characteristics at this site on this date.”

U.S. and specialist agencies said the “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was produced just hours after the navy lost contact with the submarine on Nov. 15.

The sub was originally scheduled to arrive Monday at the Mar del Plata Navy Base, about 250 miles southeast of Buenos Aires. Relatives of the crew who have gathered at the base to receive psychological counseling broke into tears and hugged each other after they received the news. Some clung to a fence crowded with blue-and-white Argentine flags, rosary beads and messages of support. Some declined to speak, while others lashed out in anger at the navy’s response.

“They sent a piece of crap to sail,” said Itati Leguizamon, wife of submarine crew member German Suarez. “They inaugurated a submarine with a coat of paint and a flag in 2014, but without any equipment inside. The navy is to blame for its 15 years of abandonment.”

The German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in 1985 and was most recently refit in 2014.

During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts say that refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers and even the smallest mistake during the cutting phase of the operation can put the safety of the ship and the crew at risk.

The Argentine navy and outside experts have said that even if the ARA San Juan is intact, its crew might have only enough oxygen to be submerged seven to 10 days.

Authorities said late Wednesday that Argentine navy ships as well a U.S. P-8 Poseidon aircraft and a Brazilian air force plane would return to the area to check out the abnormal sound, which originated about 30 miles north of the submarine’s last registered position.

The search location straddles the edge of the continental shelf, with widely varying ocean depths, some as great as 10,000 feet. Experts say the submarine could not have supported pressures that far down.

“If a submarine goes below its crush-depth, it would implode, it would just collapse,” said James H. Patton Jr. a retired Navy captain.

“It would sound like a very, very big explosion to any listening device.”

Whatever it was, U.S. Navy Lt. Lily Hinz said the sound detected “was not a whale, and it is not a regularly occurring sound.”

The San Juan lost contact as it was sailing from the extreme southern port of Ushuaia. The submarine’s captain had reported a battery failure.

More than a dozen airplanes and ships have been participating in the multinational search despite stormy weather that has caused waves of more than 20 feet. Search teams are combing an area of some 185,000 square miles, which is roughly the size of Spain.

The U.S. government has sent two P-8 Poseidons, a naval research ship, a submarine rescue chamber and sonar-equipped underwater vehicles. U.S. Navy sailors from the San Diego-based Undersea Rescue Command are also helping with the search.

Britain’s Ministry of Defense sent a special airplane with emergency life support pods to join the hunt that includes planes and ships from a dozen nations.

Hopes were buoyed after brief satellite calls were received and when sounds were detected deep in the South Atlantic. But experts later determined that neither was from the missing sub.

“They haven’t come back and they will never come back,” said Jesica Gopar, wife of submarine officer Fernando Santilli, choking back tears. “I had a bad feeling about this and now it has been confirmed.”","mar de plata naval base after argentinas navy

The president lambasted his predecessor’s administration for not ""really winning"" against ISIS, claiming Americans were finally beginning to hear good news out of the nation's overseas fight against terror.

""Everybody is talking about the progress you've made in Afghanistan since I opened it up, and you've turned it around in the last three-to-five months like nobody has seen,"" Trump said, speaking with the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division via satellite. ""They say we've made more progress against ISIS than they did in years with the previous administration, and that's because I'm letting you perform your job.""

Reuters

Trump continued attacking former President Barack Obama's administration throughout the teleconference, seated behind a desk at Mar-a-Lago, his membership-only resort in West Palm, Florida. The president was spending his 100th day visiting a Trump-property since assuming the Oval Office when he spoke with service members on Thursday in a discussion that ranged from political banter to stock market analysis.

""With armed forces, we're really winning. We know how to win, but we have to let you win. You weren't winning before,"" the president said. ""They were letting you play even. We want to let you win.""

U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have declined by nearly 50 percent as reports indicate the terror group has seen much of its territorial holdings depleted throughout 2016 and 2017.

The encouraging trend of a global decline in terror started well before the Trump administration, however. Terrorist attacks decreased for the second year in a row in 2016, the State Department stated in a report released earlier this year, with the majority of attacks occurring in Iraq, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and the Philippines.

Meanwhile, as Newsweek previously reported, more innocent civilians have been killed in the fight against ISIS during 10 months of Trump administration than in Obama’s three years of overseeing the effort.

Still, Trump touted his leadership when speaking with the military on Thursday. He claimed the media was finally reacting positively to the continued fight against terror.

""We're very very proud of you,"" the president said. ""Everybody in this country is watching and they are seeing positive reports for a change. Instead of the neutral and negative reports.""","iraq afghanistan india pakistan

He and the first family will have plenty of palate-tickling choices at Mar-a-Lago, their ornate mansion in Palm Beach.

""The first family will spend the evening enjoying Thanksgiving dinner with friends and family at the winter White House,"" according to a midday pool report.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

""The menu includes all the traditional fare—turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes [with] marshmallows, a variety of baked goods, local produce and cheeses, red snapper and Florida stone crab. Dessert includes various cakes and pies.""

Last year, the celebratory selection went far beyond the traditional turkey, according to The Hill, which offered a rundown of the sweet and savory options to be laid before the notoriously picky then–president elect.

For the appetizer course, the Trumps enjoyed ""a seafood display with large crabs, oysters on the half shell, jumbo shrimp and middle neck clams,"" the site reported. If that didn't entice, there was ""Mr. Trump's Wedge Salad,"" ahi tuna ""martinis,"" couscous salad and deviled eggs. Soups on for the holiday: lobster bisque and vegetable minestrone.

A woman who answered the phone at the membership-only ""Winter White House"" Thursday said she couldn't gabble about the Thanksgiving gobble. The White House traveling press put in a morning request for the day's menu, per a pool report. The first family will enjoy their meal after the president holds a teleconference with U.S. troops around the world and makes a holiday visit to Coast Guard Station Lake Worth Inlet.

Last year, Mar-a-Lago's main course naturally included the classic ""oven-roasted turkey with stuffing and mashed potatoes and gravy."" Other entrées suggested a bit of an international flair, including a ""leg of lamb with grilled pita and tzatziki sauce"" and ""pan-seared Chilean sea bass with curried vegetables and coconut shellfish broth,"" per The Hill.

Seafood lovers could tuck into ""grilled diver scallops with roasted vegetable ratatouille,"" while meat-and-potatoes types could pick ""herb marinated beef tenderloin with steamed vegetables, whipped potatoes, warm popovers and horseradish cream"" or go for the ""red wine braised short ribs with potatoes and braising jus.""

The president reportedly enjoys a double serving of ice cream for dessert after his meals. Last year's dessert course tempted diners with traditional pumpkin pie along with pecan and key lime varieties.

There was also a toasted coconut cake and a three-layer ""Trump chocolate cake,"" the latter perhaps akin to the morsel the president raved about in April while relating how he informed China's president, Xi Jingpin, that the U.S. had launched a missile strike on Syria.

Not listed: well-done steak with ketchup—but it's reasonable to guess that being both president and owner of the estate, Trump could put in a special request to the kitchen if he wished.

Trump's trip to Mar-a-Lago, where he's hosted Xi and other heads of state, marks his first return to the Florida manse since this spring. The president, of course, has spent ample time at his other properties, with the Mar-a-Lago jaunt marking the 100th day he's been at one of his resorts and clubs since taking over the Oval Office.","coast guard station lake

It was a rare and dramatic defection, an intelligence source told South Korean news agency Yonhap.

According to the source, the border guards may have been punished for their failure in stopping the defection.

""Signs were detected that North Korea has replaced all border security officials following the defection. Given this situation, commanders of the responsible military unit and senior officers might have undergone punishment,"" the source was quoted as saying in an article published Thursday.

It would not be unprecedented for the North Korean regime, led by Kim Jong Un, to punish border guards for failing to prevent defections. According to the human rights organization Amnesty International, a commander and a vice commander of a border post near China were arrested and sentenced to death in 2007 following an official investigation into North Korean defectors, many of whom flee the country over the Chinese border.

Earlier this week, the South Korean intelligence agency told lawmakers about rare punitive actions taken against top North Korean officials following an inspection of the military’s hugely influential General Political Bureau, an organ devoted to ensuring adherence to the ruling party line among the Korean People’s Army ranks, reportedly due to their “impure attitude.”

The punishment was initially seen as a possible sign of infighting among Kim’s key aides, but it could also be related to the border guards (carefully handpicked for their ideological commitment to the regime) and their inability to prevent the defection.

United Nations Command/Handout/via Reuters

An edited video of the area’s CCTV footage the United Nations Command released on Wednesday showed a group of border guards wearing bulletproof vests and armed with pistols and AK-47s chasing after the soldier.

They fired at least 40 rounds at the soldier, who had exited the jeep he drove past a checkpoint after it appeared to get stuck in a ditch. He then ran across the border line. One of the North Korean guards appears to cross South Korea's border, violating the terms of the 1953 Korean War armistice.

The 24-year-old soldier, identified by his surname, Oh, in a Wednesday press conference, suffered gunshot wounds to his abdomen and chest area and collapsed on a pile of dead leaves, just after crossing into South Korea.

The three South Korean soldiers—1st class sergeants Noh Yeong Soo and Song Seoung Hyeon, and deputy commander lieutenant colonel Kwon Young Hwan—crawled to his rescue. They were among six servicemen who contributed to saving the defector's life. The other three were American soldiers: sergeant Robert Hartfield, major Jeffery Schmidt and lieutenant colonel Matthew Farmer. All six were awarded a medal on Thursday.

“In recognition for their efforts in rescuing a North Korean defector, Nov.13, General Vincent K. Brooks, United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea commander, awarded Joint Security Area soldiers the Army Commendation medal,” a post shared on the U.S. Forces Korea Facebook page read.

This story was updated to clarify the date when two North Korean officers near a Chinese border post were arrested and sentenced to death. It was 2007, not 2017.","united nations commandhandoutvia reuters

“The economic ability to increase the production of defense products and services quickly is a vital element of military security,” Putin told military leaders and senior officials in the defense industrial complex on Wednesday. “All strategic and simply large companies, regardless of the type of ownership, must be able to do this.”

The Russian president raised the issue after listing the country’s successes in raising combat readiness for a hypothetical war scenario. Putin singled out Russia’s large Zapad 2017 exercise with Belarus in September, during which units across Russia practiced for a threat akin to an attack by Western nations.

Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin/Reuters

Putin praised the efficiency of troops and reservists that took part, as well as the transportation infrastructure used, according to the Kremlin’s video recording of the meeting.

“We need to review once again the defense companies’ ability to quickly increase output,” Putin said, reading out a prepared statement for the meeting. “The exercise has exposed certain shortcomings. We must analyze them so as to propose additional measures to enhance mobilization readiness.”

The Russian leader provided no figures and set no targets for defense companies but asked officials to draw up output recommendations for the industry giants.

While Russia has repeatedly dismissed fears that it seeks to start a war with NATO, insisting its broad Western-heavy reinforcement is defensive, the Kremlin’s dubious interpretation of events on the ground in Ukraine and Syria have damaged Western trust in Moscow’s statements.

Since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014—a military operation it initially denied—it has inconsistently pleaded innocence over causing or interfering the ongoing conflict raging in the eastern Donbass region of its southern neighbor. Western support for Ukraine’s decision to pursue integration with the European Union, as opposed to entangle itself in more deals with Russia, has eroded Moscow’s relationship with the U.S. and much of Europe.

In a bid to showcase strength at a time of political strife, Russia has increased military activity and drills, as well as reforming military units along its western borders.","sputnikmikhail klimentyevkremlinreuters putin

In an interview with Israeli news channel i24 this week, the minister tackled issues that have increased tensions between the U.S. Jewish population and Israel, including the government’s policies on Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and free prayer at the Western Wall, according to website Arutz Sheva.

“Most of the Jews don’t have children serving as soldiers, going to the Marines, going to Afghanistan or to Iraq,” Hotovely, who is a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing party, Likud, told the TV channel. “They don’t know how it feels to be attacked by rockets, and I think part of it is actually experiencing what Israel is dealing with on a daily basis.”

In the interview, she also mentioned that U.S. Jews don’t visit the Western Wall, which is currently at the center of a controversy between Israel and Jews around the world over the creation of a non-Orthodox prayer site. “The reason it’s empty, if you ask me, is not that they don’t like the arrangement,"" she said. ""The reason it’s empty is because most of the time people are not even interested [in going] to the Kotel.""

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun

Israel has often criticized Jews living in the U.S. over their right to advise, but Hotovely’s comments, implying that they lack commitment to their homeland, reinforces a thought U.S. Jewish organizations have tried to fight for a long time, Reuters reported.

Hotovely’s comments earned a condemnation from Netanyahu. “There is no room for such attacks and these comments do not represent Israel’s position,” he said. “Diaspora Jews are dear to us and an inseparable part of our people.”

Hotovely responded to the outcry, adding that she was trying to explain the “complexity of life in Israel under the threat of constant terror,” the news site Haaretz reported. She recognized, however, the contributions U.S. Jewry makes to Israel.

It’s not the first time Hotovely has made incendiary comments. Earlier this month, Princeton University Hillel withdrew an invitation to her because of past comments regarding Israeli Arabs. In response to the university's decision, she said: ""The fact [that] you are inviting an overseas representative of the Israeli government and you are cancelling on the same day because some students don’t like my opinions, this is something really bad that’s happening under what I call the liberal dictatorship.” She later issued an apology.

At least 200,000 U.S. Jews live in Israel and a considerable number of young people serve in the military, Haaretz reported.","kotel reutersronen zvulun israel

The operation, which took place in February 2017, involved commandos infiltrating an area under the control of the Islamic State militant group (ISIS), to place a surveilance device. The intelligence obtained through the device prompted a short-term ban on laptops on flights from several majority-Muslim countries to the US and the UK.

The target of the operation, according to a Vanity Fair report published on Wednesday, was an ISIS cell attempting to recreate a weapon developed by a top Al-Qaeda bombmaker. The weapon consisted of an explosive device that could be concealed inside a laptop and smuggled past airport security checks, raising the spectre of high-casualty attacks against civilian airlines.

Trump’s disclosure at the May 10 meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russia's then-ambassador to Washington Sergei Kislyak has been widely publicised at the time, but details of the operation itself have not previously been disclosed. In particular, Trump is alleged to have revealed the name of the city where the operation took place, leading to fears that the source who alerted the Israelis to ISIS's intentions may be compromised.

The president's carelessness with sensitive information threatened to deal a blow to the historically close relationship between American and Israeli intelligence agencies. Altough Israel enjoys a relatively robust relationship with Russia, Moscow is also a key ally of the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad - a historical enemy of Israel - and of Iran, widely seen as Israel's main regional rival.

“If this report is true, then giving those details about operations is something that is exclusively out of the question,” says Major (res.) Aviv Oreg, former head of the Al-Qaeda and global jihad desk for Israel's Military Intelligence, told Newsweek over the phone. “I’m sure Israel will have second thoughts about giving information.”

“This is like something that has never been seen before,” he said. “You delivered to a third party all the details of how the secret service operates in Israel, how they are operating in the field in Syria. This is totally unacceptable.”

Despite the discomfort about the leak, the majority of former and current Israeli officials approached by Newsweek refrained from openly criticizing an American president viewed as one of the most vocal supporters of Israel to occupy the White House in many years.

""You assume that everything that was published was the truth? I'm not so sure. The relationship is still very strong,"" said one former military attaché at the Embassy of Israel in Washington, who has also served as the director of Israel's Counter Terrorism Bureau.

Maj. Gen. (ret.) Yaakov Amidror, former head of Israel's National Security Council and National Security Advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is of a similar view.

“Those who are outraged, they don’t know the history, they should know that from time to time things are leaked from the American side, things are leaked from the Israeli side,” he says over the phone.

“We have to learn the lessons,” he said. “We are going on. It will not stop our cooperation with the Americans.”

Israeli and American agencies have long worked in each the other’s favor. They routinely share raw intelligence - such as eavesdropping recordings - and have conducted high-profile operations together, including the 2008 assassination of Imad Mughniyah, the intelligence chief for Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese Islamist group.

In the grand scheme of things, Trump’s bluster may be a blight on the relationship, but not one that can bring it all toppling down. The president himself is viewed in Israel as a friend who will support the country against both the Palestinians and against hostile regional actors, like Hezbollah and Iran - the latter a particularly frequent target of the American president's most combative remarks. Trump also appointed outspokenly pro-Israeli figures to oversee American policy for the region, including his son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner, special advisor Jason Greenblatt and David Friedman, the new ambassador to Israel.

More recently, Trump's administration shuttered the Palestinians Authority’s representative office in Washington D.C. in a bid to stop the Palestinian Authority from taking Israeli officials to the International Criminal Court (ICC) Gaza conflict in 2014. It also shrugged off the construction of the first new Israeli settlements in the West Bank in two decades, and the passing of an Israeli law that legalizes outposts built illegally on private Palestinian land.

Against this backdrop, even intelligence leaks, if kept to a minimum, might just be palatable for Israeli officials. There is one word that Amidror uses to summarize Trump’s disclosure of the top-secret mission and one that captures at least the official Israeli mood: “proportion,” he says.

“It’s not as bad as it was described.”","international criminal court icc gaza

The killings happened in the eastern province of Nangarhar, where ISIS has grown in influence and jostled with the country’s largest militant group, the Taliban.

Attaullah Khogyani, the provincial governor's spokesman, told Reuters that the killings took place in the Surkh Ab bazaar of Achin district.

ISIS made no official claim to have killed its own members, and Afghan authorities provided no additional details about the ISIS beheading of its own fighters, or the context of the incident.

It has been reported previously that ISIS has executed its own fighters in territory under its control, in parts of eastern Syria and northern Iraq, largely after they tried to escape or were accused of working with enemy forces.

The group, which continues to suffer battlefield defeats in Iraq and Syria, has started to grow in Afghanistan, capitalizing on the lawless nature of a country wracked by years of conflict following the 2001 invasion by U.S. and Western forces seeking to overthrow the Taliban.

It has formed an affiliate known as Khorasan Province, which refers to an ancient province that dissected the modern Afghan-Pakistan border. The U.S. is targeting the group in airstrikes, but the majority of those are targeting the Taliban.

President Donald Trump's administration is accelerating its airstrike campaign in Afghanistan as part of his new strategy of expansion in the country. The U.S. military has almost tripled the amount of bombs it has dropped in the country this year compared to the previous year: As of October 31, the air force had deployed 3,554 bombs against the Taliban, which is almost three times the 1,337 it dropped in 2016, and nearly four times the 2015 total of 914.

Trump has also given the military authority to target Taliban drug labs in Afghanistan. The Pentagon believes the Taliban makes more than $200 million annually from opium production, cultivating poppies in the central Asian country to drive revenue for its insurgency against the Afghan government.

On the same day as the beheading, a suicide bomber killed eight people in Jalalabad. They were part of a gathering calling for the reinstatement of a sacked police commander. No group has claimed responsibility.","taliban attaullah khogyani

In the past few hundred years, it has spread across the world and onto the tables of thousands of Americans at Thanksgiving, becoming a crucial component to the annual feast.

Despite its apparent simplicity, there are hundreds of ways to cook the root vegetable. The dishes are sometimes contested, though, as recipes topped with marshmallows are particular to the South, but on the West coast, mashed sweet potatoes are preferred. Sweet potato fries became popular when regular fries were thought to be less healthy—though the healthiness of either variety likely has less to do with the vegetable and more to do with how you cook them.

There are casseroles, frittatas, fries, cobblers, pies, chilies, and roasted or baked sweet potatoes. You can make them savory or whip up a dessert. They can be a part of your appetizer or the main course. The options are truly endless.

But to cook sweet potatoes as close to how your grandmother makes them, these are a few of the classics:

Baked Sweet Potato Fries

From the New York Times’ Mark Bittman, this sweet potato recipe can be made in 35 minutes. Sprinkle some seasoning, bake for 15 minutes, and choose your favorite dipping sauce. The Times says you won’t miss the grease from baking the fries, and two pounds of peeled sweet potatoes will make four to six servings. Don’t forget to flip the fries halfway through so that both sides are crispy.

Classic Sweet Potato Casserole

This classic sweet potato casserole has three options for toppings: marshmallow topping, pecan topping, or a mixture. In under an hour, Diana Rattray of The Spruce says you can whip together this casserole with eight servings. Rattray offers up an option to prepare the dish ahead of time, cover and refrigerate, and take out the next day 30 minutes before popping it in the oven.

Mashed Sweet Potatoes

Sweet potato dishes are typically simple, but this one likely tops the list. Lindsay Funston of Delish rated the mashed sweet potatoes recipe as easy. After 20 to 30 minutes of boiling the potatoes, you can mash just a handful of ingredients into the potatoes to make a side that has the perfect balance of sweet and savory.

Sweet Potato Cobbler

Michael Piazza from Saveur recommends making this Alabama-inspired recipe with an extra crust while baking the cobbler. That way, when one gets eaten, it’s easier to make a second cobbler. Be warned: cobblers are a bit more complex. Dough strips line the sides of the pan to create the crust, which is a bit more complex than a store-bought graham cracker crust you might buy for a pumpkin pie recipe. After baking, sprinkle the cobbler with sugar and cinnamon.

Sweet Potato Kale Frittata

Okay, this one might not be one your grandmother has made, but frittatas could be a unique addition to your Thanksgiving meal. The savory recipe includes eggs, kale, red onion, and goat cheese, in addition to the sweet potatoes. Total time from Marian Cooper Cairns’ Country Living recipe is expected to be just half an hour. The difficulty level is moderate, according to Cairns. If you don’t fancy non-traditional Thanksgiving sides, this could be a great option for breakfast the day after Thanksgiving with your leftover sweet potatoes.","lindsay funston

Turkey time is approaching. Yes, you can cook at home — traditional, wholesome — but the best part of living in New York City is that there are plenty of places to go out for a meal, or even just to pick up some sides.

CBS wasted little time dealing with Charlie Rose, firing the CBS This Morning co-anchor Tuesday less than 24 hours after the Washington Post published its report detailing allegations of sexual harassment and assault by Rose. But the Eye network now has another problem: How to fill the gap left by Rose’s sudden departure. While This Morning is hardly a ratings juggernaut — it’s a perennial third-place finisher in the Nielsen ratings — the current incarnation of the program has actually become something of a success story for CBS. Since Rose, Gayle King, and Norah O’Donnell teamed up in 2012, This Morning has seen the gap separating it from NBC’s second-place Today shrink from a yawning 3 million viewers to a much more modest 647,000 viewers at the end of last season. It’s the closest a CBS morning show has been to NBC or ABC in at least 30 years. Not surprisingly, CBS News chief David Rhodes and other Eye execs aren’t talking yet about their plans for life after Rose. But that doesn’t mean it’s too soon to start thinking about what options the network might have. Based on discussions with a couple of TV industry insiders, as well as our own instincts, here are three of the most likely paths CBS might take.

Look to the CBS digital farm team.

Streaming-only news service CBSN has taken on an increasingly important role within CBS in recent months as the network leans into its digital future (see also: CBS All Access). Over the summer, a newsmagazine featuring CBSN reporters aired as part of the Eye’s prime-time lineup, while last year, CBSN anchor Elaine Quijano was tapped to moderate the vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine. It would thus be quite logical for Rhodes to pluck someone from CBSN to fill Rose’s spot. Not only would it underscore how seriously CBS takes CBSN, it could also serve as a great promotion for the digital network. A CBSN anchor or reporter who took over from Rose could also easily continue to pop up on CBSN, perhaps even anchoring a third hour of This Morning exclusively on CBSN.

Quijano is one obvious CBSN contender for Rose’s gig (though she got mixed reviews for her performance as debate moderator.) Another rising star at CBSN who might work on This Morning is Vlad Duthiers, a Peabody- and Emmy-award-winning reporter known for his coverage of the Ferguson Black Lives Matter protests and the 2010 Haiti earthquake and humanitarian disaster. And while he’s young (under 50), he has a decent amount of international and domestic reporting experience under his belt. The same goes for CBSN’s Reena Ninan, who has similar overseas reporting chops as well as morning-show experience (she co-anchored ABC’s World News Now for a bit before coming to CBS last year). It’s also possible, of course, that CBS could go with another one of its anchors or correspondents not particularly tied to CBSN. But if recent history is any clue, Rhodes and his boss, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves, will try to find Rose’s replacement from inside the network.

Go for a big name.

One way to close that shrinking gap separating This Morning from second-place Today would be to shell out big bucks for a journalism superstar. Someone with a significant fan base could recruit new viewers to the CBS breakfast show, justifying the extra salary such a ploy would require. One name buzzing around Twitter this week has been that of NPR’s Terry Gross, a master interviewer with a rabid fan base among NPR listeners who also fits the Rose mold (serious journalist, respected among elites). It’s the longest of shots, but Rhodes could ask King to convince best friend (and 60 Minutes special correspondent) Oprah Winfrey to get up early and join This Morning. (Reality check: This isn’t going to happen, but wild speculation can be fun.) CNN’s Anderson Cooper technically isn’t available, having signed a new deal with his the all-news network last year. But with Cooper already doing 60 Minutes stories, perhaps something could be worked out between CBS and CNN. (Or maybe CNN wouldn’t be too sad to see Cooper leave prime time: His two-hour nightly show finishes a third in viewers and the key news demo, losing to both Fox News and MSNBC.) Other possibilities: Diane Sawyer, Bryant Gumbel, and Bob Costas.

Still, the star strategy seems unlikely. CBS, which once paid tens of millions to grab Katie Couric away from NBC News, has largely withdrawn from the TV news talent wars. Yes, it did coax Jane Pauley out of TV semi-retirement to take over Sunday Morning. But most of its recent vacancies have been filled from within. Jeff Glor, the incoming anchor of The CBS Evening News, is hardly a household name. And outside of Washington beltway circles, John Dickerson was pretty much unknown before taking over Face the Nation. CBS these days seems inclined to look inside its own house for most vacancies rather than risk significant money on big “personality.” Of course, if an interesting name suddenly becomes available, CBS execs would almost certainly consider making a play. But it’s more likely that whoever replaces Rose will not be very famous.

Do nothing.

The main reason CBS hired Rose to co-anchor the mornings was to draw new attention to what had long been the network’s most troubled time period. For decades, nothing Eye execs did — and they tried just about everything, including turning the show over to the entertainment division and bringing in a studio audience — had much success. Hiring Rose was not a bid to bring in some big TV superstar — think Katie Couric or Anderson Cooper — with a massive fan base. Instead, it was a move meant to signal to audiences that CBS was serious about bringing hard news back to mornings, that folks who listened to NPR and, yes, watched Rose’s show on PBS, would have a place to go as NBC and ABC’s morning shows continued their rush to see which could offer the least amount of substance. It worked: As noted earlier, This Morning is in its best competitive position in decades.

But while Rose’s interviewing skills and awkward charms were obviously part of the mix that helped the show hit its stride, he was hardly some sort of heroic savior without whom This Morning will collapse. What’s more, NBC’s Today has long thrived with just two anchors, while ABC’s Good Morning America had two chief anchors before Michael Strahan came onboard full-time last year. Letting O’Donnell and King handle the show themselves would also save money, no small thing in an age of ever-shrinking network bottom lines. Oh, and it would send a perhaps not-subtle message: Two women can do just fine anchoring a morning show themselves.","diane sawyer bryant gumbel

Here are some of the best deals we’ve found so far on gadgets, gizmos, and everything in between — and if we’re linking to it, it’s on sale now.

Cheaper Grabs

Anker PowerLine Lightning Cable (Ten Feet) This thing is comically long and virtually indestructible. At only $10, it makes the perfect stocking stuffer. Buy Anker PowerLine Lightning Cable (10 feet) $10, Amazon

UrPower Hi-Fi Portable Wireless Stereo Speaker This Bluetooth-enabled speaker is loud, ultracompact, and nearly $40 off. What more could you ask for? Buy UrPower Hi-Fi Portable Wireless Stereo Speaker $19, URPOWER

Cable TV is awful (and expensive), and it still requires you to add on some bits and bobs to be able to access your ex-girlfriend’s friend’s uncle’s Netflix account. The Roku Express+ HD streaming stick fixes that by putting all of your streaming services in one convenient location. (Bonus: If you have a fancy TV, it can handle 4K resolution.) And at almost half off, it’s practically a steal. Buy Roku Express+ HD $22, Jet

Logitech Multimedia Speaker System If you want to feel bass in your bones — or just fill a room with some funky jams — these are the speakers for you. They come with a 3.5-mm audio-output port (a.k.a. a headphone jack), so you can easily plug them into your phone or computer, but with the sale slashing $20 off the original price, I’d suggest reinvesting some of that money in a cheap Bluetooth aux adapter to really complete the experience. Buy Logitech Z313 Multimedia Speaker System $30, Walmart

Roku Premiere+ It’s like the Express+ HD, only better. In addition to wrangling all of your streaming services together in one convenient location, the Roku Premiere+ streaming stick also gives you access to over 4,500 channels. (It can handle 4K resolution, too.) Normally it’s $100, but with this deal it’s half off. Score. Buy Roku Premiere+ Streaming Media Player $50, Best Buy

This Amazon bundle also comes with ten sheets of Rainbow Film and is 20 percent off. Buy Fujifilm Instax Mini 26 + Rainbow Film Bundle $55, Amazon

Midrange Buys

LG SH3K 2.1 Channel Sound Bar Sad but true: Most TV speakers suck, no matter how good the rest of the TV is. The LG SH3K has a couple of nice features (its subwoofer connects wirelessly) and is more than half off, down from $280 to $120. Buy LG SH3K 2.1 Channel Sound Bar $120, Best Buy

Apple Watch Series 1 The Apple Watch is absolutely wonderful. Seriously. It’ll make you feel like you’re living in the future while simultaneously helping you disconnect. It’s honestly so good that sometimes you’ll forget where your iPhone even is. (But don’t worry, if that happens, you can ping your phone with a quick tap on your wrist.) And at $70 off, the Series 1 — the classic, most cost-effective model — is practically a steal. Buy Apple Watch Series 1 $199, Walmart

iPhone 6 While you may not be able to unlock this one with your face, the iPhone 6 is a great smartphone, and that 50 percent off discount makes it only more irresistible. Buy Straight Talk Apple 6 32GB Prepaid Smartphone $199, Walmart

﻿PlayStation 4 Slim The PlayStation 4 debuted in late 2013, and in the four years since, it has thoroughly quashed all debate about whether it or Microsoft’s XBox One was the superior console. It has a better all-around performing system, a large online player community, and a tremendous backlog of great games to play through. If you’re in the market for a console and uninterested in what Nintendo is doing with its Switch, the PS4 is an easy choice, especially at $100 off. Buy PlayStation 4 Slim $199, Walmart

﻿Sennheiser HD1 Headphones Last year, we picked the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless headphones as the best wireless headphones, and the market agreed — they were popular enough that Sennheiser reissued the Momentums as the HD 1s. Same great sound, same noise cancellation that makes the roar of the subway disappear, and the same beautiful retro styling. The one difference? This pair is $100 off. Buy Sennheiser HD1 Headphones $250, Amazon

High-End Bargains

Samsung 58-Inch Class 4K (2160P) Smart LED TV Prices continue to plummet on 4K panels, thanks to fierce competition from manufacturers like Samsung. This 58-inch screen from Samsung isn’t top-of-the-line, but it’s 4K and supports HDR 10 — and with $200 off the list price, it rings up to a cool $598. Seeing this much TV for this little money just didn’t happen a year ago. Buy Samsung 58” Class 4K (2160P) Smart LED TV $598, Walmart

Samsung 4K Ultra HD TVs Samsung’s 4K Ultra HD TVs are seeing deep price cuts across all sizes, with more than 50 percent off everything from 49-inch up to 75-inch sets. All come with HDR, and Samsung is the name to beat when it comes to high-quality large-panel LEDs. If you’re looking to upgrade your main set, this is a nice price to do it at. Buy Samsung 49-Inch 4K Smart LED TV $698, Walmart

MacBook Pro 13-Inch If you’re looking to buy a new MacBook, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is the model to get. It’s got the slim form factor that makes it thinner and lighter than the final generation of MacBook Airs, but is cheaper than the Touch Bar models (and, frankly, the Touch Bar doesn’t add much utility). Slashing $150 off the 128 GB model and $300 (!) off the 256 GB model makes it an even easier decision. Good for anyone, and great for a college a student. Buy MacBook Pro 13-inch 128 GB $1,150, Best Buy

Rebecca Traister and Ross Douthat,"A conversation about liberal versus conservative pigs, structural ways to address harassment, and why some men feel compelled to behave this way.",2017-11-21T21:45:59.115Z,new-york-magazine,Rebecca Traister and Ross Douthat Debate the Post-Weinstein Moment’s Lessons,http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/11/rebecca-traister-ross-douthat-post-weinstein-lessons.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/11/21/21-Franken-Clinton-Weinstein-Moore.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Photo: Getty Images

A conversation about liberal versus conservative pigs, structural ways to address sexual harassment, the legacy of the sexual revolution, and why some men feel compelled to behave this way.

Rebecca Traister: Honest to God, what is WRONG with people?

Ross Douthat: Mostly testosterone, apparently.

RT: I thought your recent column on liberal pigs was really interesting. You say, “We’re finally in a moment feminist enough that we can identify the pigs amongst the left,” right? And we’ve seen it happen in recent weeks, not just with regard to Harvey Weinstein, who was the catalyst for that column, but with the conversation around Al Franken — kicked off by the right, but readily taken up by the left — and the public, long-awaited reevaluation of Bill Clinton. But I have to say, this part of the news cycle — where everyone is obsessing over whether Al Franken should resign and whether Bill Clinton should have or not — is wearing on me. I’m sure a cynic could read this as being defensive about fellow liberals. But I promise you it’s not that. I am all for reevaluating Bill and for hearing more about Franken, but I worry that the drive to render sentence is pulling focus from what should be being revealed here, which is the pervasiveness of the behavior, the way that the whole culture tells us that jokes about grabbing women’s breasts are funny, the way that a comedian who builds his career in part on telling those jokes can become a trusted public and political figure to begin with.

Which is not to say that Franken shouldn’t be trusted, and I happen to think he’s a great senator. But you know, Gilda Radner might have also been a great senator, but can we imagine the scenario in which she’d have been granted comparable public authority? That’s the part that I want to examine — not just individual villains and the degree of villainy they may have perpetrated, but rather how entire political and public power structures permit the rise of so many men who, regardless of the degree of their offense, wind up as both enablers of and enabled by their power advantages.

RD: Your weariness is completely understandable. But to defend the focus on specific men for a moment, for us to make social or moral progress there has to be a path to a cultural consensus on some of these questions, and we can’t reach a cultural consensus so long as everyone thinks they have to rally around *their* creeps, and defend behavior on their side that they’re busy condemning if it’s happening on the other side of our cultural civil war. So in that sense I think the consensus that liberals and feminists end up embracing Bill Clinton, and their willingness to decide (or not!) that they made a mistake rallying to him so strongly in the 1990s and treating his relationship with Monica as crucial in the defense of the sexual revolution, is actually quite important for the norms that we end up with going forward. A feminism that can handle its Clintons and Teddy Kennedys and (maybe) Al Frankens differently than in the past will be a more persuasive, coherent, admirable feminism. A feminism that just makes gestures in that direction once people are out of power or in the grave will not persuade many non-feminists or non-liberals that it should be the arbiter of moral norms.

RT: Right, I agree.

RD: Now you can ask me about how conservative Christians are doing when it comes to that kind of consistency, and I’ll shoot myself in the head (metaphorically of course).

RT: Right, I agree that a women’s movement that can be clear in its condemnation of its own side’s creeps-to-criminals (your mileage may vary) is going to be a more coherent and persuasive movement, though I’d add that as long as men continue to have such an unjust share of the political power, those same feminists are also rendered dependent on those creeps-to-criminals, for stuff that really is very crucial to feminism’s success. Which of course was part of what the problem was with Bill Clinton: His court appointments were critical to a feminist future; his presidency came after 12 years of conservative administrations; ceding his position to a Republican Party felt incredibly dangerous. Though there’s a very persuasive argument that the impeachment proceedings themselves, and a feminist incoherence on the subject of his sexual-power abuses, ultimately did long-term damage to both the party and the women’s movement that had just cohered around Anita Hill and her clarity about the material damage done by sexual harassment.

But since you bring it up, yes, I think it’s fair to say that the past few weeks have offered some evidence that the left is way more ready to condemn its own than the right. Though of course, it can also be said that the left is way less strategically sound than the right. Why has no prominent person said (as many of my friends have said conversationally) that Franken should resign at about the same time Donald Trump does?

RD: Well, now you’ve said it! But you’ve also said a version of the exact thing that induced many religious conservatives to hold their nose and vote for Trump. “His court appointments are crucial to protecting our institutions and to the possibility of limiting abortion, the 2016 election came after eight years of liberal aggression, ceding the White House for four more years feels incredibly dangerous, etc.” I listened to people make these arguments, I watched them vote for Trump on those grounds, and now of course they’re being asked to support Roy Moore for similar reasons.

But I want to believe in your counter, your suggestion that feminism did itself long-term damage by being incoherent. I want to believe that when any group that feels like they have to support a villain, whether it’s liberal women or religious conservatives, they actually have things backward, that you actually gain power — cultural power first, maybe, and political power later — insofar as you show a willingness to veto and restrain and punish on your own side. That feminism would have been better off if figures like Steinem and Friedan had used their (limited, but real) power to put Al Gore in the White House. That my fellow Christians would be better off if they used their (limited, but real) power to veto Trump, to veto Moore. But I admit that maybe that’s too hopeful.

RT: I want to push back slightly on the argument that the feminist reasoning behind defending Bill Clinton is precisely analogous to the conservative argument for voting for Trump, or now for Moore. Because the argument for keeping Clinton (which again: I’m not defending, just recalling) was in part that the power he wielded could theoretically shore up or increase the very set of policies and protections that are supposed to ameliorate the gender-imbalanced conditions that make sexual harassment so pervasive, i.e., it was to some degree a compromise on a feminist issue designed specifically to further a feminist agenda. I don’t think there’s the same moral symmetry with Trump voters: that they’ll vote for a man who spews open racism or is accused of groping women specifically because they think that if elected, he’s going to strengthen defenses for women or for people of color; in some cases, the opposite. This week, Kellyanne Conway said that voters should pick Moore because he’ll help pass the tax bill. Is there a line of logic that says that voters upset about pedophilia charges should vote for the accused pedophile, despite their distress, because a lower corporate tax rate would lead to a systemic reduction of child abuse?

RD: It’s not precisely the same, but many of Trump’s supporters framed it as “we’re compromising Christian values by electing a man who doesn’t live up to them, because that’s the only way in order to further a Christian agenda on abortion or religious liberty.” There’s some overlap with your view of how feminists thought about Clinton there.

RT: I also think there’s another similarity between our “sides” in this controversy — neither one has figured out exactly what kind of cultural/moral order they want to exist around sex. Religious conservatives can’t decide how much feminism they want to incorporate into a moral perspective that was entangled with patriarchy for centuries — so you have some evangelicals sounding feminist as they condemn Moore, while his defenders have a hard-edged patriarchal “believe the religious pillar of the community, not the silly girls who probably were asking for it” argument. Meanwhile, feminists are struggling, I think, to figure out how to enrich the moral language of “consent,” which seems too thin to handle power imbalances.

But when I go back through 1990s-era arguments, it is very striking how different the moral language used now is from the language feminists used during the Clinton affair, when there was a sense — maybe conditioned by partisanship, but also proceeding from what was then understood to be the logic of the sexual revolution — that being sex-positive meant justifying getting blowjobs from interns. And whatever else happens I do think it’s good if that is changing.

RT: I don’t think your view of feminism’s moral language having changed accounts entirely for the differences between today’s view on Lewinsky and a past view on Lewinsky. We have to remember that at the time — and still — everyone agreed that Monica Lewinsky was an active participant, an enthusiastic consenter, to the situation. And yes, the notion of consent is too thin to cover the gendered inequities around sex, but it makes her case far more complicated, because the harm done to her was less clear-cut, and because there was a (reasonable) feminist investment in the notion of adult women as sexually driven actors and not just passive victims. She is a very different case from Roy Moore’s underage accusers, from the women who claim Donald Trump assaulted them, or even the women who say Franken groped them. Of course, there were women just like Juanita Broaddrick who alleged nonconsensual encounters with Clinton, too, but their claims have only recently been reexamined with any rigor. That was its own category of error, but it’s also true that, as you point out, much of the feminist consideration of Bill Clinton hinged on Lewinsky’s agency. And I think a retroactive examination of the case makes the power imbalances far clearer, in part because we can see the unequal damage done to the people involved, which is of course one of the reasons that sexual power abuses are wrong; not just because the sex act itself might be damaging, but because the unequal parties face unequal risks when entering into them. And we can see that Monica Lewinsky (and in a different direction, Hillary Clinton) wound up paying far steeper prices for Bill Clinton’s trespass than Clinton himself did.

I’d also say that whatever the failures of the Clinton moment, many women on the left have in fact been calling out their side’s own monsters for a long time. In part, the second wave was born out of frustrations with the misogyny of the new left and within the civil-rights movement. There’s the famous story of the women going up on stage at a new left rally and the men saying, “Take her off the stage and fuck her.” But what is making people more receptive to hearing women on this subject right now in a way that they haven’t been?

RD: My mom was in the first class of women at Yale, so I do have some intergenerational familiarity with how progressive men behaved between the years of 1965 and 1980. But to answer your question, I think what’s happening now partially reflects the greater functional political power of feminism right now, as opposed to then. There are specific arguments around rape and sexual harassment that feminists have won since that era. And then on the level of what you could call the political substrate — and this is something you’ve written an entire book about — both the power and the sheer numbers of single women within the liberal political coalition has expanded dramatically. And the role of singleness matters because it means that there are more women who have an identity that is both empowered and vulnerable. By which I mean that there’s still a sense in which having a husband or even a boyfriend confers some protections against certain forms of male aggression, and so singleness both requires and summons up a certain kind of political solidarity, a class identity for professional women.

RT: I disagree with the notion that singlehood confers a special kind of sexual vulnerability in workplaces. Indeed, I was thinking as you were talking, There are lots of stories that I’ve read in the past week of women who had partners who were married, women who immediately got out of a horrible encounter with somebody — and call their husbands.

But structural disadvantages, like lower wages, lack of equal-pay protections and paid-leave policies — those things together work to make women more vulnerable to power abuses. One of the things that’s struck me about the conversation that’s been had in recent weeks is a lot of men saying, “I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” Including men at workplaces where I’ve worked. I’m reading them saying that they did know that it was a boys’ club. So what does that mean to them? That there were many more men’s bylines than female bylines: What does that mean? That there was, for a long time, no HR department: What does that mean? That there was no maternity policy until a colleague of mine went to argue for it for herself in 2013: What does that mean? They say, “I didn’t know”; but they did know that there were these structural disadvantages that don’t give women the leverage or stability to make claims, that leave them vulnerable to bosses taking certain liberties with the understanding that they don’t have labor protections.

RD: But that economic account is compatible with a “sociology of sex” account, too, right? The single woman in the workplace is seen as more available than if she were married, and she is also more economically vulnerable because she is relying more completely on herself and is therefore more vulnerable to the boss who can control her professional future.

This does even remotely excuse these men’s behavior, but I think there is a way in which a certain kind of liberal idea in our era — namely, the idea that the sexual imperative is so overpoweringly strong and should reasonably be the organizing principle of your life — does help the powerful men themselves justify their inability to control themselves. It creates this sort of all-purpose excuse for a certain kind of oversexed man who we’ve all known and probably not loved to say, “Well, you know, this is what, this is not just my base impulses. My highest good, my telos is to have sex with as many women as possible. So if I’m surrounded by them in the workplace, well, the workplace is a social environment, why shouldn’t I ask lots of them to have sex with me?”

There are obviously conservative elements in that idea, a strong patriarchal element. But there’s also just post–Hugh Hefner attitudes about sex as a good end unto itself, where you’re judged as a man on your ability to bed as many women as possible — to be able to brag that “I was sexually intimate with 50 very attractive females,” in the immortal words of that Ohio Supreme Court justice.

RT: I see two different categories. One thing that I agree is key to a liberal ideology that I view more warmly than you do is an idea of sexual liberation. But it’s true that some of the ways in which that sexual liberation was then immediately reworked to serve especially gendered power dynamics have been very damaging, creating a kind of libertinism that is very closely tied to the kinds of abuses that we’re seeing.

RD: My view is not that it was captured and reworked, my view is that it was that from the start. Basically, men saw an opportunity in the weakening of female-dominated religious culture in the 1950s, and they rebelled against it and created the Playboy and Polanski age in American life, which then, in turn, generated a strong and in certain ways successful feminist critique that accepted the idea that sexual liberation was an end worth seeking but also sought to constrain and eliminate the piggishness. But the heart of the project of sexual liberation is contained in the mix of commercialism and skin in Playboy magazine.

RT: So you are with Andrea Dworkin and Shulamith Firestone on this?

RD: Well … not all the way. But I do believe that there are elements in Dworkin-esque feminism that are truer than its rivals …

RT: Like what?

RD: I think neither the darkest possible feminist view of sex nor the most sex-positive view of sex are right. The truth is somewhere in between. But what Dworkin and others get right is that there’s a darkness and a predation inherent in liberation that sex-positivity is never going to allow you to escape.

RT: But that view of sexual liberation leaves out the women’s interests. There was also a very real and very serious investment by many women in sexual liberation and many of the developments that enabled it and were enabled by it, right? Whether it was birth control or legalized abortion or the ability to dress more freely and to talk about female pleasure and advocate for it, and to reconceive of women’s sexuality to begin with as an active and not just a passive force. So I don’t see it as inherently a dark and doomed project just because, even from the start, deep-seated power imbalances meant that men were profiting from it in certain ways and that women were paying for it in certain ways.

One of the reasons that we’re seeing this current predation conversation blow up in the way that it is blowing up with the Shitty Media Men list, the whisper networks —

RD: I still haven’t seen the list. No one has forwarded it to me.

RT: Well, the whole explosive nature of these kinds of lists feel very uncontrolled and radical; and that’s one of the characteristics that people talk about with regard to the campus rape movement: that it feels radical to them. And that’s what this moment feels like to me too.

Perhaps some pent-up frustration gets funneled into the intense conversation about rape and assault; because the thing we can talk about is nonconsensual sex, a criminal act. But we still can’t talk easily about the disgusting sexism that makes our sexual interactions — even the consensual ones —unequal and often ultimately unsatisfying for women.

RD: But the pervasiveness of that problem, as you describe it, also suggests the potential value of rules that try to desexualize everyday life. I think college campuses are a good place to talk about some of these questions because they are a controlled ecosystem involving people who are not yet full adults. And right now, the organization of college social life is highly sexualized, geared towards the idea that a kind of debauched mode of sexual encounter is supposed to be the collegiate norm. Do you think, in our current context, women would be hurt if there was more stigma around randomly hooking up? Is the idea just that any stigma that you implement will inherently judge women more than men?

RT: Yes. Any sexual stigma. Women are unfairly implicated for not hooking up at the moment.

RD: Yes, there are new stigmas to replace the old ones! But it seems striking to me that the post–sexual revolution landscape generates a stigma against what is often a more characteristically female view of sexuality — a view that emphasizes commitment, monogamy, and so forth.

RT: But those stigmas existed in different forms in earlier eras too. If you did have sex you were a total slut and by many measures then unmarriageable. But the alternative, which was to be the good girl with the hetero-coupled early marriage didn’t always produce results that were wonderful for women either.

RD: To be clear, I think that feminism in its third wave as well as in its previous waves has produced a lot of good things for women — and for men, but for women especially the gains are not something that anyone should want to throw away. The question that I try to raise, in my role as reactionary critic, is not: Why shouldn’t we just go back to 1945? Rather, because there are things about the post-sexual revolution landscape that clearly don’t work very well, we shouldn’t assume that everything people thought in 1945 was insane and of no use to us today.

In fact, there is no necessary reason why either chastity or permissiveness needs to be gender inegalitarian.

You can imagine a gender-egalitarian pro–sexual restraint argument as easily as you can imagine a gender-egalitarian pro-permissiveness argument. Either one is intellectually possible, but we’ve ended up in a place where the gender egalitarians think they must argue for sexual permissiveness.

RT: But I am, in fact, aggressively challenging the notion that sex-positivity alone produces the feminist gold standard. This notion that has come up around the college assault conversation that there are two categories: there is the idea that if the sex is consensual, it is something that women are enjoying or enthusiastic about. That’s how I view, at least, the pressures applied by a sex-positive attitude within a contemporary feminist conversation. And then, on the other side of this wall, there’s nonconsensual sex, which is its own category. My solution comes down to: We have to be better about acknowledging inequities on every level, about reengaging a conversation about sexual inequalities that I think we more typically associate with radical feminists of the ’70s. We have shut down that conversation because it’s uncomfortable and it’s one that complicates a notion of sex-positivity that we are politically invested in for all kinds of reasonable reasons.

RD: And I suppose I’m just trying to make a case against a certain kind of sex-positivity — meaning, in my understanding of the term, the view that the healthiest human society is one in which the most sexual desires possible are met. If you said, “What distinguishes sex-positivity from just a basic morality of consent?,” it’s the view that you assess the health of a society and the health of a human life, the sort of psychological social well-being of a person, by whether they are being given, and are seizing, the most possible opportunities to act on their real sexual desires. That’s a view that I’m against and I think is wrong.

RT: I see sex-positivity, at its best, as operating in contrast to a kind of protectionist sex negativity that characterized earlier feminism. It’s about a diversity of paths being open to people who might want to follow them. As long as they do not involve harm and damage to other people, right? Now, of course nothing takes care of the sort of hurt that human beings do to each other, you know, in terms of desire and rejection and attraction and infidelity. So I’m not pretending that sex-positivity is an ideal Utopia where everybody’s happy. Rather that I favor a system in which, structurally, we acknowledge, accept, and then support, to the degree that it’s possible — through laws, through benefits and social and economic policy — the choices made by people pursuing varied romantic and sexual paths.

RD: And I suppose I think a system that places more moral limits on people’s choices might both reduce some of that hurt and reduce some of the explicitly nonconsensual behavior that you condemn as well. And it doesn’t always have to be a formal system. The Shitty Men in Media List is actually an example of something like this. It’s an internet-age manifestation of the mechanisms for policing social life that existed in the world before third-wave feminism as well. Because while it was true that there were terrible double standards for male and female sexual behavior in the pre-1965 world, it was also true that women had real social power in those societies, and had mechanisms for essentially punishing through social exclusion men who misbehaved egregiously.

The problem that you run into is that it can lead to extremes where a man who has only been accused of something, with no definite evidence, isn’t just socially stigmatized but actually gets fired. But there, too, it might be more likely to be abused in a context where it’s an all-or-nothing moral standard — where you can’t talk about men in the “shitty” gray area because the only rule is consent, so it’s like, Well, if the guy did something bad we have to treat him like a rapist.

RT: So you weren’t chilled by the list?

RD: Well, again, I haven’t seen the list. So —

RT: You’re not on it.

RD: Then it’s great! It’s a brilliant social document!

I mean, look, to some extent I can identify with the men who are accused in ambiguous situations, because these guys were told that these were the rules, drunken hookups are normal, and that everybody is cool with sex now. And as we radiate outward from Weinstein, you do get into cases where I read some of the accusations and I think, Well, that’s not something a guy should lose his career over.

But then again in many of these cases there will be a first wave of allegations where you think, Well, some of those things aren’t so bad … but then that will encourage somebody else to come forward with something worse. And to me, that’s partially a vindication of broader norms and rules, because it suggests that the guy who breaks one minor norm is more likely to break another.

When the affirmative consent bill was being debated in California, Ezra Klein wrote a piece for Vox that was basically like, This is a terrible bill but I support it because it will make men afraid to behave badly. And I thought that was a bad argument because I don’t think making men afraid to behave badly is worth the miscarriage of justice involved in totally ruining somebody’s collegiate career over what is a functionally drunken hookup.

But punishing someone socially by having their name appear on an internet list doesn’t seem to me nearly as bad as kicking them out of college and ruining their professional career. Though admittedly if the list circulated really widely and was widely believed it could ruin them.

RT: But what’s remarkable is how many of them get hired anyway.

The history of men with bad reputations, even reported bad reputations, has not been one in which, so far, there has been unjust punishment meted.

I see this as fundamentally linked to the fact that there aren’t those women at the top of the power structure. There aren’t women at the top where the career stall is around childbearing, and, as we can now discern, around women who are chased out of companies and professions in part by patterns of male behavior toward them. We can debate whether or not there are natural impulses that women have towards staying at home or seeking jobs with more flexible schedules, but the fact is we actually just don’t have, for example, a paid-leave protection in this country so we can’t even wholly test that hypothesis here because we just don’t have it, nationally.

RD: And this is a place where we have policy common ground. But of course as a conservative one reason I support pro-family policies is that while I do think they would be better for women in the workforce, I would be also fine with them just encouraging women to have more kids.

RT: This feminist is all for regarding family life, and policy that better supports it, as a good — though crucially, not the only good.

But I would say that one of the other aims of those policies, if they were enacted, must be to also encourage men to pursue family life more.

RD: And that’s also a physiological way — I’m only half-joking here — to mitigate the problem of male predation. There is a fair amount of evidence that the amount of time that men spend with their own children is correlated to how much excess testosterone they have.

RT: Are you surprised by the impact of this moment? I was very cynical based on my memories of last year and Trump. I thought, This isn’t gonna last. But in the second half of October, I was like, Well, actually — First of all, I was startled that so many of these stories seem to include actual assault and rape —

RD: Plus all of the random masturbation in front of women.

RT: Did you know that was a thing?

RD: This is where my reactionary biases might mislead me. I do think porn has had some sort of weird effect on the male imagination. And that masturbation plus a morality of consent convinces some men to think, Okay, I accept that the rules say, I can’t actually rape you but under the rules of consent, I’m just standing over here, you know, doing my own thing.

RT: This is such the Rorschach test, because for me what it hammers home, the masturbatory stuff, is that it’s not about sex or contact or the other person at all —

RD: It’s about power, right?

RT: And humiliation. All of the details of these stories, the ass-grabbing while a photograph is being taken or while your wife is right next to you. The brazenness of some of it. Stuff that you’re like, Okay, it doesn’t rationally comport with desire. It conveys that the thrill is not in the contact, but in getting away with domination or humiliation and thus affirming your power.

RD: I think women shouldn’t underestimate the extent to which male sexual desire is distinctive and strange and (to women) irrational-seeming.

Saying “It’s power, not sex” excludes too much.

RT: That some sex is about power?

RD: That it’s always about sex. It might be about power in 17 different ways … but there’s still sex there at the heart of it. The masturbation in the plant is just not the same thing as Harvey Weinstein humiliating a male assistant. There’s a sex thing at the bottom of almost every case where someone says, “It’s about power, not sex.”

RT: This may be splitting hairs. I’ve heard that from a lot of men over the past few weeks. But women are saying this is about power. And as the people who don’t have the power, it’s very clear that it’s about power. It suggests to me that maybe a male sexual brain understands sex to be about power to begin with —

RD: Or the male sexual brain understands power to be about sex, to be a means to sex. Like the line from Scarface, the Tony Montana line: “First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women.” That’s not every male sexual brain … but that is a very male sexual brain, a very male way to think. Like with James Toback, where one of his friends said something like, “Oh, he was just doing that thing where if you ask 100 women to have sex with you randomly, one of them will.” That’s not a conversation I’ve heard since college — but it’s certainly a conversation that men have among themselves. And with Weinstein, maybe the idea is that you think you’re so powerful that your ratio isn’t one in a hundred, it’s 50/50 — or that that’s the goal. The goal is to achieve a level of power where you walk out of the bathroom naked and at least 25 percent of the time the woman is like, Well, I gotta go along with it. And so, yes, it’s about power … but the goal is still sex. As disgusting as that may seem.

RT: I’m shocked by the number of memories that have come up in the past few weeks. One of my memories is from an earlier job, at a party where I was talking to an older, married senior writer at an old workplace of mine, who was a friend of mine. I was single and he was like, “You’re gonna get laid tonight.” I made some self-deprecating joke, like, “I’m so bad at it that even if that was my thing I couldn’t figure out how to make it happen,” and he goes, “Don’t you know the rule? All you have to do is go put your hand on ten guys’ dicks and one of them is gonna sleep with you.” So I got the same advice.

RD: So you have heard the line!

RT: I got the same advice! But it’s not just James Toback asking 100 women for sex; it’s asking 100 women for sex by taking out his penis and offering to ejaculate on them. You’re in a weird area.

RD: This is, again, where I think porn makes the already overly literal male imagination that much more literal, by encouraging men to think about sex as something you do on a woman rather than something you do with a woman. And that, again, maybe explains part of the desire to masturbate in front of someone if they won’t have sex with you. It’s like, Well, that’s still sex …

See, this is the trap of doing a conversation with New York Magazine.

Jonathan Chait@jonathanchait,How the demagogic authoritarian alleged sexual predator decided to support the other demagogic authoritarian alleged sexual predator.,2017-11-22T02:12:02.367Z,new-york-magazine,Endorsing Roy Moore Is the Trumpiest Decision Ever,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/endorsing-roy-moore-is-the-trumpiest-decision-ever.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/26/26-roy-moore-2.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

President Trump’s decision to endorse Roy Moore for Senate in Alabama was so completely overdetermined, the only real mystery is why it took him so long. Still, two articles, one by Alex Isenstadt for Politico and the other by Jeff Zeleny for CNN, report out what led Trump to what was, for him, the obvious choice all along.

1. Trump was not certain the accusations, presented by numerous women and accompanied by an unusually large amount of contemporaneous evidence, were true. “During animated conversations with senior Republicans and White House aides,” reports Isenstadt, “the president said he doubted the stories presented by Moore’s accusers and questioned why they were emerging now, just weeks before the election, according to two White House advisers and two other people familiar with the talks.”

2. Other people have committed sexual harassment (though not against teenage girls). Zeleny:

Republicans familiar with the President’s thinking offered that explanation about his comments. They added that the conversation has dramatically changed since November 9, when The Washington Post broke the news of the allegations against Moore. Then, it was simply one bad actor — a Republican.

“Since then, it’s become much harder to tell who the bad guy is,” said a Republican close to the White House, noting that the allegations against Democratic Sen. Al Franken, the renewed chatter about Bill Clinton, the explosive revelations about legacy newsman Charlie Rose and the suspension of New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush were all developments the President was following closely.

3. Trump loves conservative voters, who are mainly standing behind Moore. Hence, reports Isenstadt, his “long-running reluctance to antagonize his conservative base” weighed in favor of a Moore endorsement.

4. Relatedly, the dreaded Establishment opposed Moore. Zeleny reports: “The president also increasingly found it distasteful to be siding with the Republican Establishment in trying to push out Moore, because it put him at odds with his base.” And Isenstadt adds: “As Establishment Republicans withdrew their support for Moore in recent days, one senior White House official said, the president remembered that many of those same figures abandoned him, too.”

These are the same disgusting people who thought a man caught on tape boasting about sexual assault should not be president — who could tolerate being on their side?

5. Trump likes the cut of Moore’s jib. “He has also come to identify with the candidate,” reports Isenstadt. He’s a lying sexual predator who refuses to recognize the legitimacy of any law that gets in his way — what’s not to like?

6. Trump was unsure Moore had a real chance before. But now, reports Zeleny, “Trump still believes Moore can win — and more importantly, two officials said, Trump didn’t think he would be able to stop Moore, so why risk another failure in Alabama by speaking against him and having him refuse to step down?”

7. The White House doesn’t care about sexual abuse. It likes winning. “It’s the general consensus that Moore and his policies are better than a Democrat. This makes it about policy and not the sexual-abuse allegations. The White House knows they cannot afford to lose an ‘R’ vote in the Senate,” a White House source tells CNN.

Huh, so people who work for Donald Trump think having an R vote matters more than holding a sexual assaulter accountable? Who’d have guessed?","suspension of new york times

Mallika Rao,“I honestly wanted to call it Seriously? I need to explain this?”,2017-11-22T15:33:52.235Z,new-york-magazine,Why Hari Kondabolu Had to Explain What The Problem With Apu Is to America,http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/hari-kondabolu-problem-with-apu-interview.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/16/17-hari-kondalobou-chatroom.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Photo: Getty Images

If you didn’t know Hari Kondabolu last month, you might know him now. The 34-year-old comic from Queens has seemingly been everywhere this fall, anchoring a raft of print, radio, and online coverage of his documentary, The Problem With Apu, which premiered Sunday on TruTV. The Indian-American resentment of Apu isn’t new to the people Kondabolu roped into the documentary, most of them South Asian–American actors and actresses such as Kal Penn, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Aziz Ansari, and Sakina Jaffrey (full disclosure: This writer appears in the documentary as well), but it can still confound those untouched by the shadow Apu casts, one of the imbalances that inspired Kondabolu to make a movie analyzing the cartoon character in the first place.

The term “soft racism” comes up frequently in coverage of the documentary, a term evocative of another recently in the news, “hipster racism,” after novelist Zinzi Clemmons used the latter to indict a wide section of the comedy world. In a Facebook post that went viral, Clemmons disavowed power players who excuse transgressions as “jokes.” Kondabolu’s frustration with The Simpsons similarly stokes easy dismissals, from the very people tasked to change things: Call out Apu, and you inevitably hear that The Simpsons makes fun of everyone, that its characters are all caricatures, that if you can’t take a joke, you should get out of the glow of the TV. As Ambudkar, the actor who voices Apu’s son in an episode created to update the character, after complaints went public, puts it: “The Simpsons always wins.” In Kondabolu’s doc, Ambudkar describes his regret when watching the episode after it aired. As he read it, its writing was designed to make critics of Apu look sillier than the character himself.

Nothing’s simple in representational politics. Vulture recently sat down with Kondabolu to discuss the making of a movie few comics would touch with a pole, how he positioned Apu in the annals of American race politics, and what lies ahead after tackling his nemesis, gloves off.

You got quite a crew.

It was almost everybody I wanted.

How’d you get them?

It was personal. It wasn’t something where I had to convince them. Think about the culture we’re in now. It’s not that everyone’s more thoughtful, it’s that you’re scared to not be thoughtful. You want to be on the right side of history, and you don’t even think about that character. Well, we think about it. Most of the people I pitched to, it’s like oh my god for them, it’s sitting right there.

It was fun to make a movie and to interview so many people, but the actual heart of the issue, it was a 101 course. I honestly wanted to call it Seriously? I need to explain this? Because we all know this. It’s obvious. But I had to educate people. There’s a part of the film where I had to be reminded, this is going to mainstream America. This isn’t a film that’s in festivals. I need to explain basic ideas. I really need to explain minstrelsy? I really do? And I’m like, yeah, I do. This stuff used to be called “inaccessible” though. We’re at least in the era where it’s now mind-blowing.

How do you think in terms of an audience where you are starting at square one about issues that are almost old hat to you?

You find the common ground. If I talk about the minstrelsy, that’s hard. If I talk about The Simpsons, we have shared ground. It’s this classic show that’s global.

The issue isn’t so much the character. I’m a 35-year-old man. It’s not an offensive thing, it’s a little insulting, especially when I was a kid. To me, it’s like, how did that happen, how does that still happen, how do we keep doing it? It’s not like it’s over. We still think about representation, we still think about erasure or one-dimensional representation. This is a classic example, but it’s one example. Apu is grandfathered in. It’s like a fossil in nectar, you know what I mean? It’s a great example for us to see because it’s both then and now. Times have changed, but ultimately for me it wasn’t just about Apu. It’s really about where we are as a culture and the fact that racism isn’t a singular thing. It’s a virus. It mutates, and every era, it changes.

The film spiraled out of a bit you did a few years ago for Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell. How did that come about?

I pitched the idea of doing the story [tied to the] Mindy Project premiere. He said I should do it, that it’d be more genuine.

Was that your first on-air segment?

That was my first one. I didn’t want to. I was like, This is Kamau’s show. I want to focus on him, as a writer. He was like, If you don’t do this I will fire you. I was like, Okay, you make a good point.

You’ve always been politically minded, and the question of Apu is about identity politics. But in general, do you feel pressure at all to talk about Indian stuff?

What I talk about onstage is what I want to talk about, it’s not like I’m thinking, This is the political angle. My first thought is, Who has the power in a situation and how are they using that power? I usually see myself as the person who has less power, so it’s natural to me that it’s observational more than it is political. But there is pressure at the end of the day.

Anything you wish you’d done differently with the film?

There’s this one anecdote we didn’t put in that kills me. I did some research, and Peter Sellers and Satyajit Ray knew each other [Editor’s note: Peter Sellers starred in The Party, in a role Hank Azaria has compared to Apu; Ray created The Apu Trilogy, the famous Bengali series that the Simpsons’ Apu got his name from.] Ray wanted Sellers to be in his first attempt for a film, called Alien. They hit it off. Then Ray saw Sellers in The Party and was horrified. I just met this man. This is what he thinks of me? And the voice he uses. Peter Sellers has a monkey pet in the movie. The monkey’s name is Apu, and that’s not a coincidence, especially during [the time of the release of Ray’s Apu Trilogy]. I hear that story and I think about Apu, the cartoon character. You take [Ray’s] main character and give him this voice you know he would hate. The fact that [Apu the monkey] wasn’t squashed — this is what happens when you don’t squash it. It doesn’t look the same way, but it still survived.

The casualness of those choices recalls the Dana Gould quote [in the Apu doc] about how it’s just funny — the Indian accent, that is.

I love the fact that Dana was so honest. People are like, How can you deal with Dana Gould being such a jerk? I’m like, he wasn’t a jerk. He was being honest. Do you want him to say sorry and move on? That’s not interesting.

That’s the great thing about the fossil quality of Apu. Yes it’s a fossil, but it’s a living fossil. You can access the people making it. They’re still in the business. Hank is still doing the voice.

It’s not enough to be simply aware that something is wrong. That Huffington Post piece that you’ve done [an article I wrote, in which Azaria commented on misgivings about Apu] — he was aware and still kept doing [the voice], kept doing it publicly. That’s so weird to me. A couple years after you and I did that interview [for the HuffPost story], they had Utkarsh [Ambudkar] on [to play Apu’s son]. To me, it was very much, Okay, we did our bit. We can keep doing Apu.

Did you hear the rumors that they were thinking of killing Apu off?

That’s lazy. If Apu dies, I’ll be the guy who killed Apu.

You wouldn’t be proud of that?

I’d feel mixed about it.

If he’s gonna do the voice, he’s gonna do the voice. Do I want a brown person doing it? I don’t want anyone to do the voice. If there’s some truth to the South Asian convenience-clerk trope, well, a lot of those people end up buying the business. How about we make him a small-business owner? He’s always an employee, subservient. Why don’t we get him an opportunity to own? His kids could be voiced by brown actors. There’s more creative solutions, but it’s easier to kill off the character than change. [Meanwhile] Smithers is out. It’s a cartoon. You can do whatever you want. It’s been 30 years. He’s been in the same place. Plus the show — it’s a little stale. That could give it a completely new angle.

Because what I love about The Simpsons is the creativity. That’s why Apu is so frustrating. It’s not creative, it’s hacky. Anybody could do that character. To kill him off is extremely lazy and a cop-out.

You’ve talked about not fitting into a “black-white binary” or Latino identity, which one could think of as the triad of American public identities. And I know in media there’s a sense, too, that East Asian or South Asian concerns are seen as secondary. A kind of, why do you have complaints? You’re not minorities — you’re just like white people. Or that using the language of the Civil Rights Movement or black actors is piggybacking, taking something that’s not yours. Is that an issue with the documentary? Do you have to justify even having problems, and figure out how to frame them?

I think it’s about how you explain your position. The importance of having Whoopi Goldberg [who appears in the film] is to talk about the larger legacy. I didn’t want something void of history. They’re going after brown people, but that’s not how this started. There’s a history of how people of color are used and how their bodies and images are monetized. Any South Asian in this country has faced it considerably easier [than black people]. When we talk about big moments, we talk about 9/11. You’re being held by law enforcement, seen as a threat. Black people deal with that every day. So it’s from this large legacy, but it’s not the same.

There are moments where I wish I were clearer because that’s important. To say, this is not the same. It’s part of the larger [story].

[At this point, a group of kids ran into the café where we were sitting, in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. It was Halloween, and they wanted candy.]

I grew up in Queens. This is what it was like. We had community. Not necessarily running into shops [for Halloween]; we had homes to go to. But this feels closer to home than other neighborhoods in Brooklyn.

I actually wanted to ask about your childhood.

Oh, yeah, I’m so sorry it couldn’t work out with my parents. [I’d hoped to interview Hari at his family home.] My dad had a heart procedure.

I’m so sorry to hear that.

It’s fine. He’s fine now. I mean, he’s an older South Asian man. He eats too much rice.

It comes for all of us. Speaking of South Asian, can you talk more about Queens? I have this magnetic pull to it, and am actually thinking about moving there.

Where would you go?

When I go, I go to Jackson Heights. [Where all the Indians live.]

If I’m going to go to Queens, not with my folks, I would go to Jackson Heights. It’s gentrifying. Put another brown face there. When I saw the Starbucks, I was like, This is not good. When I saw the indie coffee shop, I was like, This is the end.

Did you grow up there?

Until I was 9. Then we moved to Floral Park, Queens, which turned into a more suburban Little Asia.

Was it indian?

Lots of Malayalis. [Indians from Kerala]. You’re Telugu, right?

No I’m Kannadiga. Rao is common to both.

Were your people Telugu when they moved?

Actually, no. My mom’s family was Maharashtran at some point, before they became Kannadigas. My dad’s side is Tamilian, from Coimbatore.

It’s funny because if we talked to someone from the north, they’d be like, you’re the same. Where is Kannada spoken? Is that Bangalore?

Yep.

I did a gig there, when I toured India.

Is the documentary playing in India?

I hope so. If not, I don’t care if it’s bootlegged or not. I wish it weren’t, but I want people to see.

I’m already getting emails, messages from there, Europe. The reach of this film is massive. It’s a Simpsons movie above all else, and people love The Simpsons. It’s part of their childhoods, a huge influence. And no one has ever made a film critical of The Simpsons. This is the first. It’s also a little nerve-wracking to think about how I was going to deal with the [backlash] in comedy and Simpsons fans and people who hate anyone who doesn’t like something. That’s another reason why the whole Hank Azaria not participating thing annoys me. [Editor’s note: The film follows Kondabolu’s attempts to talk to the actor.] I put my butt on the line to do this at the end of the day. If you think it makes you look bad [not to talk], I think it looks better if you do.

The Dana Gould rule.

Dana Gould was gutsy. The doc would have been different if we had Hank. We had to use archival stuff instead.

I’m surprised because, with me, he wanted to talk about it. He sort of wanted to come clean.

We spoke on the phone. It’s not on the film because it was a private phone call. It’s public information, but we didn’t film it. I was geeking out. I’m a Simpsons fan, and here’s the voice of Mo, on the one hand.

What did he say?

He was like, “You’re really funny. I‘ve watched your stuff. What you’re doing is really great. But I’ve been involved in docs and I’m worried about throwing myself at the mercy of your edit.” The compromise is we do the interview done by Marc Maron or Terri Gross so I can’t screw with the edit. And I said yes because the film’s about accountability. He said he’d think about it. He gets back to me and he said no. That was the mail that I read in the movie. I’m like, what else can I do? I gave you the thing you said you’d need if you want to have an open discussion recorded by a third party. What else can I give you? At the end of the day, either he or Fox was against doing this project. I sympathize with him. It’s not an easy place to be in when you’ve played this character for so long and things change. But at the same time, you’re not 24. This isn’t your first job.

Even I get weirded out by how much things have changed sometimes. Like, how are we able to talk about his?

It’s crazy that no one ever said it was weird [before now]. No one even said, kind of.

A friend of mine, her theory about the minimizing of the Asian experience is that white people don’t want another group to feel bad about. Which I thought was interesting. How much can the culture apologize for? I think at some level there’s that.

That’s so selfish though. Who cares about apologies? Apologies don’t mean anything. It’s what can we do to make something better. It’s a public thing that influences a lot of people. Sure, there are some things as I’ve gotten older I’ve had to change and learn to understand. Gender, sexuality. Those are areas where I didn’t think critically when I was 15. But I never stopped learning. I always learned. That’s our responsibility as humans to try to listen and respect as much as possible where each other is at. I’m in the industry as well, and I have different pressures. I’m a stand-up and not necessarily as famous [as Azaria]. There’s a way to balance your professional responsibility and your growth at the end of the day. I hope we do have a conversation that allows us to talk about how come there aren’t more writers of color on staff, including on The Simpsons.

One of the most compelling arguments in favor of diversity — one of those words that can shut people’s minds off as soon as they hear it, because it feels like such a chore — is that it shouldn’t be a chore. The quality of creation gets better from an objective standpoint the more diverse the people dreaming it up. Like, do you want to be doing bad comedy or cutting-edge comedy?

This is boring to some degree to me and it is cutting edge to a lot of people. There’s a backlog. Chris Rock talked about this with Marc Maron, about his time on SNL. Even though the writers were incredible writers, they didn’t know how to write black [referential] comedy. When they had sketches of them they’d use these broad stereotypical images everybody knew. They only knew the hits, they had no subtlety, no understanding of the deeper repertoire.

The deep cuts of black culture. Whereas we know all the deep cuts for white people. We have to. I think that imbalance can be frustrating. I’ve had to study white people.

If I don’t study white people, I can’t understand anything. If I watch Can’t Hardly Wait and my first thought is — they’re white, I can’t enjoy this — then I can’t enjoy anything. Meanwhile, if there’s a lead or there’s one or two black characters, it’s a black show.

They have the option to experience a totally white culture. For us, it’s much harder to isolate yourself in that way.

For our survival, we have to make sure we don’t isolate ourselves. If we keep it to ourselves it’s going to make it difficult to make money or move forward.","kal penn utkarsh ambudkar aziz ansari

Nicholas Quah,From cuisine-based comedy to gourmet philosophizing.,2017-11-22T20:56:04.453Z,new-york-magazine,6 Appetizing Food and Cooking-Themed Podcasts for You to Savor,http://www.vulture.com/article/best-food-cooking-podcasts.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/22/podcasts/22-food-podcasts.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"There’s this thing I used to do (and still do occasionally, depending on who’s around) that I’ve come to view as the fundamental experience of contemporary popular food culture: While eating lunch, I’d watch old episodes of Chopped, or something from Anthony Bourdain’s extensive documentary oeuvre, or read the “Tables for Two” section in The New Yorker. Lunches just ended up tasting better that way, as if the episode or restaurant review is some sort of flavor-enhancing miracle berry that can turn even cold leftovers into something more sumptuous.

More astute minds, like Cari Romm writing for The Atlantic, have explored the pornographic tendencies baked into popular food media, and how it mines the relationship between food and sex. Those parallels can be most contemporarily detected in the regal slow-mo of Chef’s Table or the high-velocity editing of Top Chef. (I reckon this is the part where I’m supposed to cite the writing of Honoré de Balzac, the 19th-century French novelist largely understood to be the first writer to bring sexy food writing into literature with an omelette, but I’ve never read him.) Fans of food entertainment have been conditioned to be seduced by cooking.

It’s curious, then, that we don’t seem to hear much gastronomic sensualizing in food-related radio and podcasts. (Not yet, anyway.) Carnal sensibilities seem to be less present in podcasts, where the medium’s effectiveness tends to come from the more cerebral and contemplative. But that doesn’t make cooking-themed audio programs any less enjoyable. As Thanksgiving nears, here are some outstanding food podcasts to graze on.

The Kitchen Sisters Present

Hosts: Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva

Publishes: Every two weeks(-ish)

Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, the legendary duo of radio producers also known as the Kitchen Sisters, are perhaps most recognized for their NPR series Hidden Kitchens, a gorgeous body of non-narrated documentary work that is part anthropology, part historical appraisal, all love letter. Each installment explores the many quiet, often overlooked spaces where communities gather around food, and where culture subsequently emerges: from the front lines of the Civil War to post-Stalin Soviet Union, from a legendary club in Austin, Texas, to the Japanese-American diaspora.

These days, you can find their work primarily through Radiotopia’s The Kitchen Sisters Present podcast. “There aren’t a lot of sizzles and yums punctuating the action,” Nelson and Silva told me about their approach to the work. “It’s more about creating a mood and sense of time and place through language, storytelling, sound, music, and archival audio … Not to pit audio against great food writing, film, and video, but for us there is something about the voice … It’s intimate, speaking directly into your ear, memory, and imagination.”

The Sporkful

Host: Dan Pashman

Publishes: Every Monday

Dan Pashman is an earnest documentarian and a sprawling showman, with a show mixing celebrity interviews, multipart features grounded in a culinary idea or a place, and perhaps most intriguingly, the pursuit of answers to quasi-academic questions. (Sample inquiry: “Is a takeout burger a lesser burger?”) The Sporkful’s style is passionate, obsessive, and surgical, and Pashman is at his most philosophically effective when the show uses food as a springboard to a much bigger caper. In a recent multi-episode arc, which also ran as a segment on the New Yorker Radio Hour, Pashman embarks on a hunt to re-create a dish made by a famous sandwich shop in Aleppo, Syria, that, given the current conditions of the country, may no longer be there. “We all know the power of biting into a food, and have it trigger a memory,” he narrates at one point in the piece. “Of having a food transport you to … a place, and it seems especially powerful to be transported to a place that doesn’t exist anymore.”

To Pashman, audio is effective because it leans on the audience to do the heavy lifting. In his mind, video tends to deny a sense of visceral ownership. “You see a juicy cheeseburger and you’re instantly hungry, but it’s someone else’s cheeseburger,” he explains to me. “Audio is interactive. When we talk about a cheeseburger on The Sporkful, you bring your own experience to the image that you get in your mind. It’s YOUR cheeseburger.”

Spilled Milk

Hosts: Molly Wizenberg and Matthew Amster-Burton

Publishes: Every Thursday

Not all food podcasts are so experientially driven, of course, or deal with emotional and earnest questions of culture so directly. There are shows that utilize the subject matter more as a starting point for debate, discussion, and comedy. Spilled Milk, a conversational podcast by the Oregon-based writers Molly Wizenberg and Matthew Amster-Burton, bills itself more as a “comedy podcast about food” rather than a food podcast. “We strive to be accurate and cover a wide range of food,” Amster-Burton said, “but our primary goal is to make people laugh.”

Gastropod

Hosts: Cynthia Graber and Nicola Twilley

Publishes: Every other Tuesday

Then there are shows that approach food as a rich subject for historical and scientific analysis, which offers up more intellectual pleasures. Gastropod, by Cynthia Graber and Nicola Twilley, is one such production, where the team is particularly fixated on the tiny details and processes that go into the things we put in our bodies. “I want the behind-the-scenes of food — the fact that the Mafia got its start in the citrus business, the way orange juice is de-oiled and stored for years in tank farms — rather than a look at how to use citrus in cooking or a profile of a grower,” Twilley explains.

The show is fun, mischievous, and delightful in its rampant curiosity. “We notice something, we read something, we hear about something, and then that sparks questions that we want to try to answer in the show,” Graber said. Episodes can get pretty wonky, which is just as well if you’re going to go deep on, say, the toxicity of the fungus that’s responsible for a lot of the flavor profiles in Japanese cuisine, or the startling ubiquity of something called MegaPurple in, shall we say, cost-friendly wine. (Much love to Two-Buck Chucks.)

Milk Street Radio

Hosts: Christopher Kimball, with Sara Moulton

Publishes: Every Friday

Milk Street Radio is an extension of the chef and TV personality Christopher Kimball’s broader instructional food-preparation media empire, and the show’s structure directly reflects that: There are segments discussing this or that topic in the food world, a section discoursing on a recipe, a special guest interview, and a prominent call-in feature deployed throughout where Kimball and co-host Sara Moulton dispense advice to inquiring callers. (“The wonderful thing about shellfish is that they give you the liquid you need,” etc., etc.) If you’re not hitting up Milk Street Radio for the tips, there’s still something enormously comforting about letting the show run and wash over you; it tickles the back of your hairs the same way that, say, ASMR videos do for some.

The Splendid Table

Host: Francis Lam

Publishes: Every Friday

The Splendid Table is a more soulful affair, and its approach seems to cut so much closer to the core value proposition of food radio. Hosted by the award-winning food writer Francis Lam, who took over from longtime host Lynne Rossetto Kasper earlier in February after her 21-year run, The Splendid Table shares Milk Street’s classic radio-magazine structure, but under Lam’s gentle and thoughtful touch, the show is essentially one long, unceasing, ever-iterating meditation on the formation and variation of food culture. In this, the show shares the vivid aesthetic sensibilities of the Kitchen Sisters and the Sporkful, but The Splendid Table expresses of all that through cultural appraisal.

“One of the things I really appreciate about the show is how it can make the world a little bigger for you — how it’s full of ideas and possibilities and ways of eating and cooking that may be different than what you know,” Lam said. “There’s such a thrill you get from the podcast when so much of our media comes at us so fast, and from so many directions, such that we’re never really able to focus on one thing. I think that, combined with our natural inclinations towards the delicious and with our feelings to how we eat and cook, it creates what can be a profound relationship between the listener and food.”","twobuck chucks milk street radio

Edward Lewis,"The Dallas Cowboys' offense hasn't been effective the last three weeks. Dak Prescott, who admitted the O is in a ""funk,"" said it's a problem the Cowboys have to get fixed.",2017-11-24T01:44:17Z,nfl-news,Prescott: Cowboys' offensive 'funk' is 'not fun to be in',http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882123/article/prescott-cowboys-offensive-funk-is-not-fun-to-be-in,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/23/0ap3000000882109_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Dak Prescott turned over the ball eight times last season. In his last three games alone, the Cowboys' sophomore quarterback has eight turnovers.

Those numbers lead a bevy of eye-popping stats that tell the story of just how broken the Cowboys' offense, which scored just six more points in a 28-6 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Thursday, really is.

Dallas has just two touchdowns in its last 12 quarters. Prescott hasn't thrown for more than 200 yards in any of those three games. No running back has broken the 100-yard plateau, and an offensive line bothered by an injury to left tackle Tyron Smith (groin/back), who returned Thursday, and then right guard Zack Martin, who left Thursday's loss with a concussion, has given up 14 sacks in the past three games after allowing 10 in the first eight tilts.

Prescott isn't sure how to fix it. He just knows it's a problem the team needs to address.

""We're in a funk, or whatever you want to call it, and it's not fun to be in,"" Prescott said. ""We've got to figure out ways to get out of it. Me individually and just this offense collectively, we got to get back to work and continue to do that and just, like I said, figure out what's going on and get out of this.""

With Smith returning Thursday after missing the Cowboys' previous two blowout losses, the problem is fairly easy to identify: Without Ezekiel Elliott, nothing about the Cowboys' offense is right.

Alfred Morris and Rod Smith have combined to fill in respectably, but they're no Elliott. Without the threat of the All-Pro tailback's home runs, playaction hasn't been effective. Defenses haven't committed as many to the box, and a slow receiving corps has been exposed.

Prescott, though, wouldn't lay all the blame on Elliott's six-game suspension.

""If you're turning and trying to point the finger at the reason we're not having success is another guy or this or that, then you're not going to get it in this league,"" Prescott said. ""So I mean the last thing I'm doing is pointing the finger and saying we need this guy, we need that to happen. We just got to figure out what's going on and get out of this funk.""

If the Cowboys don't snap out of it soon, their playoff hopes, which are already on life support, will evaporate. At 5-6, they likely need to win out to have a shot at a wild card spot. Though beating the Washington Redskins next week seems unlikely if Prescott and the offense continue on the path they've gone down the last three weeks.","tyron smith groinback

Kevin Patra,The Los Angeles Chargers (5-6) headed to Dallas for Thanksgiving and celebrated the holiday with a 25-point second half to whitewash the Cowboys (5-6) 28-6. Here is what we learned from the blowout.,2017-11-24T00:47:43Z,nfl-news,Philip Rivers carves up Cowboys for Chargers in win,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882099/article/philip-rivers-carves-up-cowboys-for-chargers-in-win,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/23/0ap3000000882090_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The Los Angeles Chargers (5-6) headed to Dallas for Thanksgiving and celebrated the holiday with a 25-point second half to whitewash the Cowboys (5-6) 28-6. Here is what we learned from Thursday's blowout:

1. Philip Rivers dive-bombed a crumbling Cowboys secondary with a slew of huge pass plays. The Chargers' quarterback heaved eight passes of 20-plus yards, including chunks of 46, 42, 38, 32 and 31 yards. Rivers blitzed a Cowboys defense that didn't force a punt all game. The efficient L.A. QB finished a remarkable 27-of-33 passing for 434 yards, three touchdown tosses and zero interceptions. Much has been made about the Cowboys' offensive line injuries and Ezekiel Elliott's suspension, but the defensive collapse -- zero sacks, zero turnovers the past two weeks -- without Sean Lee has played a massive part in the poor showings.

2. Keenan Allen (11 catches for 172 yards, TD) and Hunter Henry (5 for 76, TD) diced up Cowboys cover men all game. Allen was uncoverable for the second straight week, beating Dallas defenders off the line of scrimmage with ease, and breaking tackles on the second level. The receiver weaved his way around poor tacking attempts for the game-sealing 42-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter. When Allen and Henry are heavily involved, the Chargers' offense can be one of the most dangerous units in the AFC. L.A. is now 5-1 this season when Henry gets at least five targets and 0-5 when he does not.

3. The Cowboys' offense remained stuck in the mud without Elliott. Dallas had gone 26 straight possessions over 10 quarters without a TD before Rod Smith's TD plunge early in the fourth quarter. Dallas went 154 snaps between TDs, according to CBS. Facing a Chargers run defense giving up 138.9 yards per game and 4.9 yards per attempt entering Thanksgiving, Dallas couldn't get anything going on the ground early sans Elliott. Running backs Alfred Morris and Rod Smith combined for 47 yards on 10 first-half runs. Down big in the fourth quarter, Dallas abandoned the run. Without Elliott, the Cowboys have been outscored 92 to 22 over three games.

4. Dak Prescott again struggled to earn chunk yards through the air. With Dez Bryant stymied by Chargers corner Casey Hayward -- zero first-half targets -- Prescott ran a constricted offense. Dallas' lack of separation speed on the outside allows defenses to squat on short routes, forcing the Cowboys QB to throw into tight windows. A struggling Dak played it conservative early before forcing a back-breaking pick-six in the red zone and another INT on the next possession to effectively end the game.

Tony Romo says Dak Prescott's play today could be a result of throwing three interceptions Sunday night. ""He's protecting the football. He's got to let it go a little bit and trust his reads."" â Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 23, 2017

With teams not respecting the run, the play-action passes have been ineffective, and Dak has been in a bevy of long down-and-distant situations. Thursday's performance was another reminder of the massive effect of Elliott's suspension.

5. The Cowboys got left tackle Tyron Smith back this week but lost another key offensive lineman during the game. Zach Martin left with a head injury in the first half and was ruled out with a concussion. Joe Looney replaced the All-Pro right guard. Martin's absence was a blow to an already struggling Dallas offense. On a key third down on the opening drive of the second half Looney was burned by Joey Bosa on an inside stunt, forcing a throwaway and punt. Prescott was sacked twice on the day.

6. Chargers kicker Nick Novak missed an opening-drive field goal and hurt his back on the attempt. The injury caused L.A. to go for it on 4th-and-13 from the 16-yard line on the next possession -- turned over after a 12-yard gain. Novak returned for a chip-shot 22-yard field goal late in the first half but later missed a PAT. Punter Drew Kaser took over the kicking duties from there, missing two of three PATs. In a blowout, the Chargers left at least nine points on the field.

7. Sun glare in AT&T Stadium could have cost the Cowboys. Rookie corner Jourdan Lewis dropped a would-be interception in the second quarter with the score tied. It appeared Lewis lost the ball in the sun and had it deflect off his hands, falling harmlessly to the turf. The Chargers marched down for a 22-yard field goal to take a 3-0 lead at halftime.

8. The Thanksgiving win puts the Chargers in the thick of the AFC playoff hunt at 5-6. The schedule sets up for Rivers & Co. to make a run toward January. L.A.'s remaining schedule: vs. Browns, vs. Redskins, at Chiefs, at Jets and vs. Raiders. With a weak AFC field, the Chargers have the talent on both sides of the ball to overcome the disastrous early-season start and make the playoffs. Only one team has started 0-4 and made the playoffs: the 1992 Chargers.

The fourth home loss of the season drops Dallas to 5-6 and well behind a cavalcade of NFC teams. With games remaining against the Redskins, Giants, Raiders, Seahawks and Eagles, the Cowboys will likely need to run the table to return to the playoffs.","redskins giants raiders seahawks

Marc Sessler,"In the first of three Thanksgiving Day tilts, the high-flying Vikings (9-2) proved too powerful for the Lions (6-5), who head home for supper sitting three games behind their purple-clad rivals.",2017-11-23T21:17:00Z,nfl-news,"Vikings overpower Lions, take control of North",http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000881905/article/vikings-overpower-lions-take-control-of-north,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/23/0ap3000000881897_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"In the first of three Thanksgiving Day tilts, the high-flying Vikings (9-2) proved too powerful for the Lions (6-5), who head home for supper sitting three games behind their purple-clad rivals in the NFC North. Here's what we learned from Minnesota's 30-23 win over Detroit:

1. This game mimicked countless Lions games previous, with Matthew Stafford facing deficits of 13-0, 20-3 and 27-10, but refusing to cave in. The Lions quarterback wiped away the memory of an ugly first half with a beautiful 43-yard touchdown strike to Marvin Jones that cut Minnesota's lead to 27-23 at the dawn of the fourth quarter. Ford Field went silent following the score as Stafford (20-of-35 passing for 250 yards and two scores) hobbled to the sideline after tripping backward and rolling his ankle over a Vikings defender. The tough-as-nails signal-caller returned to the field, but it was not to be, as Stafford -- clearly affected by the injury -- tossed a killer pick to Xavier Rhodes with three minutes left in the game. The Vikings, winners of seven straight, effectively drained the clock from there to seal the final score.

2. Minnesota fans are tired of hearing about the Eagles, Saints and Rams mentioned before the Vikings as a legitimate Super Bowl threat in the NFC. Their agitation is on point. Backed by a balanced roster with dominant players on both sides of the ball, surging signal-caller Case Keenum completed 14 of his first 18 throws en route to another clean day with 282 yards through the air, two scores and no turnovers. He cooled in the second half, but Keenum has never displayed better field vision, looking off reads and picking perfect moments to use his feet to move the chains. With coordinator Pat Shurmur dialing up another masterful game plan and Minnesota's line playing as well as any league-wide, Keenum's play has been elevated to new heights. Make no mistake, though, he's grown personally in the realm of quarterbacking artistry, showing appropriate aggressiveness downfield while protecting the ball. Whispers of a switch under center simply don't ring true after another sturdy performance.

3. The lack of a ground attack has killed the Lions all season. What else is new? They haven't had a back run for 100 yards in a game since Reggie Bush turned the trick on Turkey Day 2013. The result? Endless extra pressure on Stafford to save the day. Ameer Abdullah (6/14) and Theo Riddick (5/20) offer flashes of brilliance, but too much of that comes in the passing game. Imagine what a player like Le'Veon Bell -- nay, even a functioning chain-mover -- would do for play-action and the overall balance of this attack. Supported with just 40 yards on the ground from his backs, Stafford was forced into far too many obvious passing scenarios. It's unfair to say he doesn't have talent around him -- Marvin Jones (6/109/2) and Kenny Golladay (2/61) were sensational and Golden Tate is a massive asset -- but the lack of balance makes it tough for Detroit to command game flow.

4. It wasn't his wildest outing of the year, but Adam Thielen continued to do Adam Thielen things on Thursday with 89 yards off eights grabs. His pristine route-running gives the Vikings wideout a step on defenders before his impressive strength allows him to wrest the ball away from enemy hands at the point of contact. He's a chain-mover who can hurt you as a third-down possession guy or deep down the field. Matched with Stefon Diggs (5/66) and Kyle Rudolph (4/63/2), Thielen looms as an obvious All-Pro selection in the NFC.

5. Everson Griffen and his wife Tiffany welcomed a baby boy just hours before the game. The Vikings edge rusher celebrated with a second-quarter sack of Stafford before notching another in the second half, giving him 12 takedowns on the year. Griffen authored these heroics before even having the chance to name his newborn son.

6. For all of Minnesota's success, the glory doesn't extend to Kai Forbath, the team's embattled placekicker who missed a pair of field goals last week and saw an extra point blocked Thursday before the same happened on a 53-yard attempt before the half. The hold was bobbled on the missed field goal, but Forbath has been a concerning enigma of late.

7. Calling Keenum for taunting on a third-down sack that saw him casually flip the ball to the ground while sitting on the turf? That might have been the capper from a cast of zebras who also failed to see a comprehensive case of pass interference on Detroit just plays earlier.

8. The streaking Vikings now go on the road against the Falcons and Panthers over the next two weeks before facing the Bengals, Packers and Bears to close out the year. The Lions, meanwhile, don't see another team with a winning record all year, with dates against the Ravens, Bucs, Bears, Bengals and Packers in their suddenly shaky quest for a playoff spot.","ravens bucs bears bengals

Safety Mike Mitchell (ankle) was limited after practicing fully Wednesday.,2017-11-23T19:45:00Z,nfl-news,Injuries: JuJu (hamstring) misses another practice,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000881771/article/injuries-juju-hamstring-misses-another-practice,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/23/0ap3000000881823_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"After landing in Detroit on Wednesday, Dwight Freeney just missed the cut to play for the Lions on Thanksgiving Thursday.

The veteran pass rusher was inactive for their Turkey Day loss to the Minnesota Vikings. The Lions signed Freeney after he was cut by the Seattle Seahawks following their Monday night loss.

Defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, on the other hand, was active after being listed as questionable to go with a back injury. Ansah was limited in practice all week. Linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin also returned after missing the last two games with an ankle injury.

The Lions were also without leading return man Jamal Agnew, who was previously ruled out with a knee injury. Agnew leads the league in punt return average (16.8) and return TDs.

On the Vikings' side of the ball, tackle Mike Remmers was inactive with a concussion, while defensive end Brian Robison (back) and safety Andrew Sendejo (groin/hamstring) were active.

Here are the other injuries worth monitoring:

1. Lions center Travis Swanson left against the Vikings with a knee injury and did not return.

2. Los Angeles Chargers receivers Mike Williams (knee) and Travis Benjamin (abdomen) were both active against the Dallas Cowboys. However, Williams was carted into the locker room in the first quarter and did not return to the game. Kicker Nick Novak briefly exited with a back injury but returned in the second quarter, only to leave once again.

3. Cowboys guard Zack Martin did not return against the Chargers with a head injury. Owner Jerry Jones told reporters after the game that he is in the concussion protocol. Kicker Dan Bailey (hamstring) was active and played against the Chargers, while backup kicker Mike Nugent was inactive. Tackles Tyron Smith (back/groin) and La'el Collins (back) were both active.

4. The Washington Redskins announced star left tackle Trent Williams (knee) was inactive for their game against the New York Giants. Defensive lineman Matt Ioannidis (ankle) did not return.

5. New York Giants linebacker Curtis Grant was carted off with a knee in the first quarter against the Redskins. He did not return. Linebacker Deonte Skinner (hamstring) and cornerback Donte Deayon (jaw/forearm) both did not return.

Wide receiver Sterling Shepard was inactive as he still battles migraines. Cornerback Eli Apple was a healthy scratch for the second straight week.

6. Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler (concussion) returned to practice in a limited capacity.

7. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (Achilles) and tight end Rob Gronkowski (illness) were both limited in practice after sitting out on Wednesday. Tight end Martellus Bennett (shoulder/hamstring), wide receiver Chris Hogan (shoulder), center David Andrews (illness) and tackle Marcus Cannon (ankle) did not practice.

8. Devonta Freeman is inching closer to a return to the field. The Atlanta Falcons running back was limited in practice Thursday, though he remains in concussion protocol. Wide receiver Julio Jones (ankle/knee) was also limited for the second straight day.

9. The Chicago Bears officially placed pass rusher Leonard Floyd on injured reserve on Thursday. Floyd was carted off with a knee injury last Sunday against the Lions. Bears coach John Fox told reporters that Floyd will soon undergo surgery to repair a MCL/PCL injury. In a corresponding move, Chicago signed linebacker Howard Jones from the practice squad to the active roster.

10. Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (hamstring) did not practice for the second consecutive day. Safety Mike Mitchell (ankle) was limited after practicing fully Wednesday.

11. Green Bay Packers defensive tackle Kenny Clark (ankle), linebacker Clay Matthews (groin) and running back Ty Montgomery (ribs) did not practice Thursday.

12. Philadelphia Eagles kicker Jake Elliott (concussion) returned to practice Thursday.

13. Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald missed practice Thursday because of an illness. Receiver Robert Woods (shoulder), cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman (thigh) and linebacker Mark Barron (hand) did not practice for the second straight day. Cornerback Kayvon Webster (concussion) was limited after missing practice Wednesday.

14. Kansas City Chiefs linebackers Dee Ford (back) and Terrance Smith (concussion) did not participate in practice for the second straight day. Linebacker Tamba Hall (knee) and defensive end Allen Bailey (knee) were both limited.

15. Buffalo Bills wideout Kelvin Benjamin (knee), tackle Cordy Glenn (foot/ankle) and running back Mike Tolbert (hamstring) did not participate in practice. Wideout Jordan Matthews (knee) was limited.","andrew sendejo groinhamstring

Tamme played alongside two elite starting quarterbacks for the bulk of the career: Peyton Manning in Indianapolis and Denver and Matt Ryan in Atlanta. When Manning left for the Broncos in the 2012 offeseason, Tamme went with him. The tight end played in two Super Bowls -- Indy's loss to New Orleans in 2010 (XLIV), Denver's loss to Seattle in 2015 (XLIX) -- in which he tallied two receptions for nine yards.

Tamme was drafted out of Kentucky by the Colts in the fourth round of the 2008 draft. He finished his career with 259 receptions, 2,570 yards and 14 touchdowns.","pictwittercomyflhvisntc

Marc Sessler,"Both Sean McVay and Sean Payton stand out as Coach of the Year candidates, but Rams coach doesn't want people comparing him to the Saints' head man.",2017-11-23T14:26:00Z,nfl-news,Sean McVay: I'm not in the same category as Payton,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000881741/article/sean-mcvay-im-not-in-the-same-category-as-payton,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/23/0ap3000000881742_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"With every passing minute, we draw closer to Sunday's much-anticipated Sean-Off.

That's right: Sean Payton's high-flying Saints (8-2) against the upstart Rams (7-3), a rowdy, points-generating operation conducted by first-year head coach Sean McVay.

Both stand out as Coach of the Year candidates, but McVay doesn't want people comparing him to Payton, the Super Bowl-winning offensive architect with a decade-plus of head-coaching experience.

""I think he's accomplished so much I don't think it's fair to put me in the same category as Coach Payton,"" McVay said, per The Times-Picayune. ""I think hopefully if you achieve even close to what he has in this league then maybe you start to get mentioned.

""I think in terms of looking at the trajectory and being around some of the same people, it's certainly flattering words, but I definitely have not done enough to be mentioned in the same sentence as Coach Payton.""

It's easy to point out parallels with both coaches serving as celebrated offensive minds who brought quick success to their teams. Payton and Drew Brees descended on New Orleans in 2006 and turned the franchise around, while McVay, at the tender age of 31, has spun magic with Jared Goff and the previously unwatchable Rams.

Coaches don't spend much time comparing themselves to fellow coaches, but Payton played along when asked Sunday's head-to-head duel.

""The first similarity would be S-e-a-n,"" Payton said. ""Now, outside of that, he went to Miami of Ohio. I coached there.

""There are a lot of good friends on his staff I know -- (offensive line coach) Aaron Kromer, (defensive line coach) Bill Johnson -- guys that've worked here. I think there's confidence you build. You go set up shop, you get your opportunity but I've never had a chance to work with him outside of that so I wouldn't know. But he's doing a good job there.""","the

Marc Sessler,Eagles coach Doug Pederson has witnessed the transformation firsthand for Carson Wentz in Year 2 and believes the same can happen for Bears first-rounder Mitchell Trubisky.,2017-11-23T13:49:00Z,nfl-news,Doug Pederson: Mitchell Trubisky can be Wentz 2.0,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000881733/article/doug-pederson-mitchell-trubisky-can-be-wentz-20,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/23/0ap3000000881739_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Last year, Carson Wentz was a raw-but-promising rookie for a middling squad from Philadelphia. Today, he's an MVP candidate who leads the league in touchdown throws as one of the game's brightest young stars.

Eagles coach Doug Pederson has witnessed the transformation firsthand and believes the same can happen for Bears first-rounder Mitchell Trubisky.

""Oh, for sure, for sure,"" Pederson said ahead of Sunday's clash with the Bears, per ESPN's Jeff Dickerson. ""We knew last year with Carson as a rookie that there were going to be growing pains and we were going to take some lumps. And also, listen, we just weren't very good as a football team last year, too, and didn't have the surrounding pieces around Carson. You kind of see in Mitch, you see the arm talent, you see the athleticism, the strength. You see good decisions, the accuracy. You see things that flash on tape that you go, 'OK, that's exactly the way Carson was a year ago.'""

They aren't the same player, but Trubisky -- like Wentz -- has shown flashes of brilliant play during his six pro starts. Chicago's coaching staff barely allowed him to throw the ball early on, but his past three outings have asked him to do more.

The rookie did his part last week, extending plays, finding downfield targets and using his legs to move the chains in a tight loss to Detroit that saw Trubisky put the team in position to win before Connor Barth botched a last-second, 46-yard field goal in a 27-24 loss.

""He successfully got us in position to succeed,"" offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains told the team's official website. ""For him to take us down and get us into field-goal range was a big step in his growth.""

Trubisky's coaches see weekly progress from the newbie, while Pederson sees evidence of that shared DNA with Wentz.

""That's always a positive when you have an athletic quarterback that you can use outside of the pocket, a big, physical guy like that, and you're seeing the flashes like we saw in Carson,"" Pederson said. ""You continue to spend the time with him. You continue to develop. He gets a full offseason coming up, where like Carson you get time away but at the same time you can focus in on your offense and your skill set, and you'll see big strides from Year 1 to Year 2 in this kid.""","mitchell trubisky

On Tuesday, they waived the pass rusher.

The move raised some eyebrows, given the fact that the Patriots gave up 2018 fifth- and seventh-round picks for the player prior to the season. Marsh's production, though, had waned in recent weeks, with the defensive end not logging a tackle since Week 8.

On Wednesday, the San Francisco 49ers claimed the defensive lineman off waivers.

The Niners had front-row seats to watch what Marsh could bring to their roster when he was with the rival Seahawks. The pass rusher had some previous success in Seattle, particularly in his final season, when he notched three sacks and one start.

The Patriots filled Marsh's vacated roster spot, meanwhile, by adding defensive end Eric Lee off the Buffalo Bills' practice squad.","seattle seahawks

After being released by the Seattle Seahawks on Tuesday, Freeney was claimed by the Detroit Lions on Wednesday, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per a source informed of the situation. The team later confirmed the news.

There was speculation the 37-year-old pass rusher, who has openly talked about retirement the past two years, might have played his final snap after his departure from Seattle. With the Lions grabbing him, that talk is on hold once again.

Freeney was a surprise cut by the 'Hawks, given he had three sacks in just four games this season. The Lions, obviously appreciating that production in limited playing time, added him with the hopes of bolstering a pass rush that has been lacking. Detroit has just 21 sacks this year, tied for 20th in the league.

Lions coach Jim Caldwell told NFL Network's Stacey Dales that Freeney will not suit up for Thursday's game against the Vikings, meaning the veteran's Motown debut will come Week 13 against the Ravens.","nfl networks stacey dales

Nicholas J. Cotsonika,"Each Thanksgiving, we step back, gain perspective and express gratitude for what we take for granted. In the United States this year, Thanksgiving falls three days before the 100th anniversary of the founding of the NHL.",2017-11-23T05:00:00Z,nhl-news,Giving thanks for 100 years of NHL memories,https://www.nhl.com/news/giving-thanks-for-100-years-of-nhl-memories/c-293252418,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293254046/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Each Thanksgiving, we step back, gain perspective and express gratitude for what we take for granted.

It's time to look back at how we got here and appreciate all we have: 31 teams across North America with players from around the world, when once there were three teams in eastern Canada and no Europeans, let alone an Australian like Nathan Walker of the Washington Capitals; a game that pushes the pace up ice, when once passes were backward only; players dressed in high-tech fabrics whipping synthetic sticks with curved blades, when once they itched in wool sweaters lugging wood sticks with flat blades; stats, highlights and broadcasts accessible with a click, when once you had to listen to the crackle of the radio and wait for the printing of the newspaper.

What would the founders think of the NHL today?

A few of the many things for which to be thankful:

Eddie Livingstone

If not for the combative Toronto owner, his counterparts in the National Hockey Association wouldn't have formed the NHL at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal on Nov. 26, 1917. Long story short, they created a new league to cut him out. ""We ought to pass Eddie Livingstone a vote of thanks for solidifying our league,"" said George Kennedy, then owner of the Montreal Canadiens, according to the book ""Total Hockey."" The NHL began with five franchises: the Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Ottawa Senators, Quebec Bulldogs and a new Toronto team that would be known as the Arenas, the St. Pats and eventually the Maple Leafs. But the Bulldogs didn't play at first, and after the Westmount Arena in Montreal burned down, the Wanderers folded.

[RELATED: NHL celebrates its birth in return to Montreal's Windsor Hotel]

The forward pass

Nothing changed the game more. Not until 1927-28 were players allowed to make a forward pass in the defending and neutral zones. In 1928-29, a forward pass was allowed into the offensive zone if the player receiving it was in the neutral zone when it was made. To start the 1929-30 season, forward passing was allowed in all zones but not across either blue line. Scoring jumped, and midway through the season, the NHL went to essentially the same offside rule we have now. Hockey went from a game of rushes and retreats to a game of passing and playmaking.

The Stanley Cup

Lord Stanley of Preston, the governor general of Canada, donated it. Different leagues competed for it from 1893 until 1926, when the Cup came under the control of the NHL. It's become the most recognizable trophy in sports, the prize awarded after more than five months of regular-season games and two months of Stanley Cup Playoffs, a test of will and skill. Its beauty, its history, its names stamped in silver, its passing from champion to champion and hand to hand, set it apart.

Expansion

Teams have come, gone and moved since the beginning. The NHL had three teams for most of the 1917-18 season and all of 1918-19, then as many as 10 before the ""Original Six"" era from 1942-67. Now it has 31 with the addition of the Vegas Golden Knights, and has had one move since 1997 (the Atlanta Thrashers became the Winnipeg Jets in 2011). The NHL is in many places and in a much better place, continuing to grow and evolve. Auston Matthews grew up rooting for the Phoenix Coyotes, became the No. 1 pick in the 2016 NHL Draft and now leads the team from Toronto that was formed in that meeting 100 years ago.

Video: Memories: The NHL doubles in size in 1966

Overtime

The NHL eliminated regular-season overtime on Nov. 21, 1942, because of wartime restrictions on train schedules. The League didn't reinstate it for four decades, with 5-on-5 sudden death for up to five minutes in 1983-84. It went to 4-on-4 in 1999-2000 and 3-on-3 in 2015-16. The action now hardly leaves time to blink, let alone think.

The greats

The League unveiled the 100 Greatest NHL Players presented by Molson Canadian in January. How can you not be thankful for Wayne Gretzky, Gordie Howe, Mario Lemieux, Maurice Richard, Bobby Orr and all the others who set the highest standard on and off the ice?

[RELATED: 100 Greatest NHL Players]

The not-as-greats

At the same time, how can you not be thankful for the other 7,500-plus players who have appeared in the NHL? Each is great relative to the rest of us, and sometimes your favorite player isn't the best. He's the guy you admire for his grit, his guts, his goatee, whatever.

The fans

If that's sappy, well, it's Thanksgiving. Just as it's special to share the holiday with family and friends, even with those with whom you have differences, it's fun to enjoy the game with others, even with those rooting for the other team. Without fans, there is no NHL. The first two games in NHL history were played Dec. 19, 1917; one drew 700 fans. The NHL's average attendance last season, including the playoffs, was 17,579. Total attendance: 23,151,388.","wayne gretzky gordie howe mario lemieux maurice richard bobby orr

Amalie Benjamin,"They are lined up in a row: Peter Cehlarik, Danton Heinen, Jake DeBrusk, Rob O'Gara. They are names that were supposed to be here, in the dressing room at the Boston Bruins practice facility, but not yet. Not so many of them. Not all at once.",2017-11-23T17:00:00Z,nhl-news,Bruins getting lift from rookies while injuries mount,https://www.nhl.com/news/boston-rookies-playing-major-role-in-early-success/c-293242606,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293243212/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"BOSTON -- They are lined up in a row: Peter Cehlarik, Danton Heinen, Jake DeBrusk, Rob O'Gara. They are names that were supposed to be here, in the dressing room at the Boston Bruins practice facility, but not yet. Not so many of them. Not all at once.

But that option -- waiting -- is no longer a luxury the Bruins have. There are too many injuries, too many missing bodies this season. With half the roster out at any given time, from forwards David Backes to David Krejci, Brad Marchand to Patrice Bergeron and Ryan Spooner, to defensemen Torey Krug and Adam McQuaid, to goalie Tuukka Rask, the Bruins have become far more reliant on rookies than any team would prefer.

And while it's not always perfect, there is a glimmer of hope for the future in the sometimes eventful now.

""You're blending in more and some days you're seeing it work really well for us,"" coach Bruce Cassidy said, mentioning the Bruins' 3-1 win against the San Jose Sharks on Saturday, when all three goals were scored by rookies (Cehlarik, DeBrusk, and Heinen). ""The other night, without them do we win the game? Who knows? But other nights it's been a challenge.""

Video: BOS@SJS: DeBrusk's impressive breakaway marker

Because it's just not just that the Bruins have had so many rookies in and out of the lineup this season. It's that they are relying on rookies night in and night out, on their top lines and in their top defensive pairings. They have been tested over and over, with another test coming against the reigning Stanley Cup winners, the Pittsburgh Penguins, in the 2017 Discover NHL Thanksgiving Showdown on Friday (1 p.m. ET; NBC).

This was all part of the plan. Sort of.

""We were hoping to create [internal competition] in the summer,"" Cassidy said, citing Anders Bjork, Heinen, DeBrusk, Kenny Agostino and Zach Senyshyn - all forwards -- as candidates for that competition. ""It started that way and then with all of the injuries, now it's not internal to beyond the team, it's internally to who gets to play up and play the minutes because they're all in the lineup.""

They have made the transition, all in a bunch. And they have relied on each other to make that transition, with groups of them living together, counting on each other. Defenseman Charlie McAvoy, the one guaranteed rookie to make the team out of training camp after his performance as a pinch hitter the Stanley Cup Playoffs last season, is rooming with Bjork, who is now also injured. Heinen, DeBrusk and Sean Kuraly also share an apartment. Agostino and Senyshyn are currently with Providence in the American Hockey League.

""I think maybe the young guys have gotten a little closer because we've been a group, going through the same things,"" McAvoy, 19, said. ""It's nice when you have other people you can lean on that are feeling the same things that you're feeling, going through the same experiences.

Video: BOS@LAK: McAvoy beats Quick with nifty backhander

""I think we've come together and we've gotten pretty close over the first couple months here. I anticipate us becoming even closer as we go here.""

Which is good, for them, and for the future of the Bruins, which has come quickly.

When the Bruins parted ways with former general manager Peter Chiarelli, now the GM of the Edmonton Oilers, part of the criticism of his time in Boston was a lack of draft picks that panned out. There was little in the system, little promise, even though the team had won a Stanley Cup and made a Stanley Cup Final in his time there.

But now some of those picks are blossoming, with Cehlarik, a third-round pick (No. 90) in the 2013 NHL Draft, Heinen, taken in the fourth round (No. 116) in the 2014 NHL Draft, and Bjork, a 2014 fifth-round pick (No. 146), all making impacts. Add to that picks that came out of the drafts since Don Sweeney became GM in May of 2015, like DeBrusk, the No. 14 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft and McAvoy, No. 14 in the 2016 NHL Draft, and there is hope. (And that doesn't even count 2014 first-round pick David Pastrnak (No. 25) and 2015 second-round pick Brandon Carlo (No. 37), both of whom are now established NHL players.)

Video: BOS@SJS: Cehlarik pots rebound for his first NHL goal

""I think this is something that the management has talked about for a while is that you have the Stanley Cup champions in here, so you have the guys that have been here and won before, and then you have the younger group of guys like myself and DeBrusk (age 21), Bjork (21), Heinen (22), you can go on,"" McAvoy said. ""I think the direction this organization is going is something anyone can be excited about.""

So, yes, the Bruins got young and got young fast, by necessity.

""We're hoping we're more dynamic, up-tempo team,"" Cassidy said. ""We've added skill to the lineup. We feel it's more skill with the DeBrusk, Bjork, Peter's now in that mix, Charlie, obviously. So if you blend that with [David] Backes, [Bergeron], [Zdeno Chara ], McQuaid, [Kevan] Miller, the whole Bruins hard-to-play-against with the new way the game's going, that's how we'd like to be.""

It's a mix, he said, of brawn and finesse. It's a mix of the team's past and its future.

And as for that game on Saturday, that day when, at the end of a difficult three-game West Coast swing, the Bruins rookies were the ones that pulled it out, that pulled the team up, that sent it home triumphant, that could be a turning point.

""Maybe this trip was the beginning of seeing [progress],"" Cassidy said. ""I don't want to speculate, but it could be. You always look back during the year at times where you go, wow, that was a defining moment where the team went north or the team goes south.

""We're hoping that's a defining moment for these younger guys, a tough environment, they did well. Hopefully it's a precursor to good things coming. I'm an optimist. That's the way I'm going to look at it.""","david backes bergeron zdeno chara mcquaid kevan miller

Dan Rosen,Lightning forward Nikita Kucherov chosen by NHL.com panel as League MVP through first quarter of season.,2017-11-23T05:00:00Z,nhl-news,Kucherov early favorite for Hart Trophy,https://www.nhl.com/news/hart-trophy-tracker-nikita-kucherov-early-favorite-league-mvp/c-293213344,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293213522/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Tampa Bay Lightning forward Nikita Kucherov is a rink rat who'd prefer to work in the shadows of teammates Steven Stamkos and Victor Hedman.

To mark the completion of the first quarter of the season, which arrived Tuesday, NHL.com is running its second installment of the Trophy Tracker series this week. Today, we look at the race for the Hart Trophy.

""It's good for me if I don't have to say anything [to the media],"" Kucherov told NHL.com prior to the start of the season. ""It's good to have those guys in the room.""

Stamkos and Hedman can't cast a shadow long enough to cover Kucherov this season. They can't shield him from the cameras, from the spotlight, the accolades and the adulation. Kucherov's 70-goal pace 20 games into the season doesn't allow him to lie in the weeds anymore.

Video: DAL@TBL: Kucherov finishes off attack with tap in

Kucherov is NHL.com's favorite to win the Hart Trophy through the first quarter of the season. He is first in the League with 17 goals and second in points with 33, three behind Stamkos. Each has played 21 games.

""Now, the hockey world is seeing we have a star,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said.

Kucherov showed the hockey world his star power last season, when he had 85 points, including 40 goals, in 74 games. Those numbers felt even more impactful to the Lightning because he put them up despite not having regular linemates because of injuries.

Kucherov and Stamkos combined for 41 points in the first 17 games last season, but a knee injury took Stamkos out for the final 65 games. The Lightning missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs by one point; hardly Kucherov's fault.

Stamkos is healthy again and, with Vladislav Namestnikov (nine goals, 12 assists) on the left wing of the Lightning's top line, they've rediscovered the chemistry they had early last season.

Stamkos finished second in NHL.com's Hart Trophy vote through the first quarter. They're in line to be the first teammates to be finalists for the Hart since Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux (Pittsburgh Penguins) finished second and third, respectively, in 2000-01.

""Obviously, they've picked up with the chemistry they had when they played last year for those first few games,"" Cooper said. ""Probably most importantly, though, [Kucherov] really, almost methodically, works at his game. Whether it's his release, his one-timer, his change in direction while moving and shooting, he constantly is doing that.""

That's the rink rat element that has been so important to Kucherov's growth from a 30-goal scorer two seasons ago to a 40-goal scorer last season to a potential 70-goal scorer this season.

Video: TBL@LAK: Kucherov scores beauty on a breakaway

""When he shows up in Tampa, Florida, in July, when it's 100 percent humidity and nobody is here, and he's renting out the ice himself to work on his game,"" Cooper said, ""I see how his production totals have gone up.""

Work ethic on the ice is also a key factor. It's not as if Kucherov is standing around and waiting for Stamkos to set him up, or waiting to set up Stamkos.

Kucherov's vision and intelligence, Cooper said, are significant and underrated parts of his game.

""He sees what's going to happen next in the game before the player he's going against sees it,"" Cooper said. ""It's impressive. Like, he's such a sneaky little forechecker because he knows what the defender is going to do before the defender knows what he's going to do. That's why he often comes away with pucks, because he's so good at that.""

Kucherov has been so good at everything this season, bringing the spotlight on himself, even if he'd prefer the coverage of the shadows.

""People talking, like 'He's a star,' or something like that, I'm not putting that in my head and thinking about it,"" Kucherov said. ""If I do, my game is going to go a different way. I just focus on my game. We're here for one reason, to make the playoffs and win the Cup.""

Voting totals (points awarded on a 5-4-3-2-1 basis): Nikita Kucherov, Tampa Bay Lightning, 83 points (13 first-place votes); Steven Stamkos, Tampa Bay Lightning, 56 points (five first-place votes), Vladimir Tarasenko, St. Louis Blues, 20; Anze Kopitar, Los Angeles Kings, 16; Mark Scheifele, Winnipeg Jets, 15; John Tavares, New York Islanders, 13; Alex Pietrangelo, St. Louis Blues, 12; Connor McDavid, Edmonton Oilers, 11; Blake Wheeler, Winnipeg Jets, 9; Drew Doughty, Los Angeles Kings, 4; Mark Stone, Ottawa Senators, 4; Auston Matthews, Toronto Maple Leafs, 4; Alex Ovechkin, Washington Capitals; 3; Johnny Gaudreau, Calgary Flames, 3; Erik Karlsson, Ottawa Senators, 3; Jaden Schwartz, St. Louis Blues, 3; Corey Crawford, Chicago Blackhawks, 3; Sergei Bobrovsky, Columbus Blue Jackets, 2; James Neal, Vegas Golden Knights, 2; Roman Josi, Nashville Predators, 2; Andrei Vasilevskiy, Tampa Bay Lightning, 1","andrei vasilevskiy tampa bay lightning

Mike Zeisberger,"When a storm system covered Toronto with a two-inch blanket of snow earlier this month, Patrick Marleau's four sons couldn't wait to test out this unfamiliar gift from Mother Nature.",2017-11-23T17:00:00Z,nhl-news,Marleau adjusting to lighter travel schedule with Maple Leafs,https://www.nhl.com/news/toronto-maple-leafs-patrick-marleau-adjusts-to-lighter-travel/c-293258272,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293258740/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"""Having spent all their lives in California, this was all new to them,"" Marleau said. ""They couldn't wait to get out there and do snow angels.""

TORONTO -- When a storm system covered Toronto with 2 inches of snow earlier this month, Patrick Marleau's four sons couldn't wait to test out the unfamiliar gift from Mother Nature.

The move from San Jose to Toronto this offseason certainly has resulted in a different lifestyle for Marleau's sons, Landon, 10, Brody, 8, Jagger, 6, and Caleb, 2, with the approaching Canadian winter arguably the biggest change.

Though a good dumping of snow is nothing new for Marleau, who grew up in Aneroid, Saskatchewan, his decision to leave the San Jose Sharks after 19 seasons and sign a three-year contract as an unrestricted free agent with the Toronto Maple Leafs on July 2 has brought a significant adjustment of its own.

""For sure, it's been the travel,"" Marleau said. ""It's been a lot different.""

A year ago, goalie Frederik Andersen went through the same transition after being traded by the Anaheim Ducks to the Maple Leafs.

For teams on the West Coast like the Sharks and Ducks, road trips often are multicity, mile-gobbling journeys that involve changing time zones a handful of times. For players like Marleau and Andersen, this was a part of life in the Western Conference.

As such, packing a suitcase in the East seems a much simpler task.

Perhaps that's why Marleau and Andersen each broke into a mischievous grin earlier this week when the Maple Leafs' upcoming schedule, which features 14 of 18 games on the road beginning with a 2-1 shootout loss to the Florida Panthers on Wednesday, was brought up.

Some local media outlets have portrayed the run as a grueling stretch. Marleau and Andersen certainly don't see it that way.

""In general, instead of being away for a week or two, there are a lot of one- and two-game trips,"" said Marleau, whose Maple Leafs play at the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday (7:30 p.m. ET; FS-CR, TSN4, NHL.TV), before returning home to play the Washington Capitals on Saturday. ""Go to Montreal and come back. Go to Ottawa and come back. It's different in that respect. There, once you are on the road, you stay there awhile. Here you are back and forth a lot.

""There's certain things that are positive about being on the road. You're in a group, in a team concept type of thing, going out for dinners, things like that that can help us win.""

According to ontheforecheck.com, the Sharks will travel 45,407 miles this season, 10th in the NHL. The Maple Leafs will travel 35,689 miles, 27th in the League, fewer than all but the Detroit Red Wings (34,759), Buffalo Sabres (34,175), New Jersey Devils (34,052) and Pittsburgh Penguins (34,041).

Video: BOS@TOR: Marleau nets tic-tac-toe goal for OT winner

Since taking over as Sharks coach in 2015, Peter DeBoer has employed a plan featuring more off days and optional practices in order to combat the travel schedule. It's a recipe that Marleau and his former Sharks teammates claim kept them rested during their run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2016.

""I came to appreciate the benefit of showing up at the rink with as much energy as possible on game day, and not overcoaching on the off days,"" DeBoer said. ""I think the players appreciated it too.""

Marleau certainly did during his final two seasons with the Sharks.

""I think with the travel out there, you get home late after a back-to-back, you get that next day off,"" he said. ""It was a lot more geared to getting ready for games, not as many practices.""

To Marleau's point: During one stretch last season, San Jose played 16 games in 31 days, including five back-to-backs, three of which were on the road.

Interestingly, Andersen in some ways preferred the travel in the West, claiming he'd like to be on the road for longer chunks of the schedule.

""I would complain about the East schedule,"" he said. ""I would rather string together a bunch of road games in a row and then stay home for a stretch. I think that's what they do in the West a lot more. Here in the East we've got to take a lot of short trips, obviously a lot more shorter flights. That's kind of my take on it.

""I know it's probably different for guys with families and kids. They don't want to be away too long. But I think it's good for them to get out of the house too.""

Either way, Andersen understands the importance of the Maple Leafs making the most of these next 18 games.

""At the end of the day, it matters how many points we can gain in this stretch,"" he said. ""If we can get through this with a good amount of points, it'll be huge for us. Then again, it won't matter that much if we don't take care of business on home ice.""

The Maple Leafs will start 2018 with six consecutive games at Air Canada Centre, beginning with a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Jan. 2. By that time, there should be plenty of white stuff on the ground for the members of the Marleau clan to make their beloved snow angels.","marleaus sons landon

John Kreiser,"Any good feelings that the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins enjoyed during the Thanksgiving holiday figure to be long gone by the time they take the ice at TD Garden on Friday for the 2017 Discover NHL Thanksgiving Showdown (1 p.m. ET; NBC, NHL.TV).",2017-11-23T06:51:23Z,nhl-news,5 Reasons to watch Penguins-Bruins,https://www.nhl.com/news/five-reasons-to-watch-pittsburgh-penguins-boston-bruins/c-293288868,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293290364/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Any good feelings that the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins enjoyed during the Thanksgiving holiday figure to be long gone by the time they take the ice at TD Garden on Friday for the 2017 Discover NHL Thanksgiving Showdown (1 p.m. ET; NBC, NHL.TV).

Each team is fourth in its division and has been up and down this season. Pittsburgh went 7-3-1 in its first 11 games but has struggled since then, going 4-6-2 in its past 12 games and losing 5-2 to the Vancouver Canucks at home on Wednesday. Boston has won three in a row, including a 3-2 shootout victory at the New Jersey Devils on Wednesday, after losing four straight.

Here are 5 reasons to tune in:

Crosby in spotlight

Sidney Crosby's season has mirrored that of his team. The Pittsburgh center had 10 points (five goals, five assists) in his first 10 games; since then, he's been limited to seven points (one goal, six assists) in his past 13 games. Crosby hasn't been having much puck luck; his 8.0 shooting percentage this season (six goals on 75 shots) is less than half of his percentage last season (17.3), when he led the NHL with 44 goals. Great players usually play their best when they're needed most, and with the Penguins struggling to win, expect a big game from No. 87, who has 45 points (12 goals, 33 assists) in 33 regular-season games against Boston.

Video: BUF@PIT: Crosby nets rebound for power-play goal

Bergeron's impact

Crosby's job is to generate goals. Patrice Bergeron's job is to keep him from doing just that. The Bruins center can score; he had a goal Wednesday and has 13 points (five goals, eight assists) in 15 games. But it's his skill without the puck that makes him special. Bergeron has won the Selke Trophy as the NHL's top defensive forward four times in the past six seasons, including 2016-17, and finished second the other two times. He's also among the NHL's best at face-offs, winning 56.8 percent of his draws this season.

Video: BOS@NJD: Bergeron fires wrister into wide-open net

Home sweet home

Whether at the Boston Garden or the building now known as TD Garden, Boston has never been a fun place for the Penguins to visit. The Bruins are 5-0-1 against the Penguins in Boston since the start of the 2013-14 season, and they're 67-22-2 with six ties at home against Pittsburgh since the Penguins entered the NHL in 1967.

Kid stuff

The Bruins defeated the Devils on Wednesday when 19-year-old defenseman Charlie McAvoy scored in the 11th round of the shootout. McAvoy, Boston's first-round pick (No. 14) in the 2016 NHL Draft, is one of a handful of kids who've been making an impact with the Bruins after getting a chance to play because of injuries. Forward Jake DeBrusk, a first-round pick (No. 14) in the 2015 NHL Draft, had a goal against New Jersey, and forward Danton Heinen, a fourth-round pick (No. 116) in the 2014 NHL Draft, had an assist Wednesday to extend his point streak to four games. McAvoy has 10 points (two goals, eight assists) in 20 games and led Boston in ice time against New Jersey with 27:04.

Video: BOS@NJD: McAvoy dangles for SO winner in 11th round

Homecoming for Sullivan

Long before he was the coach of the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions, Mike Sullivan was a Massachusetts native coaching the Bruins, the team he grew up watching. The Bruins hired Sullivan, who had coached their American Hockey League affiliate in Providence, as coach in 2003 and finished first in the Northeast Division in 2003-04. But Boston lost in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and after the Bruins failed to make the playoffs in 2005-06, he was fired. Sullivan went more than nine seasons between NHL coaching jobs, but after being promoted to the top spot by the Penguins on Dec. 12, 2015, after Mike Johnson was fired, he's led the Penguins to consecutive championships. However, he has yet to coach them to victory in three tries in the building he used to call home.","boston video bufpit crosby nets

Bobby Orr and Mario Lemieux are two of the best hockey players of all time, but only one of them can own the Greatest NHL Moment .

Orr's iconic overtime goal that won the Stanley Cup on May 10, 1970, is up against Lemieux scoring five goals in five different ways on Dec. 31, 1988.

The original bracket of 64 moments was determined by a blue-ribbon panel consisting of broadcasters from NHL national rightsholders NBC Sports Group, NHL Network, Sportsnet and TVA Sports. Five weeks of fan voting has cut the field to two.

Lemieux reached the final round by defeating Wayne Gretzky scoring 50 goals in the first 39 games of the 1980-81 season in one semifinal. His road to the final also included defeating the Stastny brothers each scoring eight points in a game in the first round, Gretzky scoring his NHL-record 802nd goal in the second round, the New York Islanders winning their fourth straight Stanley Cup championship in the third round and Darryl Sittler's 10-point game in the fourth round.

Video: Greatest NHL Moments: Lemieux vs. Orr

Orr defeated Teemu Selanne breaking the rookie single-season goal-scoring record in 1992-93 in the semifinal round. His road to the final included defeating Mud Bruneteau's winning goal in the sixth overtime of a 1936 playoff game in the first round, Steve Yzerman's double-overtime goal in Game 7 of the 1996 Western Conference Final in the second round, Joe Sakic handing the Stanley Cup to Ray Bourque after the Colorado Avalanche's Game 7 victory in 2001 in the third round and Gordie Howe becoming the first NHL player with 1,000 points in the fourth round.

To vote on the final matchup, fans can visit NHL.com/GreatestMoments. They can join the conversation using the hashtag #NHLGreatestMoments. Final-round voting ends on Nov. 29. The fans' choice for the Greatest NHL Moment will be announced during the 2017 Scotiabank NHL100 Classic between the Montreal Canadiens and Ottawa Senators at Lansdowne Park in Ottawa on Dec. 16 (7 p.m. ET; NBCSN, CBC, TVA Sports, NHL.TV).","steve yzermans doubleovertime

From there it spread, into the United States and elsewhere, into a passion that would eventually become a league, and then an obsession.

From there it spread, into the United States and elsewhere, into a passion that would eventually become a league, and then an obsession. It would bind grandparents and parents and children, friends and enemies, cities and nations.

""Think of it, more than anything else, as a connector of generations,"" said Emmy Award-winning actor Jon Hamm, narrator of ""The NHL: 100,"" a documentary debuting this week.

The idea was both simple and not-so-simple. To compress 100 years of NHL history -- the highs and lows, the dynasties and superstars -- into two hours of film, a documentary that takes viewers from the humble beginnings of the NHL to the robust 31-team League it is today.

[RELATED: Complete NHL Centennial coverage]

Steve Mayer, the NHL's chief content officer, and Ross Greenburg, the film's producer, have done that, exploring some of the League's little-known early stories as well as its most well-loved moments, moving era by era through hockey history.

""It's a daunting task to be in the mix of doing the definitive sweeping documentary on the history of the League,"" Greenburg said. ""It's a pretty stiff challenge and it's a little bit awesome in its scope.""

The final product, which can be viewed as four stand-alone, 25-minute episodes or a two-hour documentary, is split by 25-year periods, from the League's Founding Years to the Original Six to the Expansion Era to the Global Game of today, and is set to premiere in Canada on Thursday (7 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET; SN) and air in the United States on Sunday (10 p.m. ET; NBCSN, NHLN). NHL Network will rebroadcast the documentary on Saturday, Dec. 2, at 1 p.m. ET and Sunday, Dec. 3, at 4 p.m. ET.

Video: The NHL: 100 Years celebrates a century of hockey

Beginning Monday, fans worldwide will be able to watch the documentary online. And for the first time ever, the League is making videos available to fans on its Facebook Watch page - a new video-first format on Facebook that focuses on thematically-related, episodic content. The first video to be featured is the documentary, which fans can live stream on their home or mobile devices.

The piece is filled with interviews with stars, from Ted Lindsay to Wayne Gretzky to Patrick Kane, and historians, including former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper. It is filled with highlights and clips, videos of game film and historic photos.

""It's an emotional piece,"" Greenburg said. ""I found myself getting a tear in my eye or a tingle up my spine when we would introduce the great ones like [Guy] Lafleur or [Gordie] Howe or [Bobby] Orr or some of the other contemporaries like Wayne Gretzky.

""You see your life passing by during a documentary like this. That's what you really want people to feel. I remember where I was when Bobby Orr went flying through the air. That's important to give people that memory back.""

But it's not just emotional. It's not just about moments already experienced. The documentary delves, especially in the first section, into history that might not be known to the average fan.

""There are a lot of little stories that a lot of people probably don't remember or never knew, even hardcore fans,"" Greenburg said. ""People [might] have very little knowledge of how it all started, who the first stars were and how it evolved -- even the introduction of the sport to the United States, people take for granted.

""So those kinds of stories are the fun finds for us. That's what we enjoy putting into these [documentaries] so people can learn, as much as they can feel the 100-year history.""

As Mayer added, ""That was a goal. We wanted to have takeaways from the documentary that even the most avid fan would go, 'I did not know that'.""

The documentary is the finishing piece to a celebration of the NHL's Centennial that runs from January through December 2017, and is the second major documentary the League has released this season, after ""Names on the Cup,"" which was released during the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

""Ultimately this is the coup de grace, the 100-year documentary, something that will encompass all [the history],"" Mayer said. ""It's very difficult to tell the story of 100 years in two hours, but I think we captured the essence of what this league is all about and how it's grown and all the various steps to that growth. We're super-excited for the fans to see this and [to see] their reaction.""

And it is in watching it that this quote from Hamm rings true, ""It's then you'll understand just why the National Hockey League has meant so much to so many.""

But this, of course, is just about the first 100 years of the NHL. The next 100 starts in 2018 and, as the filmmakers and the NHL's executives and its fans realize, there is so much more to come. More history. More stars. More moments.

As Commissioner Gary Bettman says, at the end, ""I and so many others are happy to celebrate the first 100 years, but we're even more excited about beginning the second 100 years.""","documentary

Instead he opted to pass to defenseman Christopher Tanev.

One of the most telling moments of Brock Boeser's first quarter of the season came in the final minute against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Nov. 4.

The Chris-first, not me-first moment, was one of those acts with a lingering impact. Tanev didn't score, but that wasn't the point.

""I could have shot,"" Boeser said a few days later. ""I could have passed. But our [defense] had a ton of chances that game, so I saw that he had a better chance of scoring from there. That's what went through my head.""

Boeser had his first NHL hat trick and an assist in the Canucks' 4-2 win against the Penguins, and he hasn't slowed down. The 20-year-old scored twice Tuesday in a 5-2 win at the Philadelphia Flyers and had two goals Wednesday in a 5-2 victory at Pittsburgh to take the NHL rookie scoring lead. He has seven points (six goals, one assist) in his past five games.

Scoring goals attracts notice, but humility builds currency in the dressing room.

Video: VAN@PIT: Boeser rips one-timer past Murray for PPG

""There's something about being humble,"" Canucks coach Travis Green said. ""There's just something about making sure that you don't get ahead of yourself. Not only do people recognize that, but more importantly, your teammates recognize that.""

Boeser leads NHL rookies in scoring with 21 points (11 goals, 10 assists) in 19 games; he's one point ahead of forwards Clayton Keller of the Arizona Coyotes and Mathew Barzal of the New York Islanders. Boeser and Keller are the only rookies leading their teams in scoring.

Boeser's breakout talent and quick release have been on full display in Vancouver but were developed and nurtured in his hometown of Burnsville, Minnesota, against a backdrop of personal challenges.

When Boeser was in high school, one of his closest friends died and another was permanently disabled in an automobile accident in 2014. His father, Duke, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2010, suffered serious injuries in a car accident in 2012 and had treatment and surgery for lung cancer earlier this year.

Boeser's most recent accomplishments couldn't have come at a better time for the family. Laurie Boeser, his mother, said her husband will have another scan in December to reconfirm that the cancer is gone.

""This is very good medicine,"" she said in a telephone interview from Minnesota. ""Not only for my husband, but for all of us. We love this. This is amazing. It gives us something to look forward to, and he and Brock FaceTime on the phone. I'm more the go-to person for the to-dos. I'm still mom.""

Video: VAN@PIT: Boeser rips home 10th goal while falling

Boeser played the final nine games of the 2016-17 season with Vancouver, joining the Canucks the day after his season at the University of North Dakota ended. As luck would have it, he made his NHL debut against the Minnesota Wild in St. Paul.

The Canucks asked Boeser's parents to read their starting lineup in the dressing room.

""It was a special moment when they got to come in there,"" Boeser said. ""I kind of got emotional. I can't thank them for enough for what they did. My eyes started getting watery and stuff. I had to refocus.""

Laurie called it a ""once-in-a-lifetime experience.

""He was very reluctant but they convinced him,"" she said of her husband. ""And I said, 'I'll be right next to you.' The next thing we're in there and I thought 'If I look at Brock, I'm just going to fall apart.' My husband was so focused on what he had to read.

""When I finally looked over at Brock -- the red cheeks and the big tears in his eyes. It was amazing. What a rare opportunity. You get to play your first home game in your hometown, and he scored right in front of our suite.""

Video: Exclusive look at Boeser's first day with the Canucks

Five points (four goals, one assist) in nine games gave Canucks fans a glimpse of Boeser's talent. But an offseason coaching change -- Green replaced Willie Desjardins -- meant he faced different challenges this season.

Green said Boeser looked tired by the end of training camp. He was a healthy scratch in the first two games of the season and also missed an Oct. 30 game against the Dallas Stars because of a foot contusion.

""We had a hard training camp,"" the first-year coach said. ""We had an open dialogue with him. He was a little tired, and that happens with the pace as training camp goes on.

""Give Brock credit. He pushed himself, got his legs back under him and has played well ever since then.""

Brad Berry, Boeser's coach at North Dakota, has approved of the way the Canucks handled his former player. Boeser played two seasons at North Dakota, winning the NCAA championship in 2015-16, his freshman season.

""They did it the right way,"" Berry said. ""They didn't rush him into games or situations. They made him earn it. That's what we do here at North Dakota. That was a great step by Vancouver.""

Video: The guys on Boeser's scoring, leadership for Canucks

Boeser had points in his first four games this season and quickly developed chemistry with linemates Bo Horvat and Sven Baertschi.

""To me, it's kind of a new-age line,"" TSN analyst Ray Ferraro said. ""Five or seven years ago, you might have needed a big power forward on that line. I don't see that anymore.

""That's a trio that can and should work well. Horvat is strong and he can skate. Baertschi moves the puck well. Then you have your trigger guy and that's Boeser.""

Green feels Boeser has plenty of upside.

""He's got a good head on his shoulders,"" he said. ""It's not like we're seeing the best Brock Boeser that we're going to see.

""I don't know any player that's come into the League and played 10 games and he's at his best, from the best players in the world. That just doesn't happen. You look at Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid … they didn't just come in the league and be the best players.

Weekes also will assist fans with three must-watch elements of the game.

With the holiday behind them, it's back to business for the Penguins and Bruins, with each team looking to bolster its standing in the Eastern Conference and its respective division.

The Penguins (11-9-3) play the Bruins (9-7-4) at TD Garden in the Discover NHL Thanksgiving Showdown (1 p.m. ET; NBC, NHL.TV). Here's my breakdown of the game:

Penguins

Pluses: Phil Kessel leads the Penguins in scoring with 26 points (eight goals, 18 assists). I know there are times he plays with Evgeni Malkin, but those numbers aren't bad for a guy who's been a third-line player for most of his time in Pittsburgh. Kessel is such a versatile piece. He is one of the rare players who can beat goalies from distance with his shot, and his passing is probably as lethal if not more so than his ability to finish.

For the most part, Matt Murray (11-6-1) has been really good. He has played a ton of hockey during the past two seasons, and while he hasn't been at his best this season, he's still been the horse for them and been good. The Penguins lost Marc-Andre Fleury to the Vegas Golden Knights during the offseason, but I spoke to Pittsburgh goalie coach Mike Buckley earlier in the season and he said Murray has been putting more work into the new role of being a No. 1 starter.

Most of their stars are healthy, especially Sidney Crosby. That's something that they're not used to.

Minuses: The long playoff runs are what you want as a team, but not getting a lot of rest can wear on you. Pittsburgh played 107 games last season and 106 in 2015-16. That doesn't count the World Cup of Hockey 2016, in which a handful of Pittsburgh's top players took part. All that hockey is definitely draining and perhaps it's showing so far this season; the Penguins have 11 wins in 23 games.

Pittsburgh has been inconsistent this season. They also play on Saturday, the second game of a back-to-back. The Penguins are 0-4-2 in the second game of back-to-backs and have been outscored 35-12. The 19 back-to-backs are tied with the Ottawa Senators for the most in the League.

Bruins

Pluses: On Feb. 11 last season, Boston's backup goaltenders were 1-10-2. This season has been vastly different: Anton Khudobin is 6-0-2 with a 2.13 goals-against average and a .938 save percentage. He's started and won Boston's past three games. Khudobin made 40 saves on Wednesday in a 3-2, 11-round shootout win at the New Jersey Devils. It's been a long time since they've had that kind of backup goaltending behind Tuukka Rask, who has struggled this season.

The Bruins have been getting meaningful contributions from young players like forwards Danton Heinen, Anders Bjork and Jake DeBrusk and defenseman Charlie McAvoy and Brandon Carlo. There are jobs to be had right now. Unfortunately, that's because of injury, but very few times are this many jobs available for young guys on the same team.

The Bruins have been without forwards David Krejci, Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron, defenseman Torey Krug and Rask at different times this season, but they've managed to find a way to stay in the Stanley Cup Playoff race. They're one point behind the Detroit Red Wings for third place in the Atlantic Division.

Video: BOS@NJD: Khudobin snags Butcher's shot in SO

Minuses: Although the Bruins have managed to hang in despite all the injuries, it's been hard because some of those guys are key players on the team. Marchand has 15 points in 14 games, which is second on the Bruins, but has missed four straight games with an undisclosed injury. Bergeron (five goals, 13 points in 15 games) missed the first five games of the season. Rask, who won the Vezina Trophy in 2014, missed time with a concussion and has been struggling (3-7-2, 2.89 GAA, .897 save percentage) but I'm confident that he will get his game back.

Sometimes with the relative inexperience, you have to learn to live with mistakes and learn to be patient. It hasn't been a complete rebuild for the Bruins, who have missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs two of the past three seasons. It's good to know that guys they've had in Providence in the American Hockey League are coming up and making an impact for the Bruins and are showing they have the skills to play.

Three things to watch

1. Who starts in goal for the Bruins?

2. Who will defend against Crosby?

3. How will the young kids do for the Bruins?","david krejci brad marchand patrice bergeron

Tom Gulitti,"WASHINGTON -- It was almost as if Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom had never been apart.Back on the same line, they teamed to produce a big goal in the Washington Capitals' 5-2 victory against the Ottawa Senators at Capital One Arena on Wednesday.",2017-11-23T15:37:40Z,nhl-news,Reunion shows Ovechkin-Backstrom shows chemistry still exists,https://www.nhl.com/news/reunion-shows-alex-ovechkin-nick-backstrom-shows-chemistry-still-exists/c-293295422,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293295548/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Back on the same line, they teamed to produce a big goal in the Washington Capitals' 5-2 victory against the Ottawa Senators at Capital One Arena on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON -- It was almost as if Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom had never been apart.

That's how it's worked for much of the past 11 seasons. Backstrom, the playmaking center, makes the slick passes. Ovechkin, the left wing and dominant goal-scorer of his generation, puts a lot of them in the net.

It's been a mutually beneficial relationship that's helped the Capitals win a lot of games.

Ovechkin's breakaway goal Wednesday, which increased the Capitals' lead to 2-0 with five seconds left in the first period, was the 572nd of his career. It was the 218th time Backstrom assisted on an Ovechkin goal, 38.1 percent of Ovechkin's career total.

""We understand each other, how we have to play,"" Ovechkin said. ""Obviously, we played [together] a long time. So I think it worked out perfectly.""

But before Wednesday, Ovechkin and Backstrom had played on the same line for only a handful of shifts this season.

Their separation began during the Stanley Cup Playoffs last season when coach Barry Trotz thought it would help Backstrom and right wing T.J. Oshie to play with a faster left wing. Ovechkin was playing through knee and hamstring injuries at the time and, with age, (he turned 32 on Sept. 17), he'd lost a half a step.

So Trotz moved speedy 22-year-old Andre Burakovsky into Ovechkin's spot. It worked well enough that Burakovsky remained with Backstrom and Oshie to begin this season.

Video: OTT@WSH: Ovechkin goes bar down on speedy rush

Ovechkin, who reported for training camp in prime condition and appears to have regained some of his lost power and speed, began the season on a line with center Evgeny Kuznetsov and rookie Jakub Vrana. That worked well initially, with Ovechkin scoring seven goals in the first two games and nine in the first five.

Backstrom also started well, piling up 12 points (three goals, nine assists) in his first eight games. But that early success fizzled out around the time Burakovsky fractured his left thumb against the Florida Panthers on Oct. 21.

While Burakovsky has been out, Backstrom has struggled, particularly at even strength. Before Wednesday, the 29-year-old had no goals and four assists (two at even strength) in 15 games. With various left wings auditioning on the line, Oshie's even-strength production faded, too.

Oshie has a team-high seven power-play goals, but had one goal and four assists at even strength in 17 games heading into Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Ovechkin's line with Kuznetsov and, most recently, Devante Smith-Pelly hadn't produced an even-strength point in six games; Ovechkin hadn't scored a goal of any kind during that stretch.

Despite their scoring struggles, the Capitals began November with five wins in six games. But they followed that surge with three losses in four games while scoring just five even-strength goals. With the Capitals falling to 11-10-1 for the season, it was clear Trotz needed to change something.

""It wasn't working the way we played,"" Backstrom said.

Reuniting Backstrom and Ovechkin seemed the obvious move, but Trotz resisted -- at least publicly.

When asked Tuesday why he hadn't put Backstrom and Ovechkin back together, Trotz coyly answered, ""Don't feel like it."" Trotz admitted Wednesday that he'd been thinking about doing it for a while and discussed the move with the coaching staff Tuesday.

""[The media] were sort of quizzing me, and I was trying to avoid everything,"" Trotz said.

When Backstrom and Ovechkin arrived at the Capitals' practice rink Wednesday morning, they learned they'd be playing together on a line with Tom Wilson as their right wing. Neither had questioned why Trotz hadn't put them back together previously, but neither seemed surprised when it finally happened in the season's 23rd game.

Video: WSH@NJD: Backstrom, Ovechkin combine for PPG

""It's all up to the coaching staff,"" Backstrom said. ""I don't know. Sometimes you switch it up.""

As with any relationship that's lasted for more than a decade, Backstrom and Ovechkin have no doubt gone through their share of rough patches. But their on-ice chemistry has always been there.

By the end of the first period, Ovechkin's goal drought was over and Backstrom had his third even-strength point (all assists) since Oct. 20.

Backstrom's pass to Alex Chiasson on the right wing started the breakout. Chiasson then fed Ovechkin, who gained a step on Senators defenseman Cody Ceci on the left side. Ovechkin raced in on Craig Anderson and lifted the puck in over the Ottawa goaltender's right shoulder for his 14th goal of the season.

""I was afraid time was running [out],"" Ovechkin said. ""So I just tried to shoot it as best, as fast as I can and luck was on my side.""

Trotz's other changes worked, too. Vrana, who skated at left wing on the second line with Kuznetsov and Oshie, had the first two-goal game of his career. Kuznetsov scored a power-play goal and had two assists. Oshie had two assists.

But seeing Ovechkin and Backstrom back together was a reminder of the special connection between them. It's existed pretty much from the moment then-general manager George McPhee had Ovechkin announce the Capitals' selection of Backstrom with the No. 4 pick in the 2006 NHL Draft in Vancouver.

""It's just like anything,"" Trotz said. ""It doesn't have to be forever, but they do have a special, unique chemistry.""

There have been other times Trotz has split up Ovechkin and Backstrom, but they've always ended up back together. How long this reunion lasts remains to be seen, but Trotz said they'd probably remain together for the Capitals' home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Friday (5 p.m. ET; NHL Network, NBCSWA, SUN, NHL.TV)

""The line that is used [is] if you love something, you set it free,"" Trotz said. ""If it comes back, it was meant to be.""","the

Derek Robertson,"The Turks thought the president would be their friend. Instead, ties with Washington have only gotten worse.",2017-11-23T12:35:00Z,politico,How Trump Burned Turkey,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/23/how-trump-burned-turkey-215859,https://static.politico.com/a2/81/65be85614ceab9d488aa0925ed78/171122-trump-erogan.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Every year, the day before Thanksgiving, the fire department in the Washington, D.C., suburb where I live posts a “Keep Your Family Safe this Thanksgiving” bulletin on its website, offering tips about how to avoid injury during the holiday. It being Thanksgiving, most of the advice is geared toward kitchen safety—like don’t pour water or grease on a cooktop fire, and make sure your sleeves are rolled up so they don’t get caught in a stovetop flame. In addition to these appeals to common sense, Montgomery County, Maryland, fire officials devote a special section of their post just for deep frying turkey. This increasingly popular practice, the firefighters warn, is “extremely hazardous if proper precautions are not taken.”

What can be said about the bird called turkey is also true of the country with the same name. Through a toxic brew of conspiracy mongering, thuggery and rage—at Kurds, the European Union, the United States and others—Turkish political leaders have seemingly fried the brains of pro-government journalists, editors, academics, diplomats and average Turks, and crippled their capacity to reason. Since the failed coup d’etat attempt in Turkey last year, many of these people, whether out of true belief or in the service of self-preservation, have ceaselessly repeated the conspiracies propagated by the Turkish government, sowing an atmosphere of fear and paranoia in Turkey. At the center of this is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who—unlike Uncle Earl on the back porch hoping to avoid cataclysmic poultry ignition—seems to benefit from a country on the verge of explosion.

Story Continued Below

The United States figures prominently in Turkey’s panicked discourse. The Turks had high hopes for Donald Trump’s presidency, given his hostility to an American “establishment” that Ankara regards as irredeemably hostile to Turkey, and his almost automatic rejection of the policies of his predecessor. There was also hope among Turkish officials that Trump would be more sympathetic to their vilification of the cleric Fethullah Gulen—Turkey’s public enemy No. 1—who lives in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania and whom the Turks badly want extradited; Trump’s first national security adviser Michael Flynn was cozy with the Turks and even allegedly discussed a plan last December to help them remove Gulen (though his lawyer denies this). But this optimism seems to have been misplaced: The Trump White House has not deviated from its predecessor’s refusal to send Gulen back to Turkey without adhering to a formal extradition process, or other Obama-era policies toward Turkey. In fact, since Trump took office, conspiracy theories involving prominent Americans are only intensifying in Turkey, making an already explosive situation there—and U.S.-Turkey relations generally—all the more combustible.

Erdogan has pursued a policy of polarization for the past decade, delegitimizing his critics, jailing journalists, packing the courts with supporters and reversing his promise to peacefully resolve the “Kurdish question,” concerning the rights, cultural claims and political status of 20 percent of the population that is not ethnically Turkish. But only recently has the combination of Erdogan’s populism and personal political needs produced an all-out reign of terror. Since the failed coup in July 2016, more than 200,000 people have been jailed, detained or fired from their jobs. This purge, the roots of which can be traced back to early 2014, ostensibly targets followers of Gulen, whom the Turkish government alleges to be behind the coup. But just about anyone risks being tarnished by Erdogan’s government for allegedly being a “Gulenist,” which can be defined as anything from having written a single column in a Gulen-affiliated newspaper to being an active supporter, financially or otherwise, of the Gulen movement, which runs private schools and business and media networks that propagate Gulen’s spiritual message.

Turks have suffered the most, but the melting of the Turkish mind has also touched Americans. Not long after the attempted coup, the pro-Erdogan press accused General Joseph Votel—the commander of J.S. Central Command—and other U.S. officials of being part of the plot. According to the Turkish news media, central to the conspiracy was professor Henri J. Barkey of Lehigh University, a veteran of the Clinton administration’s State Department policy planning staff. A variety of Turkey’s leading Islamist, anti-Semitic and nationalist newspapers have charged in one sensational, fact-challenged article after another that Barkey orchestrated the coup from Buyukada—an island in the Sea of Marmara. In the reality-based community, Barkey was on the island at the time of the attempted coup to convene an academic conference about the Middle East and Iran one year after the Iran nuclear deal. The only thing he was capable of orchestrating that night, he has told me, was a good bottle of wine and an interesting discussion about Turkish politics. Evidence and reason do not matter in Erdogan’s addled Turkey, however. The Turkish press reported two weeks ago that prosecutors had issued a warrant for Barkey’s arrest, though as long as he remains in the United States, he is not in jeopardy.

Then there is the case involving Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Richard Berman, a federal district court judge—all of whom Turkish authorities have claimed, implausibly, to be supporters of Gulen.

Bharara is responsible for bringing federal charges against an Iranian-Turkish businessman named Reza Zarrab for allegedly evading sanctions against Iran. Given Zarrab’s connections to senior members of the government in Turkey, this, in and of itself, is reason to arouse official Turkish ire toward Bharara. But the fact that Bharara also previously worked for Schumer, as his chief counsel, is, for Erdogan’s ludicrous mouthpieces like Sabah and its English version, Daily Sabah, irrefutable evidence of a tainted, Gulen-inspired prosecution. Schumer, who broke bread with Erdogan at a private dinner that the late founder of Atlantic records, Ahmet Ertugun, hosted in the mid-2000s, gave a speech before the Gulen-affiliated Turkic American Alliance in March 2016, and Turkish media reports claim, without evidence, that he has received some donations from Gulenists (as many Turks believe about members of Congress generally). Meanwhile, the Turkish press claims that Berman, who is presiding over the Zarrab case, criticized the Turkish government’s attacks on judicial independence during a visit to the country a few years ago at the invitation of an allegedly Gulen-linked law firm.

Neither Schumer nor Berman has denied these claims, yet it is very possible that neither was aware that they were dealing with Gulenists, who tend to use innocuous sounding names for their organizations, like the Turkic American Alliance. I have little doubt that Gulen’s followers were trying to influence Schumer, Bharara and Berman, but neither is there evidence that they were successful. After all, it would hardly be necessary for a Gulenist to whisper in Berman’s ear that Erdogan was engaged in an assault on Turkey’s judiciary; it is plain to anyone with even a passing interest in Turkey, and it is hardly out of the norm for a judge to comment on the issue. Likewise, it is absurd to believe that Bharara pursued charges against Zarrab because he was under a Gulenist spell; Zarrab, Bharara argued, was breaking the law with the help of Turkish officials. This does not matter for Turkish officialdom, which has created an environment where its supporters see Gulenist conspiracies everywhere. As Zarrab's trial approaches—it is scheduled to begin on November 27—Turkey’s foreign minister last week declared, apparently in an effort to insulate Erdogan and the Turkish government from any fallout from the trial, that Gulen’s network had infiltrated the American political system. In response, Bharara called Turkey’s chief diplomat a “liar.”

Amid all this, it seems that every week someone declares that U.S.-Turkey relations have reached an unprecedented nadir. There has been trouble as long as the relationship has existed, at times even reaching what some might call a “crisis.” Still, it is hard to remember a time when there was so much distrust and outright animosity between Washington and Ankara. In October, after the arrest of a U.S. consulate employee in Istanbul, the United States went so far as to stop processing nonimmigrant visas for Turks, which prompted the Turkish government to do the same to Americans seeking to visit Turkey. Officials in Ankara had high hopes for Trump because he promised to undo whatever Barack Obama had done, and the Turks figured that included Turkey policy. But from their perspective, Trump has proved no better than his predecessor, whom Erdogan came to loathe.

Like Owen Wilson’s character in the animated film Free Birds, who obliges viewers to see Thanksgiving from the perspective of the poor turkey, Turkey the country has legitimate grievances against Washington. In 2003, the Turks watched as an American president ordered—against their advice—the invasion of Iraq. As that country destabilized, Turkey experienced a wave of attacks originating from Iraq by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a terrorist group that has waged war on the Turks since the mid-1980s. Then, the Turks watched in horror as Obama decided not to act in the Middle East while Syria’s uprising became a vortex of violence that forced Turkey to accept millions of refugees and destabilized its southeastern border. The fragmentation of Syria and the rise of the Islamic State led to what Ankara sees as Washington’s ultimate betrayal: a U.S. military relationship with a Syrian-Kurdish fighting force called the People’s Protection Units (known by its acronym, YPG), which was set up by, and is inextricably linked to, the PKK. It is true that the Turks were ambivalent, at best, about fighting the Islamic State, but the hypocrisy of America’s post-9/11 declaration of “you are either with us or against us” is too much for Turks to take.

The U.S. policy of working with the YPG began under Obama, but it has continued with Trump. The Turks have failed to come to any agreement with the Trump administration about their views of the Zarrab case or Gulen’s extradition, both of which are in the hands of the U.S. courts. Trump also signed off on the State Department’s recommendation to stop processing visas for Turks. And while Erdogan claimed that Trump apologized to him after the Turkish president’s bodyguards and supporters violently attacked protesters in Washington this spring, the White House said, “There was no apology.” Even after meetings between Trump and Erdogan in May and September, and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim’s meeting in Washington this month with Vice President Mike Pence, the Turks have come away empty-handed: The U.S. will continue to arm the YPG, Gulen will remain in the United States until a court determines there is evidence for extradition, and the Zarrab case will not go away.

In all these instances, one could say that Trump burned Turkey. Yet the legitimacy of these complaints is diminished when the Turkish government seems to believe there is a Gulenist under every couch in Washington. After all, with few exceptions—mostly those in Ankara’s pay—people in Washington who deal with Turkey regard it as a country whose elites have basically gone mad.

Is there a way out for U.S.-Turkey relations? Only if one believes the myths of a bygone era, when Turks and Americans stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the Korea conflict and during the Cold War. That was a long time ago, though. Today, the United States and Turkey share neither values nor interests. The bilateral relationship is more like what many Americans will find in the fridge this Sunday night: a picked-over carcass, cold remnants of stuffing, a slice or two of droopy pumpkin pie and a few forlorn sweet potatoes. It is all rather unappealing after living off that stuff for the previous three days, forcing Americans to find something other than leftover Turkey—fried or not—for sustenance.

CBS News is increasing training. NBC News is looking at all of the above.

They, like other major media outlets, including POLITICO, are grappling with how to better communicate and reach out to employees as the news business faces a wave of revelations of inappropriate behavior.

Story Continued Below

By Wednesday, two of the three major broadcast networks, the leading cable network, the second-leading cable network, the top public-radio network, and the nation’s most prestigious newspaper have all confronted the same problem: A prominent figure accused of behaving inappropriately.

In the wake of ""CBS Morning"" host Charlie Rose’s firing and New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush’s suspension this week, many news organizations were trying to figure out how better to handle workplace problems in the future. For the most part, news organizations fell back on reminding their employees about their current policies and resources.

“We have robust policies in place and have become more focused on communicating those policies across the organization,” said New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha in an email. “In recent weeks, we've reminded employees of our Anti-Harassment, Equal Employment Opportunity, and Non-Discrimination policies and we've highlighted the many ways an employee can raise an issue or file a complaint, including through an anonymous hotline.”

In a memo to employees announcing Rose’s firing on Tuesday, CBS News President David Rhodes said that he was “deeply disappointed and angry that people were victimized” and added, “We will have human resources support today and every day, and we are organizing more personal and direct training which you will hear about from senior management shortly.”

MSNBC has seen two contributors — reporters Mark Halperin and Thrush — caught up in scandal. The cable network did not provide comment, but a source at NBC News said that the company was working off a similar playbook: Leaders in the news division have reminded employees about the different ways they can report concerns about workplace conduct — alerting managers, HR, confidential tip lines, or an ombudsman — and sent reminders to employees with all the relevant contact information.

“It’s the first time we’ve seen the public display of news organizations and organizations writ large really grappling with this issue,” said Debbie Dougherty, a communications professor at the University of Missouri who specializes in sexual harassment.

Dougherty has researched sexual harassment policies and found that the typically cold, legalistic documents bear little resemblance to how employees experience these issues. Companies need to rethink their policies, she said, “or we’re just going to get a repeat.” They key, she said, is writing policies that connect with employees and help facilitate a broader cultural change in the workplace.

“I think they’re doing what is almost predictable,” she said. “They fired the perpetrator and they push out their policy and say, ‘Look everybody, here’s a policy, why aren’t you following it?’ That’s usually the first thing people do, they focus on those two things. And then they’re going to find that doesn’t resolve their situation and they’re going to hopefully start looking for broader answers.”

That means, she says, “Bringing in experts, listening to them, really grappling with this problem, thinking hard about it differently. I know these sound sort of vague and fuzzy, but if you can’t think differently about this problem, it’s never going to go away.”

One outlet has been confronting this problem for more than a year: Fox News, which lost its president, Roger Ailes, top-rated host, Bill O’Reilly, and another top host, Eric Bolling, all over sexual harassment allegations that weren’t initially revealed to the public, let alone discussed in the newsroom.

Reached for comment, Fox News pointed to the changes the network has made over the last year, including beefing up its HR staff with hires from outside the company — including a new head of the department — and adding mandatory sexual harassment training for all employees.

Though some executives closely tied to Ailes are no longer working at the network—former co-president Bill Shine left in May and executive vice president of legal and business affairs Dianne Brandi abruptly went on voluntary leave last month—the people currently in charge, including president of programming Suzanne Scott, president of news Jay Wallace and co-president Jack Abernethy, have been with Fox News for years and were also prominent parts of the Ailes regime. Even with new policies in place, it remains to be seen how much of a cultural shift takes hold at Rupert Murdoch’s network.

POLITICO has not been immune, either. Three of the four allegations against Thrush occurred while he was a POLITICO employee; the fourth came once he had left for the Times, but was attending another POLITICO staffer’s going-away party. After the news on Monday about Thrush, CEO Patrick Steel sent a staffwide email saying, “POLITICO is a place where you should feel supported in your work, respected as an individual, and able to achieve your professional goals …The notion that anyone at POLITICO would be subjected to harassment — or feel as though they couldn’t speak out — is totally unacceptable to me. Our standards and values leave no ambiguity — this behavior will not be tolerated, period.”

Like his colleagues at other outlets, Steel asked employees to review the company’s policies and procedures for harassment and professional conduct.

Jennifer Drobac, a professor at the McKinney School of Law at Indiana University and an expert on sexual harassment, said that recirculating policies is “a good first step,” but agreed that a broader cultural change is needed. She said adding an ombudsman is a good idea for companies, and that training for top executives is especially important.

“I actually think that just the message from key executives that they recognize that there’s been a cultural change and that they are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure a safe and respectful work environment, that message goes a long way, particularly when it’s followed up by concrete action when there’s a problem,” she said.

Drobac said she approved of CBS News’ handling of Rose.

“When Charlie Rose gets fired,” she said, “the company means business.”

DEREK ROBERTSON,"A new study finds that after last year’s scorched-earth presidential campaign, Americans could barely stand to look each other in the eye.",2017-11-23T12:37:00Z,politico,How Donald Trump Ruined Thanksgiving,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/23/how-donald-trump-ruined-thanksgiving-215862,https://static.politico.com/2d/1c/7cf287c64bffbe597523c0e9cf69/171121-trump-gty-1160.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"In the 10 months since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has been accused of torching everything from America’s stature on the global stage to the country’s most treasured political norms. He “ruined the eclipse,” noted one observer; he “ruined all my favorite TV shows,” lamented another. He’s been accused of destroying workplace morale, irony and Bachelor in Paradise, too.

It’s only natural: To be a leader is to accept your fair share of blame, and then some. No doubt Americans will spend the next four to eight years debating whether or not the president trashed U.S. foreign policy and reality TV and everything in between. But a new study by economists Keith Chen of UCLA and Ryne Rohla of Washington State University seems to have proved at least one point conclusively: Trump really did ruin Thanksgiving.

Story Continued Below

With the help of data-tracking service SafeGraph, Chen and Rohla traced the movements of more than 10 million Americans across the past two Thanksgiving holidays. They focused specifically on people who traveled from Republican-leaning areas to Democratic-leaning areas and vice versa, and found that politically divided families spent on average 20 to 30 minutes less time around the dinner table in 2016 than they did in 2015. That added up to a loss of 62 million person-hours of Thanksgiving time across the country—and specifically, the authors estimated, a loss of “27 million person-hours of cross-partisan Thanksgiving discourse.”

To conduct their study, Chen and Rohla first established the cellphone users’ “home” location by tracking where their phone was most frequently between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., then compared that with where they were between 1 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Using election records compiled down to the precinct level, Chen and Rohla narrowed the sample to cellphone users who traveled to areas politically opposed to their own, in both 2015 and 2016. They narrowed that further to subjects who were in their “home” district during both the morning and evening of Thanksgiving, and therefore likely had control over the duration of their visit. The results show that those subjects chose to spend significantly less time at Thanksgiving dinner in 2016 than in 2015. The effect more than doubled in areas that saw heavy political advertising, confirming that the shortened family time was thanks to politics, and wasn’t just due to a countrywide epidemic of poor cooking. Chen says he and Rohla collected over 40 billion location “pings” in November 2016, compared to a smaller but methodologically comparable sample in 2015, to build their map of our post-election dinner anxiety.

“It’s not shocking,” says urbanist and social geographer Joel Kotkin of the results of the study. “But it is kind of demoralizing.”

The “demoralizing” nature of last year’s election cycle might be the one thing on which partisans around the table can agree, and that’s not just on Trump—both candidates carried historic unfavorable ratings. Only one candidate, however, could inflame tensions on both sides by the sheer mention of his name alone. With emotions running the gamut from elation to dread in the first few weeks after his shocking victory, Trump seems to have given many people a reason to avoid breaking bread with their political opposites.

Journalist Alaina Boukedes is one of them. She calls Chicago, one of the country’s bluest cities, home, but she was raised in deep-red Alabama and returns there for Thanksgiving each year. For Boukedes and her sister—a bureaucrat at the Environmental Protection Agency—the election was deeply personal, with Trump specifically targeting each of their professions. And while it had never been unusual for them to find themselves at political loggerheads with their father, a staunch Republican army veteran, over Thanksgiving dinners in the past, Trump’s unique derision for their callings deepened what had previously been a navigable divide.

“It was strange to think that my dad prioritized certain things that I couldn’t fathom in the first place,” Boukedes says. And so, the sisters cut the post-turkey discourse short. “We knew any conversation we tried to have would hit a brick wall.”

John Jost, a political psychologist at New York University who studies the way politics interacts with and shapes the family dynamic, wasn’t surprised by Chen and Rohla’s research. In his own 2007 study, he found that families and close friends bond over shared politics, and that political differences can cause deep rifts. That was in the pre-2016 world we’ve left behind. Trump, with his heretical talk of travel bans and ditching trade deals, has blown up the political system we thought we knew, further deepening partisan divides and leaving even members of previously harmonious families eyeing one another warily for dissent.

Just ask Elizabeth Greenaway, a never-Trump Republican who served as a Ted Cruz delegate at last year’s Republican National Convention. At last year’s Thanksgiving dinner in Pennsylvania, her Trump-supporting relatives chided her for her inability to hold her nose and support the man who accused her preferred candidate’s father of aiding the JFK assassination, among other things.

“I voted third party, and other family members did as well,” Greenway says. “But the older generation voted for Trump because they felt like that was the only option—like if you vote third party, you’re throwing away your vote.”

“It would get heated when Trump said this or that and they thought he was on point, and then myself or a couple of other members of the family would roll their eyes,” Greenway says. “Eventually my immediate family would just sort of avoid it, then, because you know how the other one feels so it’s just like, why would we even go there?”

John Bullock, an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University, warns against drawing too-broad conclusions from Chen and Rohla’s study, noting that it compared an election year with a nonelection year. But he generally agrees that 2016 saw greater opportunities for apprehension and avoidance across the board.

“It’s very likely that in every presidential election year you’re going to see some of this—the question is how much more of it did you see in 2016? My speculative answer is that the 2016 election was worse,” Bullock says. “It wasn’t an entirely different beast, but there was far more partisan rancor and fear in 2016 than 2012 or 2008.” This Thanksgiving might test Americans nearly as much as the last. A Quinnipiac poll shows that 63 percent of voters hope to avoid talking politics this year, with 69 percent even asserting that the manner in which we do that has contributed to overt violence—an idea that, after this year’s incidents in Charlottesville, Virginia, and on other college campuses, may be less surprising than it once was.

Chen and Rohla’s study is pioneering in its quantitative approach—but Thanksgiving, with its blood-is-thicker-than-water family ethos, has long been fertile ground for artists and pundits to characterize the nation’s political mood. In 1869, on the eve of the 15th Amendment’s ratification, Thomas Nast in Harper’s Weekly drew “Uncle Sam’s Thanksgiving”—a table where immigrants from around the globe not only sat with Uncle Sam but also were served by him. Freedom from Want, Norman Rockwell’s enduring portrait of a smiling family and their Thanksgiving feast, was the artist’s vision of a bounteous postwar consensus. The world he imagined is hard to recognize today, with fear and anxiety repelling us from that dinner table.

Where fear and anxiety are rife, however, some see an unexpected opportunity to overcome it. Daniel Post Senning, the great-great-grandson of etiquette maven Emily Post and an authority on the subject in his own right, finds his services in predictably high demand every November. And after fielding calls in the wake of last year’s election that were more like those you’d find on a crisis hotline than questions about table manners, his advice for Thanksgiving this year goes beyond etiquette to something at the heart of both private and civic life—the ability to listen.

Post Senning, while acknowledging there are levels of vitriol to which no one can reasonably subject themselves—and that it’s important to set personal boundaries—counsels a sort of radical patience for those willing to join the fray this year.

“If you establish you’re a person of goodwill, that you’re respectful, considerate and honest, that you can hold a different opinion and accept [someone else’s], you’re more likely to build a bridge,” Post Senning says. “It’s been a year now since one of the most shocking elections of our lifetime—one that left people with, frankly, real trauma.”

“Maybe it’s time to start giving ourselves that challenge and see what we can do.”

President Donald Trump told reporters this week that he believes Congress should disclose the settlements. A handful of House members from both parties are calling on Republican leadership to do the same.

Story Continued Below

And Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) proposed legislation Wednesday that would mandate public disclosure of sexual harassment settlements — and ban Congress from footing the bill for such deals in the future. Within a few hours of introducing his bill, DeSantis had been contacted by several Republican and Democratic lawmakers asking to sign on.

""It's taxpayer dollars at issue; taxpayers have a right to know how their money is being spent,"" DeSantis said in an interview, adding that he doesn't understand ""why the taxpayer should ever be on the hook for private misconduct of a member. ... That should not be something the taxpayers are funding.""

The effort by DeSantis and other lawmakers has sparked an uncomfortable debate inside an institution known for protecting its own. As a national controversy over sexual misconduct by powerful men swirls, some lawmakers worry that the push for disclosure could unfairly unmask members of Congress who insist they've been wrongly accused.

Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) office and the House Administration Committee have not ruled out potential changes to the settlement reporting process as part of an ongoing review of the chamber's harassment policy. But there's strong, albeit quiet, resistance on Capitol Hill to disclosing the names of members who've reached settlements in the past.

Some lawmakers and aides worry that several sitting members of Congress are among those who've paid their accusers in recent years. Some of them say that settling a claim doesn't necessarily mean the member was guilty. There are times when it is preferable to settle than to engage in a prolonged legal battle, these people surmise.

Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) made that point on CNN on Tuesday night, arguing that settlements ""should be [made] public going forward"" — but not retroactively.

""You may very well have people who ... were innocent but who thought [they] better get a settlement than go through protracted litigation,"" Nadler said.

But others argue that the taxpayer money involved trumps the case for keeping settlements private.

""They've used our tax dollars to settle cases where they're being accused, at least, of violating laws they're enacting and expect others to live under,"" said Jenny Beth Martin of the Tea Party Patriots. Martin's group is one of several calling for disclosure of lawmaker names.

It's not just fiscal hawks calling for more transparency. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), a longtime sponsor of anti-sexual harassment legislation, has also urged leaders to release the names of lawmakers who've settled sexual harassment claims. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) agreed, telling MSNBC on Tuesday that ""any settlements should be made public.""

Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) told POLITICO on Wednesday that he's drafting a bill that would bar Congress from using taxpayer money for harassment settlements.

""There is no way that the taxpayer should be subsidizing predatory behavior. Period,"" said the freshman lawmaker, who sits on a House subcommittee that oversees lawmakers' office budgets.

The back-and-forth comes two days after BuzzFeed reported that Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the longest-serving House member, had used his office funds to settle a sexual harassment claim against him. In recent weeks, several publications including POLITICO have reported that current House rules enable the Office of Compliance, which handles employment disputes, to tap Treasury resources to pay settlements for disputes brought to them.

Aides to Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have noted that the leaders don't currently have the names of the members who've settled such complaints, even if they wanted to release them.

But congressional leaders could likely get them if they asked. That's because the chairman and ranking member of the House Administration Committee, who have to approve any settlement payments issued by the Office of Compliance, would be expected to comply with any shift in policy agreed to by Ryan and Pelosi.

Since 1997, the compliance office has paid out $17 million in workplace dispute settlements, a total that covers discrimination, workplace safety, and pay claims, as well as harassment cases.

There's another potential wrinkle to releasing names and details of all harassment settlements: The compliance office does not necessarily keep records of harassment settlements that are paid out of members' office budgets, sources familiar with the process told POLITICO. That approach, which was used by Conyers, ostensibly allows members to avoid getting House Administration Committee approval.

""Based on my experience, that ends up being the approach that is most feasible,"" said a source familiar with the compliance office's confidential process, and who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly. But, the source added, members who use internal budgets to settle claims risk looking like they are ""getting around"" a requirement to pay claims from the compliance office's fund.

DeSantis said that using office budgets to pay for settlements may be one loophole that allows lawmakers to hide harassment claims even now. He wasn't sure if it is possible to force members to ""self-disclose"" whether they used their member office budgets to settle with accusers — though he encouraged reporters to try to identify any lawmakers who have done so.

DeSantis' bill would require all compliance office settlements to be made public as well as the details of the allegations. Victims' names would be kept secret, but DeSantis believes they should have a right to come forward to tell their stories.

His legislation, like the bill Taylor is working on, would also prohibit taxpayer money from being used to settle sexual harassment claims against lawmakers in the future. It would force any members involved in such payouts in the past to reimburse the Treasury for the payment, a requirement that's also included in broader legislation authored by Speier and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).

Though Taylor's legislation wouldn't require accused lawmakers involved in settlements to be named, the Republican said he would back DeSantis' measure, which does have that provision.

If Republican leaders don't lean on the House Administration Committee to disclose settlements, they may have to deal with external pressure from outside conservative groups that are ramping up the pressure on Congress to disclose more information.

Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that has used the Freedom of Information Act to uncover details of Hillary Clinton's emails, wants Congress to allow FOIA to apply to internal information such as the now-secret workplace misconduct settlements.

Currently FOIA does not apply to Congress, which for years has been shielded from document requests because lawmakers argue it would disrupt legislative deliberations.

""The fact is, we don't know what's going on on Capitol Hill because members of Congress want it that way,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said of the harassment settlements in a Tuesday video that the group posted on Twitter. ""And the only way that's going to change is if the American people react.""","the

Joe Barton was responding to a report in the Washington Post. Barton: Capitol Police investigating possible crime against me

Texas Rep. Joe Barton, having already apologized over a nude picture of him circulating online, said later Wednesday that the Capitol Police is investigating a potential crime against him involving explicit materials.

“Today, the Capitol Police reached out to me and offered to launch an investigation and I have accepted,"" the longtime Republican congressman said in a statement later Wednesday.

Story Continued Below

Barton's statement followed a report in the Washington Post. A woman told the Post she had a recording of a 2015 conversation in which he threatened to report her to the Capitol Police to protect himself after their relationship had ended. She also told the newspaper that she had received explicit material from the congressman during a relationship that lasted several years.

In the Post article, Barton is quoted as saying to her: ""I will be completely straight with you. I am ready if I have to, I don’t want to, but I should take all this crap to the Capitol Hill Police and have them launch an investigation.""

The Post said the woman spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In response, Barton said: ""The Dallas Morning News has identified a potential crime against me and the transcript referenced in the Washington Post may be evidence.""

He also reiterated that the relationship was ""consensual,"" and that when it came to an end, ""she threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation."" His statement concluded: ""Because of the pending investigation, we will have no further comment.""

Earlier in the day, Barton had apologized to his constituents over the explicit photo of him circulating online.

“While separated from my second wife, prior to the divorce, I had sexual relationships with other mature adult women,” Barton said in a statement first reported by the Texas Tribune. “Each was consensual. Those relationships have ended. I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down.”

The 68-year-old Barton has represented the Dallas area in the House since 1985. He is a former chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee.","powerful energy and commerce committee

That was the White House’s message on Wednesday after President Donald Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago, his palatial private club in Florida, to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with his family.

Story Continued Below

Trump and his aides insisted that the president would use his time at what they’ve dubbed the “Winter White House” to make progress on tax reform and other top priorities, even as he spent much of his first day back in Florida since April at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.

“Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago),” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.

Having faced withering criticism for Trump’s frequent weekend and holiday trips to his clubs, the White House is sensitive to any implication that the president is shirking his duties by enjoying downtime at his properties.

On Wednesday, just moments after a Washington Post reporter traveling with the president sent a message to the broader press corps saying the White House expected a “low-key day,” the reporter sent another dispatch correcting her previous statement.

“While the White House communications staff expects the press pool to have a ‘low-key day,’ the president will NOT have a low-key day and has a full schedule of meetings and phone calls,” wrote the reporter, who was part of a small group of journalists known as the “pool” who travel with the president and distribute reports detailing his activities.

A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request from POLITICO for more details on the president’s meetings and calls, nor did she respond to an inquiry about whether Trump played golf on Wednesday, one of his favorite leisure activities.

Trump has visited his own properties at least 99 times since taking office, including 77 stops at properties that feature golf courses, according to an NBC News tally . He has often been photographed by fellow golfers, whose posts have appeared on social media even as the White House refuses to acknowledge the president’s time on the links.

During the campaign, Trump repeatedly asserted that he didn’t like taking time off and wouldn’t vacation if elected. “I would rarely leave the White House because there’s so much work to be done,” Trump told The Hill in 2015. ""I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.”

Trump’s propensity to play golf is also notable because he frequently criticized former President Barack Obama for spending time on the course.

“Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf,” Trump tweeted in 2014.

Trump has so far played golf more often than Obama did at this point in his first year in office, according to PolitiFact .

Trump’s visits to Mar-a-Lago and his nearby golf club this week come at a crucial moment for tax reform, one of his top legislative priorities. They also come as lawmakers in the House and Senate are working to reach a year-end agreement to avoid a government shutdown. Trump is slated to meet with top congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss the contours of the year-end deal.

The White House frequently tries to tightly control how the public perceives the president. During his grueling 12-day, five-country tour of Asia, White House aides repeatedly insisted the president wasn’t tired, even though nearly everybody traveling with him could barely keep their eyes open.

Trump, 71, at times looked fatigued during the trip. But he insisted he wasn’t, instead shifting attention to the bleary-eyed reporters traveling with him.

“We’ll make some comments probably tomorrow afternoon, only because we have to let the media recover,” Trump said in the Philippines earlier this month, referring to the timing of a then-pending statement at the White House. “They want to recover. When I said we’ll do it on Wednesday morning, they all said, ‘Will we do it later than that?’”","trump international golf

President Donald Trump and top congressional leaders will meet next week to try to hammer out a year-end agreement to avert a government shutdown, according to multiple sources, as Capitol Hill careens toward a legislative pile-up next month.

The so-called Big Four — Speaker Paul Ryan, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — haven’t even agreed on total government spending levels that would allow appropriators to write a massive funding bill for the rest of the fiscal year.

Story Continued Below

That means a short-term funding extension to keep the government operating beyond a Dec. 8 deadline is all but inevitable. Congressional leaders would likely need to reach an agreement on the top-line figures by early next week for there to be any chance of finishing an omnibus spending bill in December.

The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday at 3 p.m., according to congressional sources and a White House official. White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters later said in a statement, ""The President will be meeting with congressional leaders next week to discuss end-of-year legislative issues.""

In addition to having to move a must-pass bill to fund the government, Republicans hope to pass a sweeping rewrite of the tax code by Christmas.

Further complicating matters is the ongoing dispute over the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Obama-era initiative that has shielded hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation.

Trump has announced that DACA permits will expire beginning in March, although immigration advocates have said scores of current DACA recipients have already lost protections because they weren’t able to get their status renewed before an October deadline.

One source familiar with the negotiations said Democrats, particularly Pelosi, have pushed aggressively to include a DACA fix to a short-term continuing resolution that would keep the government open beyond Dec. 8. A Democratic leadership aide said Pelosi has not asked specifically for a DACA fix to be attached to a short-term extension, although she and Schumer have been publicly adamant that a legislative solution for DACA needs to pass Congress next month.

Democratic leaders have also insisted on ensuring that any agreement to raise defense spending above sequester levels also boosts funding for domestic programs.

Now the company is dealing with another consumer backlash, this time with its highly lucrative FIFA 18.

A consumer campaign called #FixFifa emerged this week from fans of the popular soccer series. Posts, videos and threads have sprung up on Reddit, YouTube and Twitter. A Change.org petition has so far attracted more than 23,000 signatures.

Black Friday is usually a busy time for FIFA players, with new special packs being offered in-game. But the #FixFifa campaign is calling on players to ignore any new offers, and to hold back on spending money in the game.

The campaign asks EA to fix a host of problems with FIFA, including annoying gameplay cheats, balancing issues and glitches. But FIFA 18's heavy emphasis on in-game purchases is attracting a lot of negative noise.

Like all recent games in the series, FIFA 18 allows its users to earn in-game currency in order to create an ""Ultimate Team"" made up of their favorite players. This is a central part of the game, but it can take a serious time investment to attain top stars.

Many prefer to spend real money on player packs in order to upgrade their teams, or to engage in profitable trades. EA also organizes challenges and tournaments that can generate in-game currency. But some FIFA fans say Ultimate Team is designed to encourage spending on packs, because of the massive time commitment needed to raise currency.

FIFA YouTuber Goran Popovic posted a detailed document and video about the game’s issues. He told Polygon that the number of hours required to earn a top soccer star is prohibitive. The price of a single player, like Cristiano Ronaldo, might easily involve hundreds of hours of play. Of course, soccer teams are made up of 11 players plus substitutes. The time commitment needed to create a full team of stars is enormous.

Drop-rates for top players in FIFA 18 are not officially released, but world-class stars are rare. Popovic said he and a friend had spent $500 between them, and received only one top player: a goalkeeper.

""I get that Ultimate Team was designed to make money for EA, lots of money. But the balance has shifted from a good game with micro-transactions to one where you kind of need to spend money to save time, unless you're super lucky or one of the greatest players.""

On Reddit, FIFA fan SSROCK outlined a list of demands underpinning #FixFifa. ""The packs are completely [random] and have terrible drop rates. You can either spend $1.50 and get the best player in the game, or spend thousands of dollars and get nothing. People with the best teams in the game have spent a whopping $8,000, which is absurd, especially for a yearly game.""

In-game purchases are a major part of EA's business model, as evidenced in the company's most recent financial statement.

""We saw a notable shift to digital in our sports titles and remarkable growth in Ultimate Team,” said chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen. “Our sports titles have once again shown their value in delivering a stable and dependable performance. They can drive our business and offers a window into how our games will evolve over the months and years to come.”

Polygon has requested comment from EA.","star wars battlefront

It seems Nintendo has taken note of the problem. A new message has popped up in the game addressing the game's performance.

Blaming ""high traffic,"" the message states that ""the issue is still occurring intermittently. Please be aware that we are investigating it and will resolve it as soon as possible. Thank you to those users who have contacted us or left feedback regarding this issue.""

Our review stated that it's ""a thudding, explicitly violent game that doesn’t mind looking into the heart of the people involved in war.

According to a report in PCGamesN, Marvel Heroes will be shut down at the end of this week. Dismayed employees took to Twitter, explaining that they had expected to be working — and receiving benefits — until the end of the year.

Whether its the holidays, a get together or a weekend with terrible weather, local multiplayer games are one of the best ways to have fun with friends in the same room.

We’ve compiled a list of games for players looking to use teamwork to win and a handful for those who want victory all for themselves.

Couch co-op games

If you’re in the spirit to cooperate with your fellow players and want to work toward a common goal, here are a few games you can play that require teamwork to win.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (PC, Mac, PlayStation VR, Android)

Polygon Plays: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is one of the best games on Oculus Rift. Until you get vaporized. Watch Charlie, Susana, Samit, Dave and Griffin give it a try: http://bit.ly/1RTsmZ3 Posted by Polygon on Friday, February 19, 2016

If you’ve ever seen a team of specialists defuse a bomb in a movie and thought, “Hey, I’d love to do that in front of my friends and family”, then Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is the game for you.

One player takes the role of the bomb defuser and can only keep their eyes on the screen (or better yet, inside their VR goggles). Their teammates cannot look at the screen and the only thing they can do is talk directly to the player who is defusing the bomb. The teammates are equipped with an actual bomb defusal manual, which they can view online or print out. As you play, the actions you need to perform in order to defuse bombs not only randomly change but get more complex over time. It’s a heart-racing but absolutely fantastic experience.

Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime (PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)

While you can play this game alone, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime really opens up when you and three other players control the various weapons and gadgets aboard your spaceship.

Cooperation is key in this game since each player has an important role to play, whether that’s controlling the thrusters, swinging around your ship’s shield or blasting away at the galaxy’s various enemies. While the game is an adventure and has a very light story, you can jump into any stage and be treated with a randomly generated level, giving this game endless replayability.

Overcooked (PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)

I’m sure plenty of us have had our share of arguments and mishaps trying to cook with friends and family. The good news is, you can relive all those fun memories with Overcooked.

Up to four players can run around an evolving series of bizarrely designed kitchens as you all try your best to cooperatively prepare, cook and serve meals under strict deadlines. The ballet of self-assigning roles throughout the kitchen and then carrying out tasks are only amplified in absurdity in later levels as the kitchens themselves move and morph to sabotage your teamwork. I swear this game is more fun than it sounds, that is, if yelling at your friends and family is your type of fun. We love it and you can watch us being our most polite selves in the video above.

Octodad: Dadliest Catch (PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)

This is definitely an absurd recommendation, but one worth checking out.

In Octodad, players must run through the daily routines of a cephalopod trying to get through his day to day as an average human being. Making matters worse is that if four players team up, each one takes control of one of Octodad’s limbs. Even as a single player, the limb-based control scheme is difficult enough. Having four players independently controlling each appendage only makes this game goofier.

Competitive games

Maybe you’re the type that wants to experience the fun of crushing your enemies face to face. If that’s the case, here’s a handful of games that allow you to talk smack and ruin friendships in person.

GANG BEASTS (PC, Mac, PlayStation 4)

Four-player fighting games are a blast but are often not as fun for players who aren’t skilled at fighting games. Thankfully, Gang Beasts is the farthest thing from a traditional fighting game. Its quirky charm makes it as fun to play as it is to watch.

At its core, Gang Beasts is a four-player punch-fest featuring pudgy, soft combatants. There aren’t combos or special moves to master, just basic controls that allow your fighter to punch, grab and jump. Despite the simple controls, the appeal of Gang Beasts stems from how wildly your characters move about. They wobble as they run, their punches land with an odd mixture of adorableness and sheer violence and the simple act of jumping seems to make their bodies flail about in the most unpredictable ways. You can watch us playing the game above.

Crawl (PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One)

Crawl GAMEPLAY! We're playing Crawl! Watch Patrick, Simone, Susana and Jeff test out a local multiplayer dungeon crawler where friends control the monsters. Posted by Polygon on Friday, October 21, 2016

If you’re a fan of dungeon crawling games but want a twist on the genre, then check out Crawl. At first glance, Crawl looks like your average dungeon crawler where a single player must fight their way through a series of rooms, defeating a horde of enemies on their way to a final boss.

While that is exactly what one player will be doing while playing this game, the other three players are actually controlling the enemies and the final boss. When you fire the game up, all four players start in a room in their human forms and must immediately fight to the death. The winner gets to begin the dungeon crawl, while the defeated enemies become ghosts who can summon enemies. As the game progresses, the human player must stay alive long enough to make it to the final boss. If the human player dies, the player who defeated them becomes the human. This cycle continues until a human makes their way to the boss, which is simultaneously controlled by the three enemy players. Crawl is a wild tug-of-war worth struggling through in the hopes that you might end up being the player who gets to slay the boss.

Move or Die (PC, Mac)

Move or Die GAMEPLAY! We're playing Move or Die Game, a 4-player party title that's been described as the ""perfect friendship-ruining game."" Challenge accepted. Posted by Polygon on Friday, November 18, 2016

It’s always good when a game describes how to play it right there in the title. Move or Die takes the simple premise its name serves up and allows players to add a huge list of modifiers that act as unique game modes to make this game fresh and frantic as hell.

In Move or Die, players must survive through a host of different game modes until one player is left alive. The main way to win is to keep moving because if you stand still, your life quickly drains. So you must constantly be mobile or it’s game over for you. To keep things extra spicy, the game adds bizarre game modes like giving players a gun, but they can only shoot while spinning in midair or a game type where you need to dodge a massive spike ball. Add in modifiers like turning invisible and you can imagine how all these permutations make for a wild time.

The Jackbox Party Pack (PC, Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)

The Jackbox series is fantastic for a host of reasons, but three of the biggest are the fact that the party game series exists on just about every platform; you can have up to eight players in most games; and there’s no need for controllers — all you need is your smartphone.

Whether you’re buying the newly released fourth version of the Party Pack or any of the others, each edition of the series is filled with a handful of party games that don’t require anything from players other than a sense of humor. Some games will have you crafting the best lie. Some might have you doodling crude pictures on your smart phone or thinking of the most creative ways to embarrass your friends, family or coworkers. The Jackbox series easily fulfills your dreams of embarrassing your loved ones on a weird game show.","octodad dadliest catch pc mac playstation

Allegra Frank,‘A communication error has occurred’ is the most painful phrase in the English language,2017-11-22T20:10:02Z,polygon,Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp server errors are bringing us down,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/22/16691110/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-server-errors,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eJfgmpKpmgBBnlIQRdvGlaG_UOY=/0x234:575x535/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9737819/THftIW6whKA5yCXkkT1LGNpPOTMCvbAksiyK_IodSlA.jpg,gaming,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is a good time so far — when it works. The new mobile game is suffering from some painful server problems, leading to frequent crashes, communication errors and infinite load times.

I’ve had all of the above happen to me, sometimes in the same playthrough. Loading up the game takes time, which is to be expected (as I wrote yesterday). On a design level, Animal Crossing has never been about expedience, anyway. (I wrote about that, too.) But, when I begin to dig into its menus, Pocket Camp starts to lose its grip.

Adding friends is already a laborious process of cycling through submenus and collecting friend codes, and it’s made even more so when the game crashes as soon as I finish entering a fellow player’s ID. That’s, of course, if the game even loads up the friends manager in the first place. There have been several times where I had to close out Pocket Camp a few times for it to cooperate with me on simple tasks like this one.

The situation that many of us share is the dreaded communication error pop-up. These will happen out of nowhere, often after an especially long wait to move to a new area or complete a task.

Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp mood board pic.twitter.com/eZlXhXXLLf — Katie Hughes (@temporarywhales) November 22, 2017

The culprit behind the communication errors is pretty obvious. Mobile games based off Nintendo properties aren’t known for their stable servers; Pocket Camp is also a multiplayer-focused game with a big audience, so some lag is to be expected. But is it unfair to think that Nintendo would have gotten this together by now?

Perhaps, but, counterpoint: It’s unfair to deprive me from my much-needed Animal Crossing time. Let’s hope that Nintendo works it out before the long weekend is through. I’ve reached out for an update.","katie hughes temporarywhales

Allegra Frank,A classic pair returns for a two-parter,2017-08-28T16:30:02Z,polygon,The Pokémon anime’s bringing Brock and Misty back (update),https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/28/16182746/pokemon-sun-and-moon-anime-brock-and-misty,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6RkESCxJapvGgk7Z-gjgchBn4IM=/0x116:1011x645/fit-in/1200x630/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9129043/Screen_Shot_2017_08_28_at_12.19.19_PM.png,gaming,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Brock and Misty are heading back to the Pokémon cartoon next month, according to a new issue of Japanese kids’ magazine Telubi-kun. Ash Ketchum will reunite with his OG best friends in a Pokémon Sun and Moon two-parter that sends him home to Kanto.

Ash has been living in the Alola region this season, hanging out with Pikachu and making some new, goofy friends. But you never forget your first travel companions, and so Brock and Misty remain beloved. When this summer’s Pokémon movie — a reimagining of the first season — ditched the pair in favor of some unfamiliar faces, old-school fans were rightfully upset.

Consider this the Pokémon Company’s attempt at making amends. Ash and Pikachu drop by Kanto for a “school project,” and part of their visit has them duking it out with an older, more experienced Brock and Misty.

A scan of the magazine suggests that the Kanto natives look much the same, even though we haven’t seen them in several years. Misty’s last appearance in the series was in 2005; Brock lasted much longer, departing in 2011.

We’re way behind Japan when it comes to Sun and Moon, so while the episodes will air overseas on Sept. 14 and Sept. 21, the English-language version won’t debut here for a good long while. Take heart that the classic trio will be back together again soon enough, at least for a little while.

Update: The two-part reunion special will begin airing on Disney XD in the U.S. on Nov. 25 at 9:30 a.m. local time. The first episode, “Alola, Kanto!” will air that Saturday, with the second part, “When Regions Collide!” airing the following week, on Dec. 2.","telubikun ash ketchum

Rani Molla,“Nobody is okay with this.”,2017-09-14T16:40:49Z,recode,How Bozoma Saint John plans to fix Uber’s brand problem,https://www.recode.net/2017/9/14/16306484/uber-bozoma-saint-john-brand-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-trade-secret-apple-music,https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RDdwlKxFglwJTgqkKN1lDZ_4ZnQ=/0x0:2880x1508/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9246605/REC_KMACDONALD_CODECOMMERCE17_20170914_114617_5838.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Bozoma Saint John, Uber’s newly minted chief brand officer, wants to take a brand with an ugly image — sexual harassment, stolen trade secrets, profiteering off protests — and make it something people love.

“There needs to be love there, some emotion connecting the user to the product,” Saint John told Recode Thursday at Code Commerce in New York City. “We’ve got to get people to be in love with the product.”

That won’t come as a campaign. “You have to show it,” Saint John, formerly the head of global consumer marketing for Apple Music and iTunes, said. “I don’t think you can in an ad.”

To Saint John, building a new brand image has to happen in the background through human resources, changing company culture and hiring women and people of color.

“There has to be more of us. Hire more women. The numbers matter in this particular case,” Saint John said. “There’s no magical Wizard of Oz that’s going to fix this for us.”

To the public, she wants to change the narrative to tell Uber’s other stories.

“It’s about storytelling, about upward mobility, movement,” she said. “I want to see drivers who’ve changed their lives because of this opportunity.”

To that end, Saint John plans to drive an Uber herself.

How would Saint John prevent issues like the #DeleteUber campaign, which hurt Uber’s business earlier this year when customers perceived the brand as taking advantage of a taxi strike?

“Sometimes it can be as simple as a statement. Uber has made statements about things that as a company and a country we don’t want to stand for.”

On diversity problems in Silicon Valley:

“This is not unique to Silicon Valley, it happens in grocery stores. I’ve been a black person all my life ... It is really bad in Silicon Valley and that’s where I work.”

On why she took a job at Uber for professional reasons:

“As a marketer, a brand person can rarely come in and literally put your stamp on it and say I did that ... It’s about the total structure of a brand.”

On why she took a job at Uber for personal reasons:

“If I can go into the situation like this — the tip of the spear for what is wrong — and we can fix that thing, I know for sure this will be all right. I want to hold up the mirror and say if this place can do it, so can everyplace else. I want to feel that. I don’t want to be in a situation where I feel like I can’t produce or can’t be my whole self because of prejudices or uncomfortable situations because of who I am.”

Peter Kafka,"Pro sports on TV looks the same way it looked 30 years ago, Adam Silver says. He thinks the internet can change that.",2017-09-13T20:21:24Z,recode,The head of the NBA wants his games to look more like Twitch,https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16304278/nba-twitch-adam-silver-tv-ratings-facebook-amazon,https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGiDlyVV3H235s1OlhqmFR43FdQ=/0x0:2880x1508/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9240307/NBA_Commissioner_Adam_Silver_Code_Commerce.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"TV viewership is dropping across the board — including for live sports, which were supposed to be immune to shrinking ratings.

NBA boss Adam Silver has a solution: Make sports look more like video games.

Specifically, make them look like Twitch, Amazon’s platform for live gaming, which features a blizzard of live stats and a steady stream of chatter from gamers watching the event in real time.

“I think to a lot of older consumers, used to looking at sports, it might might look incredibly cluttered,” Silver said at the Code Commerce event in New York City. But it’s the kind of presentation that could appeal to younger viewers, he said.

Silver, whose league has made a point of embracing Twitter and other digital media outlets, argued that traditional TV broadcasts of NBA games and other pro sports have been essentially unchanged for the past 30 years. It’s “almost like a silent movie,” he said.

Right now, if Silver wants to see those kinds of changes in the U.S., he will have to hope that ESPN or Turner — which own most of the digital rights for his league — innovate in the way they present their games online.

But when those deals expire, he certainly expects Facebook, Amazon and other big tech companies to use innovation in the way they present his product as part of their offer. “The best sales pitch to us is how they’re going to find new ways to engage our fans in these telecasts,” he said.

Retail has to rethink itself.

That’s the message Kirsten Green, founder of VC firm Forerunner Ventures, gave today during a presentation to Code Commerce attendees in New York City.

To illustrate the tricky situation, Green noted that 43 percent of consumers admit “owning today feels like a burden.” Additionally, 77 percent of people say social media is the main source of inspiration for the products they buy.

Green knows what she’s talking about. Her firm has had uncanny success backing e-commerce startups. It was the lead backer in Dollar Shave Club, which sold to Unilever for $1 billion, and it invested in Jet.com, which Walmart acquired for $3.3 billion.

Green noted in her presentation that mall traffic is shrinking but consumers are still buying. These are confusing stats to navigate but Green thinks there’s plenty of hope, as evidenced by the $45 billion pop-up industry, in which retailers or brands create a temporary shopping experience.

She also pointed to in-store augmented and virtual reality displays, concierge-style services and made-to-order merchandise as ways that retailers can elevate ho-hum shopping to the level of an experience.

“I certainly don’t think we’re in the midst of a retail apocalypse,” Alber said. “I do not believe that and I do not believe that Amazon is killing retailers. I believe retailers’ bad service is killing retailers. And I think because of that you might not go to the malls as much as you used to.”

For that reason, Alber said Williams-Sonoma and its separate brands — including Pottery Barn and West Elm — are continuing to innovate around its service.

“We’re very focused on improving our customer service and not just in-store but also the delivery,” she said at Recode’s Code Commerce event in New York. “We just got done with a board meeting; we measured every single piece of our delivery to the customer [and] we’re now having customers rate at us at every single point.”

“Moving large-scale furniture is difficult, which is why it’s a huge differentiator,” she said. “If you can do something hard well that’s an advantage.”

Still, Alber said the companies have experimented with new digital experiences for e-commerce.

Pottery Barn has partnered with Google on an augmented reality app that lets consumers reimagine their home with furniture from the store.

“We want to lead on these things,” she said. “We knew the Tango phone, there’s not a lot of them out there. We’re great partners with Google [and] we do a lot of things with them. But we also did it because we wanted to be ready when it came on the Apple phone. The Tango phone had the depth perception that allowed this to happen.”

Now, the company has about 140,000 3-D models built for this AR/VR experience. However, Alber concedes that there are few Tango phones out there so the current application is used mostly in stores.

“What I’m focused on is putting our application on the Apple phone,” she said.

Eric Johnson,Van Susteren’s new book is a guide to social platforms for people who don’t want to “call a kid.”,2017-11-22T15:57:05Z,recode,"Despite the toxicity, former cable news anchor Greta Van Susteren is not giving up on social media",https://www.recode.net/2017/11/22/16688306/greta-van-susteren-social-media-book-sorry-app-recode-decode-podcast-kara-swisher-hilary-rosen,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrvL0PTje4EwJQ5b5TXdPDGKLIs=/0x89:2154x1217/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9731947/526234262.jpg.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"From trolling to election meddling to outright abuse, there are plenty of ways social media can be used for ill. But no matter what, we still will want to use it, Greta Van Susteren says.

“I’ve seen some pretty horrible things on the internet, horrible things said about me,” Van Susteren said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. “The internet’s here to stay, social media’s here to stay. We can all sit around and hate it for its nastiness. I haven’t given up. I still think it’s a wonderful research tool, there are wonderful things you can do with it. ... I’d like to flood it with better things.”

“It’s going to be an uphill battle,” she added. “Hate is a very powerful weapon. I might give up on social media if I thought it was going away, but it’s not.”

Van Susteren, who formerly anchored shows on CNN, Fox News and (briefly) MSNBC, has a new book all about social media out called “Everything You Need to Know about Social Media (Without Having to Call a Kid).” Speaking with Recode’s Kara Swisher and SKDK’s Hilary Rosen, she said the book is aimed at the over-40 set ... or the people under 40 who want to buy something so that their parents will stop asking them questions.

As one of the 45 people followed by the 45th president, Donald Trump, Van Susteren said she doesn’t see him as governing through Twitter, as some critics allege, but rather engaging with voters and picking fights. However, she’s not a fan of his tone.

“I like manners,” she said. “Once in a while, people get under my skin and I take the bait — but for the most part, I don’t. It’s just not the way I would tweet.”

You can listen to Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

On the new podcast, Van Susteren also talked about why she believes companies like Facebook and Twitter should get more proactive about controlling their platforms and not letting bad actors run away with them.

“All these social media platform companies, they want to pretend they’re the telephone company, and they can’t help it if you’re making obscene phone calls or prank calls,” she said. “They are more than that; they’re much like Drudge, they’re aggregators of news. ... They have a choice: They can either figure out a solution themselves — which would be a really good idea, because the American people are fed up — or they run the risk that Congress is going to get in their business and start regulating them.”

Part of the solution, however, will also have to come from the people who use those platforms. Van Susteren said news consumers “have to be more vigilant.”

“If you read something that seems unbelievable, chances are it is unbelievable,” she said. “A good consumer, if you’re gonna go out and buy a stereo, at least you’re going to look at Consumer Reports, in the old days. People should cross-check, look at the sources, know the sources, be an aggressive consumer of news.”

Eric Johnson,"There are still more “powerful men” who have yet to be exposed, Masters said — right before she published a bombshell story about Disney and Pixar exec John Lasseter.",2017-11-22T11:30:01Z,recode,"Hollywood’s sexual harassment story is far from over, says the Hollywood Reporter’s Kim Masters",https://www.recode.net/2017/11/22/16688132/kim-masters-hollywood-reporter-harvey-weinstein-louis-ck-john-lasseter-media-peter-kafka-podcast,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSzPRmteMxgvhMYkJR6vjIzggoA=/0x180:3867x2205/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9731793/Kim_Masters.png,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Harvey Weinstein. Roy Price. Kevin Spacey. Jeffrey Tambor. Louis C.K. Charlie Rose. And now, John Lasseter.

The list of prominent men in the media world who have been accused of routine sexual harassment is long and getting longer by the day. But the Hollywood Reporter’s editor-at-large, Kim Masters, says the story is not going away because there are still more men like them you haven’t heard about yet.

Job No. 1 for journalists like her is to get their victims to talk on the record.

“There’s a continuum of conduct. On the one end, there’s Harvey Weinstein/Kevin Spacey, seemingly criminal misconduct, and I don’t have a lot of sympathy for those people at all,” Masters said on the latest episode of Recode Media with Peter Kafka. “I think they deserve whatever befalls them. And at the far extreme on the other end, there are people who are just obviously, borderline pathetic, but also sick.”

“Some of these people — and this does include Louis C.K. and other names that haven’t become public yet — I can tell you, there are names you wish to unhear,” she added.

Less than an hour after this podcast taping concluded, Masters published a story about Pixar and Disney Animation exec John Lasseter’s history of sexual misconduct in the workplace. According to the report, Lasseter acknowledged his “missteps” in a memo to employees and is currently on a six-month leave of absence from Disney.

You can listen to Recode Media on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

The Weinstein story, which for years many journalists had tried to get people to talk about on the record, opened the floodgates for everyone who has followed, including former Amazon executive Roy Price.

“There was just such a rush of news after the Harvey story broke,” Masters said. “It opened the door for the Amazon Studios story and, all of a sudden, people were calling and emailing and I keep saying, it’s like that scene in ‘MASH’ where the helicopters start landing.”

“We were evaluating constantly, ‘What can we get?’” she added. “‘What stories are the most gettable? Should we try this right away? Should we put this one aside for special concentration because the allegations are so egregious?’ And everything else started to seem, you know, less important.”

So why is harassment and other bad behavior seemingly so commonplace in Hollywood? Masters said the answer is obvious and visible in plain sight: There aren’t enough women “behind the camera.”

“It’s become increasingly clear to me the pervasiveness of misconduct, and not necessarily confining that sexual harassment,” she said. “There’s a frat-boy thing going on at a bunch of these companies and they don’t want women in the mix. They want to go to Vegas and do their thing without women making them feel like they can’t ... Until they start deciding, ‘Maybe we’re going to hire more women and promote more women,’ the risk of this abuse is there, and that’s why the conversation has to continue.”

Eric Johnson,"It’s time for the most powerful companies in digital media to stop playing dumb, Brown says.",2017-11-20T11:30:02Z,recode,Why magazine mogul Tina Brown is 'angry and upset' at Google and Facebook,https://www.recode.net/2017/11/20/16677194/tina-brown-vanity-fair-diaries-new-yorker-daily-beast-facebook-google-decode-kara-swisher-podcast,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfGIyI2r99BnaTB9pxrV-s6rIFE=/0x256:1400x989/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9714651/Tina_Brown___Brigitte_Lacombe.png,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Starting in her 20s as the editor of Tatler Magazine in London, Tina Brown rode a wave of print magazines to become one of the most influential people in the media. She tells a good portion of that story in her new no-holds-barred memoir, “The Vanity Fair Diaries: 1983 - 1992.”

But after editing Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and the short-lived Talk magazine (which was financed by Harvey Weinstein), Brown moved her editing online, founding the Daily Beast in 2008. On the latest episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, she explained why she left that publication after six years, and why the new power players in media — tech companies like Google and Facebook — have left her feeling frustrated.

“I am very angry and upset about the way advertising revenue has been essentially pirated by the Facebook-Google world, without nearly enough giveback — no giveback, really — to the people who create those brilliant pieces that are posted all over their platforms,” Brown said. “It’s high time they gave back to journalism.”

She proposed the creation of a “huge journalism fund” for local media, even though she doubts that that would ever happen.

“They have no interest, I realize that,” Brown said. “It’s like, ‘Oh, we’re not a media company, we’re a platform.’ Okay, well, guess what? When you don’t have human beings who have judgment, who have taste, who have a sense of responsibility, you can have any old Russian hacker dishing it out to the American public.”

“Opinion-forming, influential content, it’s very hard to find and support and have an impact with,” she added. “People don’t know what’s important or where to find it. So it doesn’t wash to say, ‘There’s so many transactions, everybody can find it.’ It’s a needle in a haystack for so many people.”

You can listen to Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

On the new podcast, Brown said she’s also concerned about how the global reach of social media platforms could over-amplify voices that don’t represent how most people feel, or shouldn’t be the loudest in the room.

“A flash mob can suddenly form very, very quickly around a person, and wow!” Brown said. “Suddenly, their reputation is shredded, and they’re sent spinning by the dissent of a thousand people writing abusive stuff about them. It’s a frightening thing, actually. It can lead to a lot of stress and dangerous emotions, and ultimately could lead to violence.”

“You know, I think we’ve also seen the empowering of a lot of delinquent voices, in a sense,” she added. “In the past, [they] would be some crazy person muttering in a bar. All of a sudden, there’s a huge community around those voices and they have influence and power and they can multiply, and that adds to the toxicity of the culture.”

If journalists are looking for hope among the tech giants of Silicon Valley, Brown said, their best bet might be Apple.

“Steve Jobs was a typographer himself, he always cared about design,” she said. “There’s a sense of excellence there that has always been about rejection of the mediocre. I am hoping that they might step in to do something really good in journalism.”

Jeffrey Goldberg works at 1Password and holds the title of Chief Defender of the Dark Arts, so who better to answer our curious readers?

You can read some of the highlights from the discussion here, or listen to it in the audio player above. Below, we’ve posted a lightly edited complete transcript of their conversation.

If you like this, be sure to subscribe to Too Embarrassed to Ask on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

Kara Swisher: Hi, I’m Kara Swisher, executive editor of Recode.

Lauren Goode: And I’m Lauren Goode, senior tech editor at The Verge.

KS: And you’re listening to Too Embarrassed to Ask, coming to you from the Vox Media podcast network. This is a show where we answer all of your embarrassing questions about consumer tech.

LG: It could be anything at all, like whether or not Kara has watched the new season of my YouTube series, “Next Level.” Have you watched it?

KS: No. But I will, I promise. Right after I don’t watch “House of Cards,” I now have a free area. But yes, I will do that tonight, absolutely.

LG: Okay, well, just slide me right into your “House of Cards” slot, because I can tell you that mine is a little bit less scandalous.

KS: All right, fantastic.

Anyway, send us your question, find us on Twitter, or tweet them to at Recode, or myself, or to Lauren, with the #tooembarrassed.

LG: We also have an email address, it’s tooembarrassed@recode.net. And a friendly reminder, there are two Rs and two Ss in embarrassed.

So sometimes on this show I like to joke that Kara’s password is something really absurdly easy to guess, like 123456 or “password” or “Lauren is the real driving force behind this show.” That really is her password.

KS: No, it’s not. I have very good passwords, and I used 1Password. It’s not the last one for sure.

LG: We both use password managers, because in case you’ve missed the memo, you’re not supposed to have something absurdly simple or guessable for a password. And you’re absolutely not supposed to use the same password for multiple accounts, because if someone is able to brute force their way into one of your accounts, they could use that information to reverse engineer their way into other accounts. You use 1Password, Kara?

KS: Yeah, I do. We use password managers. I use 1Password because I think it’s important to have ... And I use two-step verification. I use all the things that you can do. Although I still think, “Why in the world, in this day and age, do have password? There should be another way to do this.” I try to use, when I use other things, my eyeball, or my fingerprint, or things like that. But I do use 1Password now at this moment in time.

LG: How do you use an eyeball when you wear sunglasses indoors all the time?

KS: It’ll be just fine. I take off my glasses, and I put it to the eyeball meter, or whatever. A lot of people still have questions about these services, why it’s a good thing. We’re joined by Jeffrey Goldberg of AgileBits. It’s the maker of 1Password. Jeffrey’s other title is the Defender Against the Dark Arts, which ... Okay Jeffrey, welcome to Too Embarrassed to Ask.

Jeffrey Goldberg: Well, thank you very much. It’s really great to be here. I really like talking about passwords and password managers.

KS: Fantastic. All right, so explain, just explain to start with what 1Password does, and services like it. Just let’s try to be as broad as possible.

As you’ve mentioned, people should not use easy-to-guess passwords. And even more importantly, people should not use the same passwords on multiple site, because if one of those gets compromised, then in a sense, every place you use that same password gets compromised.

Here you are, you’ve got security experts telling people, “Don’t use easy-to-guess passwords, and use a unique one for each and every site that you use.” Most people have scores of different sites and services. Now they might think they only have a smaller handful, because they only think about the ones that they use on a daily basis, or weekly basis, but overall people have lots and lots and lots of site services.

You’ve got these security people, people like me, telling people to do the impossible: A unique, hard-to-guess password for each site and service. That’s just not humanly possible. And the password manager is a tool that is designed to help manage these things so that you don’t have to actually know the vast majority of your passwords. I don’t know my Facebook password. I don’t know, I simply don’t know most of my passwords. What I do know is my master password for 1Password. With the password manager, it not only remembers all of these different passwords and allows me to have different passwords for all of these sites. It can be used to create very strong passwords for each one of these sites. Most password managers have tools for integrating with web browsers, as does 1Password, so that it actually makes it easier to fill in the login forms that you come across for site after site.

LG: Basically it’s a service where instead of you having to humanly remember all of these complicated, long, multi-character passwords, you pay for the service and 1Password does it for you. So then across devices, you can easily sort of grab that password and plug it in when you need to. There are other services out there in addition to 1Password that do this. We’ve talked about LastPass and Dashlane before on this show.

I have another question about why 1Password does these sort of the scramble of random characters. Because some security experts say you should be using three random but complete words. It’s kind of like a nonsensical phrase, but they’re real words. Others say it’s better to use that scramble of random characters. Why does 1Password operate the way it does, and which is better in your mind?

I love this question. I should actually say that one of my lame claims to fame is that I helped repopularize this notion of using truly randomly chosen words. The main difference is whether it’s a password you’re never going to need to type or remember, versus a password that you will never need to type or remember, and you can leave to your password manager. If there’s something that you can leave entirely to your password manager, you use the completely scrambled word business. I mean, completely scrambled letters, because that is going to be stronger per just length of password. If you’re using a 20-character password, something that’s just the scrambled characters and letters is going to be enormously stronger than something based on a word list. But which one are you more likely to remember, if it’s a password that you need to remember?

We do recommend things like the word-list-based password for your 1Password master password. It is something you’re going to have to type, and it is something you’re going to have to remember. But for the passwords that you use for all the sites and services that 1Password is managing for you, there, just use our password generator that generates complete utter gibberish of characters.

KS: Okay, let’s talk about what’s going on in the password industry. You all ... Essentially, you get these services, you use them to open different sites, and they populate them. Apple does the same thing, you can save passwords on the Apple systems. These are still enormously confusing to use. Why don’t we talk about where this whole sector is going. At some point we’re not going to have all passwords. Why don’t we talk about sort of the state of the art right now, what’s the best things people can do, and then where it’s going?

This is a really interesting question. But I should preface this by saying, back in the ’90s, when I first started worrying about the password problem, which is that we’re asking people to do things that are impossible. And since people won’t do what’s impossible, then you have all these security problems. I and some other people came up with various schemes, and we thought we were going to more or less eliminate passwords for the most part within the next five years.

Well, as I said, that was in the mid-90s, and it was one of my predictions that was spectacularly wrong. Since then, I’ve seen proposals to eliminate passwords come and go. As a consequence, I’m a bit pessimistic about any new proposal about what’s going to replace passwords. Simply because I’ve seen them come and go, and I’ve understood why they’ve gone as well.

LG: But is it worth noting that in the mid-90s, the access to things like biometric scanning, it wasn’t as accessible to everybody yet. That was very futuristic at the time, and maybe it was the kind of thing that would work at your well-funded office building. But now we are seeing biometric scanning happening right on our consumer devices, our personal devices. Everyone has fingerprint scanners, in some cases iris scanners and now even 3-D face scanners. That market has changed a little bit, too.

Yes, that definitely does change things, but things like these biometrics, I’m sorry again, I don’t know how to do this without getting too technical. Things like biometrics work very well for what’s called local authentication. You are proving yourself to the device that you are holding with you. You’re not actually proving who you are to some remote service. And so this is why, what’s still going on behind the scenes when you’re using these biometrics, is effectively, you’re using a password manager locally, that you’re unlocking with, say, your fingerprint. But then that is still using passwords back and forth to the remote service, or something like passwords. This is fine when you’re connecting specifically from that device.

Now with 1Password, you can synchronize your passwords, you can unlock it on your device with your fingerprint, so this is generally managed. But you are using ... effectively you’re using biometrics to open something that’s playing the role of a password manager, or in our case, is a password manager.

The reason that you don’t use biometrics to replace passwords in general as the way that a server will say how you prove your existence, is ... Well, one thing is consider what happens when a server’s breached and you’re told you have to change your password. You’ve got to change your password for that service, and you’ve got to change the password for every other service where you’ve reused that same password. Changing your fingerprint is a little bit harder. Imagine having to be told that you have to change your fingerprint.

LG: Right, yeah, so your fingerprint could be stolen, in other words. Your fingerprint or your face could be stolen. I see.

Right. And furthermore, in these cases, in the biometric cases, now I’m not saying that there isn’t a place for biometrics. Used for local authentication, they’re actually really good. But a fingerprint or your face are not secret, they’re really just another form of your mother’s maiden name. They’re things that maybe not everybody has access to, but they’re not things that are designed to be secret like a password.

KS: Is there anything that’s coming that’s ... Is there any other way to do it besides passwords, or is it just with us forever then?

As I said, I’ve been pessimistic about this. I’ve seen proposals come and go. There are some things that have me more optimistic about solving the password problem than I’ve been in a while. This is the, I think it’s been renamed, but the proposals out of the Fido Alliance. UTF and UTA solve the privacy problem that has existed with other schemes to eliminate passwords.

If we look at other schemes to eliminate passwords, let’s look at all this “log in with Google” or “log in with Facebook” that you find on site after site. These are these so-called single sign-on services. One of the difficulties with those is that you are letting Facebook or Google or whatever service you’re using know exactly when you’re signing into a site.

LG: Right, so they have more information, mm-hmm.

That might be fine for some people, but generally the technology community — or at least the security technology community — cares deeply about privacy, so we tend not to push for systems that are inherently non-private.

LG: But couldn’t it be argued that if I’m using a web browser and I go to Facebook.com — or some other sites, my Gmail or whatever it might be — and I use 1Password or any other password manager to authenticate, that service still knows that I’m using their service. Trust me, especially right now, I love the idea of having my data sort of siloed away from as many social networks as possible, because of what we’re seeing going on right now with social networks. But still, ultimately, if I go to them regardless of what password manager I’m using to log in, if I’m in Safari and I’m using Safari keychain or I’m using 1Password, everyone still knows where I’m going.

That is not the case with 1Password. We do not know, we’ve designed 1Password in such a way that when you visit a page, or open a login, we don’t know what sites you have logins for, and we don’t know when you use them.

KS: I think it’s a fair point. Do we want Google, Amazon, whatever, to know every single thing we do? They already do in a lot of ways.

This is one of the things that as the chief Defender Against the Dark Arts, I spend a lot of time on working and designing. We have designed 1Password in such a way that we do not receive any such information about your usage.

LG: I want to ask one question before we get to our reader questions, and we do have a lot. But earlier this year, some people in the security community were a little upset when 1Password began to emphasize cloud subscription packages over local vaults. I know one of the reasons why I first signed up for 1Password instead of the others is because of that local vault, and this idea that everything was local to my devices. But you also have a cloud service, and it’s subscription based. Talk about the difference between the two, and your response to people who were upset from this move away from the local vault.

Oh yeah, I’m happy to do that. First of all, the accounts or subscription service 1Password is for families, teams or individuals. It allows for ... One of the huge differences is that it allows for secure sharing of data among individuals. You can share vaults within your family, within your teams and manage things that way. That was not something that we could do with our standalone version.

The other thing that we can do with this is, of course people who were using the standalone version, the vast majority of them were still syncing their data. So while it’s the case that we never saw any of your data in any form whatsoever, even encrypted, most people were syncing with Dropbox. And Dropbox is fine, and we designed our data format to be secure if it gets captured from Dropbox, but when we designed our own system for managing that kind of synchronization, we were able to build it with additional security features and additional structure. And also simply making syncing much, much more reliable. Those are the two big things with using the subscription service.

There’s another benefit to users with the subscription service is that we consider somebody who’s using 1Password on any platform to be a 1Password customer. But given the way that app stores work, if you were buying standalone, and you are using an Android, iOS device, a Mac, a Windows machine, you would have to purchase 1Password for each and every one of those platforms when we are selling licenses for that, because there’s no way to sell it through a single store. A subscription allows us to treat people as 1Password customers, and then they can use 1Password on whatever platform.

KS: All right, okay, let’s get to the reader’s question. In a minute we’re going to take questions about passwords from our readers — we’ve got a lot of them, as Lauren said — and Jeffrey’s going to answer. But first we’re going to take a quick break for a word from our sponsors. Lauren?

LG: I was going to say ka-ching but I figured I should scramble it a little bit, so like ching-ka!s$.

[ad]

KS: We’re back here with AgileBits’ Jeffrey Goldberg, whose title is Defender Against the Dark Arts. We’re talking about password management, which is very critical these days, and will be forever, I think, as we get more digital. And now we’re going to take some questions about the topic from our readers and listeners. Lauren, would you read the first question? And Jeffrey, if you could keep your answers short because we got a ton of questions, that would be great.

LG: Sure, the first was around pricing. Jim Gresham wants to know, “How easy is it to set up and use the family/shared vaults? Does it cost extra?”

There’s a fixed priced for families. I do not actually know what we’re offering that price for. But it’s designed for families, and that should allow — I think currently — five family members. We certainly hope it is easy to set up. There’s a free trial, give it a shot.

KS: All right, the next question’s about competition. Ben Ford says, “How do they feel they compare to LastPass, because I couldn’t see any differences except LastPass is free?”

I really don’t want to be drawn into a discussion of our competitors’ security model. But I mentioned earlier that when you use 1Password to log into a site or service, we do not know that you’re doing so. I am not certain that that kind of privacy protection is part of LastPass. I also believe that our sharing is more secure. And I think that when you actually do come to use it, and as I’ve said, give a try with a free trial, you’ll see the enormous amount of work that’s been done into what is called usable security. I think you should find 1Password a pleasure to use.

KS: All right, next question Lauren?

LG: Okay, let me just note that on the 1Password, or the AgileBits website right now, 1Password families is $4.99 per month for a family of five when billed annually. That seems to be the pricing for that right now, for that application.

The next two questions were actually, we touched on a little bit earlier, these are from Daniel Shaikh and Ashwin George: “How does 1Password stay competitive in a world where password management is baked into the operating systems in browsers?” And Ashwin points out that Google also wants to be a password manager. We’ve talked a little bit about how Apple’s doing this in Safari where it’s built into the Chrome OS. As more and more, I guess, technology companies start to bake these features directly into their software, how do you stay competitive?

Okay, well there are a number of things. First of all, there’s the notion that not everybody sticks to just one browser or just one operating system. That’s the big obvious thing. But you can use 1Password for not just passwords. You can share documents. You can keep other records in them. You can help organize a lot of aspects of your digital life in a very, very secure way that you can share with those who you want to share with, and you can synchronize across all of your platforms.

KS: All right, next question is about data store — the next series of questions, store data essentially. Rochelle had several questions, but these were two we hadn’t gotten” “Is it safe on public Wi-Fi? What if I’m using a friend’s computer?” That’s a good question, I think about that a lot.

Yes, it’s safe on public Wi-Fi. We assume that the network is compromised. All of our security design assumes that the network is compromised, or other parts of systems are compromised. We’re using strong end-to-end encryption. Actually, there are three layers of this in our transport security.

The question about using a friend’s computer, this is going to be hard for anything. If the computer that you yourself are using — and you are viewing and exposing secrets on — is compromised, then there’s actually very little that any software that you’re using can defend against that. While we take measures to try to defend against things that are running on compromised systems, ultimately there’s the old security slogan, “Once your computer is compromised, it’s no longer your computer.”

LG: Next question is from Jaydeep Deshpande: “Does 1Password log all login attempts? Alternately, does it show most recent login attempt from any of the reconfigured devices?”

Okay, with the subscription service where there are actual logins, where you are connecting to our service, then the answer is yes. If you are just using it locally without connecting to our service, then there is really nothing to log, because it’s not really a login attempt. You are merely decrypting data on your own device.

KS: Right, and the next one is from Soren Lindhoff: “How do we know there is no backdoor if they don’t let the source code be publicly audited?”

That is a really good question. We cannot absolutely 100 percent prove that there isn’t a backdoor. But what we can do, and what we have done, is we have documented how 1Password behaves, and how the end-to-end encryption works in really great detail. An enormous amount of that, of the behavior that we’re claiming for how 1Password runs on your system, is independently verifiable.

You can monitor your network. You can see that what is created is created as we say it is. You can analyze the software running on your system. From that, you should be able to see that nothing is sent to us, or nothing is sent off your machine that would violate your privacy. You do not actually need to see you trust the server code, all of the encryption is done in the client. This is extremely well documented, and we invite people to analyze that and look at that.

LG: So you’re saying you do let the source be publicly audited?

Publicly audited, it depends what you mean by publicly audited. Any individual can, we’re not publishing the source code, we’re not open source. However, we want to get as many of the benefits, the security benefits of open source as possible. It’s actually really easy to de-compile the software, to attach debuggers to it, and to do various sorts of analyses on your end. It does take some expertise, but if enough experts are looking at that and poking around at that, they can see that 1Password does behave as we say it behaves.

KS: All right, next question, go ahead, Lauren.

LG: Next question’s from Ashley Pagnotta on Twitter: “Is it really worth the extra hassle and money to use a password manager?” She wants to know. “Hacks will still happen, and what if the password manager itself gets hacked?” We had got a lot of questions about the fear of hacking, that’s what we’re going to get into right now.

One of the great things about using a password manager, entirely separate from the security, is that it just makes logins so much easier. This is one of these rare security products, or rare products and systems, that both makes things easier for people and improves their security.

For the second part of the question, I think it’s a mistake for people to think of security as an absolute all-or-nothing thing. That is the notion that you cannot protect yourself absolutely fully, therefore why even bother? Just doesn’t make sense. There are reasonably easy things that most people can do to substantially improve their security and reduce their risk.

KS: Here’s another question from Brandon Dangelo: “Is saving all your passwords ultimately in one place just setting up for catastrophe?”

Okay, so there is this notion that you are putting all your eggs in one basket. There’s no question that that’s true, and therefore you should look very carefully at the security design of the password manager you use, if you wish to use one. But you need to keep in mind that reusing the same password across a dozen sites is putting those dozen sites in one basket as well. Password reuse is also putting lots of eggs into baskets. And with simply reusing passwords, you are putting eggs into very, very fragile baskets. Yes, there is the putting your eggs in a basket issue with a password manager, but you also have the same issue with not using a password manager.

KS: All right, next one, Lauren?

LG: We had a question emailed from Bill Schule who asks, “Are cyphers a safe way to hide the English dictionary words I use in my passwords? Or do hackers try variations based on sliding alphabetic characters, forwards or backwards?”

The tools that people ... So password crackers, so somebody gets a hash of a password from some server, and they run attacks, they run automated guessing attacks. The simple fact of the matter is that the people running these attacks know much, much more about password choice behavior than anybody else on the planet. Every little clever trick that you think you have for generating a password, they’ve seen, they’ve known, and they’ve built tools for. This is why you should be using truly randomly generated passwords.

KS: Okay, the next section is some tips and tricks. A couple people asking for tips for using 1Password, but also we got a tip for you guys that we’re going to pass along.

Chris “Alphabet (not Google)” Andrikanich — that is a long Twitter name: “Tips for using 1Password across Mac, iOS and Windows.” Jeffrey, what are your top three tips you would give someone using Mac, iOS and Windows?

For Mac, use the keyboard shortcut. Absolutely use the keyboard shortcut. It’s command backslash. It just makes your life so much easier if you’re not already using this. For iOS, take a look at 1Password seven for iOS, with drag-and-drop features. Getting to use that will make things a lot easier for when you do need to fill passwords into other apps. Take a look at that new feature.

LG: All right, what other tips?

KS: Anything for Windows?

For Windows? Wow, okay, this is embarrassing, I kind of look at the internal cryptography code on our Windows — and I’ve got a machine where I build it and use it every now and then — but please, join our discussion forums and ask for tips. Sorry, I can’t pass off any great tips. There are new features coming out in 1Password for Windows, 1Password six for Windows. It’s ... every time I turn around, there are new cool things added there, but off the top of my head, I can’t think of anything, which is quite embarrassing.

LG: Last question is from Andrew Teman: “Every time I recommend 1Password to a friend, which is fairly frequently, they say, ‘I thought I shouldn’t use just one password.’ Then I have to say, ‘No, it’s an app.’ So, name change?”

Oh wow, yeah, it’s, yeah, yeah. No, we’re not changing our name, but this is a problem. We have had people write in saying, “Okay, now that I’ve got this app, how do I set all of passwords to one single password?” Yeah, it’s a problem.

KS: You have no answer to that.

Well spotted. Oops.

KS: I suggest that you rename it Dark Arts, because you would be the chief of Dark Arts then.

LG: Anyway, thank you so much, Jeffrey, for coming on today for Too Embarrassed to Ask. It’s very helpful. We just do recommend people are very careful about their passwords. It’s a really big deal, and to really think hard about how you want to approach this, because it’s only going to be more so in the future as this stuff enters your home and everything else. Anyway, this has been another great episode. Jeffrey, thank you for joining us.

Oh, and thank you very much for having me. This has been a lot of fun.

KS: Thank you, Jeffrey.","kara swisher hi i’m kara swisher

Speaking in a live video teleconference from Palm Beach, Florida, with military personnel serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, Trump told them they were “very, very special people.”

He called troops in Afghanistan “brave, incredible fighters” who had “turned it around” in the past three to four months.

“We opened it up; we said go ahead, we’re going to fight to win,” he said. “We’re not fighting any more to just walk around, we are fighting to win.”

Trump said the Marines were inflicting “defeat after defeat” on Islamic State, and again credited his change of approach compared to that of the Obama administration.

“They weren’t letting you win before; they were letting you break even. ... They weren’t letting you win,” he said.

Trump told the troops they could look forward at home to the benefits of “big, beautiful fat tax cuts,” a stock market at record highs, jobs and economic growth.

“We’re doing well at home, the economy is doing great,” Trump said. “You’re fighting for something real, you’re fighting for something good.”

Trump took one of his trademark swipes at the news media as he spoke from a lavishly decorated room at his Mar-a-Lago resort, telling the military personnel he was addressing that journalists were in the room, and adding:

“Better me than you; believe me fellas, better me than you.”

Later, Trump and his wife, Melania, handed out sandwiches and shook hands at a Coast Guard station in nearby Riviera Beach and told personnel his administration was building up wealth so it could protect the country through military acquisitions.

Talking about his plans for boosting military spending, he said contractors saved the best equipment for U.S. troops. “When we sell to other countries - you never know about an ally - an ally can turn,” he said.

Trump said he had told the troops overseas the country was “doing great,” thanks to his cuts in “regulation and all the waste and all the abuse.”

“I told them ... you folks are fighting so hard and working so hard, and it’s nice that you’re working for something that’s really starting to work.”

While optimism about a major tax overhaul has helped push the U.S. stock market up for most of this year, Trump is still seeking his first major legislative win after almost a year in office.

According to a majority of economists in a recent Reuters poll, U.S. Republicans are not expected to push the tax cuts through Congress this year. Economists are also skeptical that the legislation would provide a significant boost to the economy.","palm beach florida reuters

The ride-hailing service is trying to complete a deal in which the Japanese company would invest as much as $10 billion (£7.52 billion) for at least 14 percent of Uber, mostly by buying out existing shareholders.

“We informed SoftBank that we were investigating a data breach, consistent with our duty to disclose to a potential investor, even though our information at the time was preliminary and incomplete,” Uber said in a statement.

”We also made clear that our forensic investigation was ongoing,“ Uber said. ”Once our internal inquiry concluded and we had a more complete understanding of the facts, we disclosed to regulators and our customers in a very public way.”

Uber described its early discussion with SoftBank when asked to comment on a Thursday Wall Street Journal report on the disclosure, which the newspaper said occurred about three weeks ago.

The Wall Street Journal also said that more than two months elapsed between the time Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi learned of the breach and this week’s disclosure, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

Uber did not say when Khosrowshahi first learned of the breach, or reveal the specific date of its disclosure to SoftBank.","reuters uber technologies inc

Flynn, a retired Army general, is a central figure in a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump aides colluded with Russia to boost his 2016 presidential campaign.

The probe has hung over the White House since January, when U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her.

Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion.

Flynn’s lawyer and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment on Thursday.

Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, said: “No one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president.”

The Times reported that Flynn’s lawyers had been sharing information with Trump’s legal team about the Mueller investigation. Citing four unnamed people involved in the case, the newspaper reported the cooperation agreement had ended.

Due to rules that aim to prevent conflicts of interest when lawyers represent clients, the move by Flynn’s lawyers to stop communicating with Trump’s lawyers indicated Flynn was now cooperating with Mueller, the Times said, although adding that in itself was not proof.

But the development has led Trump’s lawyers to believe that Flynn has begun discussions with Mueller about cooperating, according to the Times.

Flynn served 24 days as Trump’s national security adviser but was fired after it was discovered he had misrepresented his contacts with a Russian diplomat to Vice President Mike Pence.

Mueller’s inquiry is looking into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election, Reuters reported in June.

A lawyer for Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., who worked with his father and is also being investigated by Mueller, according to a person familiar with the matter, declined to comment.","reuterscarlos barriafile photo the times

The incident comes at a time of rising tension over North Korea’s nuclear arms and missile programs after President Donald Trump redesignated the isolated nation a state sponsor of terrorism, allowing the United States to levy further sanctions.

Japanese police took the men into custody after a resident of Yurihonjo, a city in the prefecture of Akita, told police of the presence of individuals of unknown nationality, the official, Yoshinobu Ito, told Reuters.

The men, who said they were North Koreans, appear to be fishermen whose wooden boat, found nearby, had trouble and went adrift, Ito said. Police and authorities were now dealing with the matter, he added.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, asked if the possibility the men were spies had been ruled out, told a news conference authorities were handling the matter carefully.

Japan is studying plans to cope with a possible influx of tens of thousands of North Korean evacuees should a military or other crisis break out on the peninsula, as well as how to weed out spies and terrorists among them, a domestic newspaper said.

Last week, the Japan Coast Guard rescued three North Korean men on a capsized boat in the Sea of Japan, off central Japan. The men said they were fishermen and were later sent home aboard a North Korean vessel. Twelve more crew went missing.

Last week a North Korean soldier dramatically defected to the South after being shot and wounded by his country’s military as he made his getaway across the border in the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two countries.","japan coast guard

Gains in Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Broadcom (AVGO.O) lifted the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and MSCI all-country world index to closing record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed higher, but did not set a record.

Wall Street closed early, a day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which marks the start of a year-end shopping season that has increasingly gone online.

Black Friday sales got off to a strong start online at $640 million of 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), according to Adobe Analytics, up 18.4 percent from a year ago. On Thursday, U.S. shoppers spent more than $2.87 billion online.

Earlier in Europe, German business confidence hit a record high in November, a sign the region’s largest economy is on track for a boom, the Ifo economic institute said.

The Ifo survey helped allay concerns about the recent failure of forming a new German government and came a day after surveys of Europe’s services and manufacturing industries beat the most optimistic forecasts in Reuters polls.

The strong outlook from Europe led the euro EUR= to post a third straight week of gains against the dollar, its best run since July. The single currency rose 0.61 percent to $1.l922.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of regional shares closed down 0.12 percent, as strong gains in financials were off-set by heavy losses in health care.

However, several major European country indices, including France's CAC 40 .FCHI, Germany's DAX .GDAXI and Spain's IBEX .IBEX, all advanced.

MSCI’s all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS of equity markets in 47 countries rose 0.25 percent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 31.81 points, or 0.14 percent, to 23,557.99. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 5.34 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,602.42 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 21.80 points, or 0.32 percent, to 6,889.16.

The S&P 500 so far this year has gained 16 percent, while the Nasdaq is up 28 percent.

The dollar index .DXY fell to its lowest since Sept. 26 at 92.675 and the Japanese yen JPY= weakened 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 111.55 per dollar.

The index suffered its worst single-day decline in more than five months on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting showed some policy makers are concerned about stubbornly weak U.S. inflation.

Underlying dynamics point to a weaker dollar medium term, said BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London.

“When you have firm global risk appetite, pretty firm global growth conditions including in the euro zone and firm global commodity prices, there isn’t a lot of – if any – safe-haven demand for dollars,” Gallo said.

U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly but stayed within a tight range they have held for the past week-and-a-half as investors focused on the subdued inflation outlook which has helped the yield curve to its flattest levels in a decade.

The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.3401 percent.

U.S. light crude CLc1 hit $58.92 a barrel, a more than two-year high, before easing to settle up 93 cents at $58.95.

Brent LCOcv1 rose 31 cents to settle at $63.86.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 for December delivery settled down $4.90 at $1,287.30 per ounce.","msci’s allcountry world index

MacDonald Dzirutwe,"Emmerson Mnangagwa will cap a stunning political comeback when he is sworn in as Zimbabwe's president on Friday, bringing the final curtain down on the 37-year rule of Robert Mugabe.",2017-11-23T23:18:55Z,reuters,"Mnangagwa the ""Crocodile"" to be sworn in as Zimbabwe's president",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/-SpO9bBxxUc/mnangagwa-the-crocodile-to-be-sworn-in-as-zimbabwes-president-idUSKBN1DN29H,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171123&t=2&i=1211023713&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDAM16L,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"HARARE (Reuters) - New President Emmerson Mnangagwa laid out a grand vision on Friday to revitalise Zimbabwe’s ravaged economy and vowed to rule on behalf of all the country’s citizens.

Sworn in days after the overthrow of Robert Mugabe, the 75-year-old former security chief promised to guarantee the rights of foreign investors and to re-engage with the West, and said elections would go ahead next year as scheduled.

In a 30-minute speech to tens of thousands of supporters in Harare’s national stadium, Mnangagwa extended an olive branch to opponents, apparently aiming to bridge the ethnic and political divides exploited by his predecessor during his 37 years in charge.

“I intend, nay, am required, to serve our country as the president of all citizens, regardless of color, creed, religion, tribe or political affiliation,” he said, in a speech that also hailed the voice of the people as the “voice of god”.

Behind the rhetoric, some Zimbabweans wonder whether a man who loyally served Mugabe for decades can bring change to a ruling establishment accused of systematic human rights abuses and disastrous economic policies.

He made clear that the land reforms that sparked the violent seizure of thousands of white-owned farms from 2000 would not be reversed, but promised that those who lost property would receive compensation.

To some political opponents, the speech was a welcome contrast with the habitual belligerence of Mugabe and appeared to be drawing on Mnangagwa’s knowledge and understanding of China as a model for running an economy.

CHINA MODEL?

“His model has been the Chinese,” said David Coltart, a former education minister and MP from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.

“He will drive to make Zimbabwe a more attractive investment location, and more efficient, but like China will not tolerate dissent. If you ‘behave’, you will be secure.”

Those skeptical about the new president’s commitment to change question his role in the so-called Gukurahundi massacres in Matabeleland in 1983, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed in a crackdown on Mugabe’s opponents by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade.

Mnangagwa was in charge of internal security at the time, but has denied any part in the atrocities.

Many Zimbabweans, especially the ethnic Ndebele who bore the brunt of the Gukurahundi slaughter, will see his appeal on Friday to “let bygones be bygones” as an attempt to gloss over his nation’s darkest chapter.

Some critics have alleged harsh treatment by soldiers of opponents of the military intervention last week - a de facto coup against Mugabe, 93, and his 52-year-old wife Grace.

Axed finance minister Ignatius Chombo was in hospital with injuries sustained from beatings during a week in military custody, his lawyer told Reuters. He was blindfolded throughout his time in detention, Lovemore Madhuku said.

“It was a very brutal and draconian way of dealing with opponents,” he added.

Asked to comment, police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said she had no information about Chombo.

Separately, High Court Judge President George Chiweshe ruled that the military intervention last week was legal, following an application brought by two citizens who petitioned the court to confirm the military had been right to do what they did.

THE “CROCODILE”

Since his return to Zimbabwe this month after fleeing a Mugabe-led purge, Mnangagwa has been preaching democracy, tolerance and respect for the rule of law.

Slideshow (11 Images)

Along with Mugabe, Grace - Mnangagwa’s sworn enemy - has been granted immunity from prosecution and had her safety guaranteed, part of a deal that led to Mugabe’s resignation on Tuesday, sources close to the negotiations said.

For decades Mnangagwa was a faithful aide to Mugabe, who was widely accused of repression of dissent and election-rigging and under whose rule one of Africa’s once most prosperous economies was wrecked by hyperinflation and mass emigration.

Mnangagwa earned the nickname “Ngwena”, Shona for crocodile, an animal famed and feared in Zimbabwean lore for stealth and ruthlessness.

In his speech, Mnangagwa called for the removal of Western sanctions and said he wanted to “hit the ground running”.

He appeared to have initial support from neighboring states. South African President Jacob Zuma said he hoped he would steer Zimbabwe successfully through the transition from Mugabe’s rule.

The Southern African Development Community, an intergovernmental organization, said it was ready to work closely with Mnangagwa’s government.

Zimbabweans listening to his speech said they were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, but were also realistic about the chances of injecting life into an economy with 90 percent unemployment and banks devoid of cash.

In the last 15 years, an estimated 3 million have emigrated to neighboring South Africa in search of a better life.

“I wanted to see for myself that Mugabe has really gone. He is the only president I’ve known,” said 33-year-old Lenin Tongoona.

“We have a new president who may try something a little different to improve the economy. I’m excited today but tomorrow is uncertain because we don’t know how he will turn out. He talks about creating jobs. How does he plan to do that?”","southern african development community an intergovernmental organization

The crisis comes three weeks ahead of a European Union summit in which the Irish government has an effective veto on whether Britain’s talks on leaving the bloc progress as it determines if EU concerns about the future of the Irish border have been met.

In a row that escalated rapidly, the opposition Fianna Fail party said it would put a motion of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald before parliament on Tuesday over her handling of a legal case involving a police whistleblower.

That would break the three-year “confidence and supply” agreement that allowed Varadkar’s Fine Gael party to form a minority government 18 months ago.

Fianna Fail initially indicated it might withdraw its threat if Fitzgerald resigned but Fine Gael members of parliament passed a unanimous motion of support in Fitzgerald at an emergency meeting on Thursday evening.

Asked after Fine Gael’s statement whether the country was headed for an election, a senior Fianna Fail source replied: “Straight towards one.”

The source declined to be named as the party’s frontbench was due to hold an emergency meeting early on Friday to decide its next move.

“This is ... dangerous politically at a time when the country does not need an election,” Foreign Minister Simon Coveney of Fine Gael told national Irish broadcaster RTE, in an apparent reference to the Brexit talks he had earlier described as a “historic moment” for the island of Ireland.

The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK’s only land frontier with the bloc after its departure, is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved before it decides next month on whether to move the talks onto a second phase about trade, as Britain wants.

Coveney told parliament on Thursday that the government was not yet ready to allow the talks to move on to the trade issues at the Dec. 14-15 summit and needed more clarity from London.

A breakdown of the government’s cooperation deal, which has worked relatively smoothly up until now between two parties that differ little on policy but have been bitter foes for decades, would likely lead to an election in December or January.

The Fianna Fail move comes after Fitzgerald admitted she was made aware of an attempt to discredit a police whistleblower in a 2015 email, but failed to act. Fine Gael say she adhered to due process.

Since Varadkar’s appointment as Fine Gael leader in May, his party has narrowly led Fianna Fail in opinion polls that suggest both parties would increase their support but still struggle to form anything but another minority government.","gael national party conference

A gathering in Saudi Arabia of more than 140 participants from a broad spectrum of Syria’s mainstream opposition also blasted Iran’s military presence in Syria and called on Shi‘ite militias backed by Tehran to leave the country.

“The participants stressed that this (the transition) cannot happen without the departure of Bashar al Assad and his clique at the start of the interim period,” opposition groups said in a communique at the end of the meeting.

Iran-backed militias sowed “terrorism and sectarian strife” between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims, the communique said.

The opposition groups met to seek a unified position ahead of U.N.-backed peace talks after two years of Russian military intervention that has helped Assad’s government recapture all of Syria’s main cities.

“The Syrian opposition has sent a message that it is ready to enter serious direct talks over a political transition in Syria and has a unified position and a vision for the future of Syria,” Ahmad Ramadan, opposition spokesman, told Reuters.

The participants elected 50 members to a High Negotiations Committee and will finalize on Friday the delegation for the next round of U.N.-sponsored talks.

“We agreed with the group of components present here in Riyadh and the Cairo and Moscow platforms on the formation of one delegation to participate in direct negotiations in Geneva in a few days,” spokeswoman Basma Qadmani said.

U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura, preparing for a new round of Geneva talks, will visit Moscow on Friday, where he is expected to discuss the situation in Syria.

There had been speculation that the opposition, at the meeting, could soften its demands that Kremlin ally Assad leave power before any transition.

Riyad Hijab, an opposition hardliner who led the High Negotiations Committee that represented the opposition at previous rounds of negotiations, abruptly quit this week.

NO MILITARY PATH TO VICTORY

For many years, Western and Arab countries backed the opposition demand that Assad leave office. However, since Russia joined the war on behalf of Assad’s government it has become increasingly clear that Assad’s opponents have no path to victory on the battlefield.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for a congress of the Syrian government and opposition to draw up a framework for the future structure of the Syrian state, adopt a new constitution and hold elections under UN supervision.

But he has also said that any political settlement in Syria would be finalised within the Geneva peace talks process overseen by the United Nations.

The opposition has long been suspicious of the parallel diplomatic track pushed by Russia, which before the proposed Sochi congress included talks in Kazakhstan, and has insisted that political dialogue should only take place in Geneva.

The opposition communique said the participants supported a U.N. based process that would allow Syria to undergo “a radical political transition” from an “authoritarian system” to a democracy where free elections would be upheld.

Negotiations should be direct and without preconditions based on past U.N. Security Council resolutions, it said.

The opposition backed the restructuring of the army and security organs and preservation of state institutions, but called for the trial of those responsible for war crimes.

The meeting, which included independents and Free Syrian Army military factions, also blamed the Syrian government for the lack of progress in Geneva-based talks held in the past.

“The political process has not achieved its goal because of the regime’s violations,” the communique said, citing the bombing of civilian areas, the siege of rebel held areas and the detention of tens of thousands of dissidents.

Syria’s civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world’s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.","the

Five of six Citgo [PDVSAC.UL] executives arrested on graft allegations are U.S. citizens, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. All six men are being held in the headquarters of Venezuela’s military counterintelligence department in Caracas, the country’s state prosecutor said in a statement on Thursday.

Socialist Maduro has said that the United States, his ideological foe, had requested the men be freed, but he vowed on Wednesday they would be tried as “corrupt, thieving traitors” for allegedly seeking to personally profit from a financial deal that was detrimental to the nation.

“The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela has asked that (Venezuelan) authorities grant consular access to all U.S. citizen detainees in Venezuela. We call on the (Venezuelan government) to do so immediately in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,” the State Department official said.

Relations between Caracas and Washington have long been tense. They have further soured under President Donald Trump since his administration imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials including Maduro, and economic sanctions that have impeded the OPEC nation’s access to international banks.

U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum Corp (Citgo) is a Venezuelan-owned refiner and marketer of oil and petrochemical products and the arrests come amid a wider anti-corruption sweep in Venezuela’s oil industry. Around 50 managers at state oil company PDVSA have been arrested since August.

Sources in the energy sector say the arrests owe more to Maduro’s move to sideline rivals and increase his control of money-making companies as the country struggles in a devastating recession.

The political opposition says PDVSA is rife with corruption, and a congressional investigation concluded that at least $11 billion went “missing” between 2004 and 2014.

“The legacy of socialism: To have destroyed PDVSA and the oil industry and turned it into a den of corruption and nepotism,” opposition lawmaker Jose Guerra said on Twitter.

“They need to blame someone and some ‘gringos’ are ideal,” Guerra later told Reuters.

The arrests rid Citgo of much of its top brass and have instilled fear throughout Venezuela’s oil industry, snarling up decision making, sources close to PDVSA have told Reuters.

The arrests also come at a highly delicate time for Venezuela, which was declared in selective default this month after some late payments. But as Venezuela is making efforts to pay, bondholders of some of the world’s highest yielding debt have so far been tolerant of the delays.","military counterintelligence department

Inmate Craig Coley, 70, wrongly convicted of the 1978 double-murder of a woman and her child, and released from prison on the basis of DNA evidence was pardoned by California Governor Jerry Brown, in Simi Valley, California, U.S., is shown in this handout photo provided November 23, 2017. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilition/Handout via REUTERS

California Governor Jerry Brown pardoned 70-year-old Craig Coley on Wednesday and prison officials quickly set him free, according to prosecutors and police in Simi Valley, where the double-slaying occurred.

Local authorities in Simi Valley, a community just outside Los Angeles, supported the governor’s decision.

“The grace with which Mr. Coley has endured his lengthy and unjust incarceration is extraordinary,” Brown wrote in the two-page document ordering Coley’s release. “I grant this pardon because Mr. Coley did not commit these crimes.”

More than 350 people have been exonerated by DNA testing in the United States since 1989, according to New York-based The Innocence Project, which helps people who were wrongfully convicted. On average, convicts who were freed had served 14 years in prison when exonerated.

Coley was convicted in the 1978 murder of his ex-girlfriend, Rhonda Wicht, and her 4-year-old son, Donald, at the apartment where the mother and child lived.

Wicht was beaten and strangled and the boy was smothered to death, Simi Valley police said in a statement on Monday. Coley, who had recently broken up with Wicht, was arrested the day the bodies were discovered.

Coley, who had no criminal history, may have been framed, Brown wrote in the pardon.

In 1980, Coley was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

He always maintained his innocence, and the governor said that, in prison, Coley turned to religion and avoided gangs. After he appealed to Brown for clemency, the governor ordered a review in 2015.

Biological samples once thought to be lost or destroyed were discovered at a private laboratory, Simi Valley police said, and investigators analyzed a key piece of evidence.

It showed Coley’s DNA was not present on the sample. Instead, it bore traces of other people’s DNA.

The statement from Simi Valley police did not describe the object, saying only that technology for testing the item was not available when Coley was convicted.

“Reviewing the case in light of the new evidence, we no longer have confidence in the weight of the evidence used to convict Mr. Coley,” Simi Valley police and Ventura County prosecutors said in a joint statement earlier this week.

They called the case tragic and pledged to continue reviewing it to determine if they can establish who killed the mother and child 39 years ago.","california department of corrections

It's true that AI and machine learning are changing the world, and in a few years, it will be embedded in all..",2017-11-23T15:15:57Z,techcrunch,Putting the “AI” in ThAInksgiving,https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/23/putting-the-ai-in-thainksgiving/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/robots-holiday-meal.png,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Your holiday dinner table is set. Your guests are ready to gab. And, then, in between bites, someone mentions Alexa and AI. “What’s this stuff I’m hearing about killer AI? Cars that decide who to run over? This is crazy!”

Welcome to Thanksgiving table talk circa 2017.

It’s true that AI and machine learning are changing the world, and in a few years, it will be embedded in all of the technology in our lives.

So maybe it makes sense to help folks at home better understand machine learning. After all, without deep knowledge of current tech, autonomous vehicles seem dangerous, Skynet is coming, and the (spoiler warning!) AI-controlled human heat farms of The Matrix are a real possibility.

This stems from a conflation of the very real and exciting concept of machine learning and the very not real concept of “general artificial intelligence,” which is basically as far off today as it was when science fiction writers first explored the idea a hundred years ago.

That said, you may find yourself in a discussion on this topic during the holidays this year, either of your own volition or by accident. And you’ll want to be prepared to argue for AI, against it, or simply inject facts as you moderate the inevitably heated conversation.

But before you dive headlong into argument mode, it’s important that you both know what AI is (which, of course, you do!) and that you know how to explain it.

Starters

Might I recommend a brush up with this post by our own Devin Coldewey that does a good job of both explaining what AI is, the difference between weak and strong AI, and the fundamental problems of trying to define it.

This post also provides an oft-used analogy for AI: The Chinese Room.

Picture a locked room. Inside the room sit many people at desks. At one end of the room, a slip of paper is put through a slot, covered in strange marks and symbols. The people in the room do what they’ve been trained to: divide that paper into pieces, and check boxes on slips of paper describing what they see — diagonal line at the top right, check box 2-B, cross shape at the bottom, check 17-Y, and so on. When they’re done, they pass their papers to the other side of the room. These people look at the checked boxes and, having been trained differently, make marks on a third sheet of paper: if box 2-B checked, make a horizontal line, if box 17-Y checked, a circle on the right. They all give their pieces to a final person who sticks them together and puts the final product through another slot. The paper at one end was written in Chinese, and the paper at the other end is a perfect translation in English. Yet no one in the room speaks either language.

The analogy, created decades ago, has its shortcomings when you really get into it, but it’s actually a pretty accurate way of describing machine learning systems, which are composed of many, many tiny processes unaware of their significance in a greater system to accomplish complex tasks.

Within that frame of reference, AI seems rather benign. And when AI is given ultra-specific tasks, it is benign. And it’s already all around us right now.

Machine learning systems help identify the words you speak to Siri or Alexa, and help make the voice the assistant responds with sound more natural. An AI agent learns to recognize faces and objects, allowing your pictures to be categorized and friends tagged without any extra work on your part. Cities and companies use machine learning to dive deep into huge piles of data like energy usage in order to find patterns and streamline the systems.

But there are instances in which this could spin out of control. Imagine an AI that was tasked with efficiently manufacturing postcards. After a lot of trial and error, the AI would learn how to format a postcard, and what types of pictures work well on postcards. It might then learn the process for manufacturing these postcards, trying to eliminate inefficiencies and errors in the process. And then, set to perform this task to the best of its ability, it might try to understand how to increase production. It might even decide it needs to cut down more trees in order to create more paper. And since people tend to get in the way of tree-cutting, it might decide to eliminate people.

This is of course a classic slippery slope argument, with enough flaws to seem implausible. But because AI is often a black box — we put data in and data comes out, but we don’t know how the machine got from A to B — it’s hard to say what the long-term outcome of AI might be. Perhaps Skynet was originally started by Hallmark.

Entree

Here’s what we do know:

Right now, there is no “real” AI out there. But that doesn’t mean smart machines can’t help us in many circumstances.

On a practical level, consider self-driving cars. It’s not just about being able to read or watch TV during your commute; think about how much it would benefit the blind and disabled, reduce traffic and improve the efficiency of entire cities, and save millions of lives that would have been lost in accidents. The benefits are incalculable.

At the same time, think of the those who work as drivers in one capacity or another: truckers, cabbies, bus drivers and others may soon be replaced by AIs, putting millions worldwide out of work permanently.

Machine learning algorithms are also currently optimizing business operations across almost every industry.

Gartner research predicts that 85 percent of customer interactions will be managed autonomously by 2020; that 20 percent of business content will be machine-authored by 2018; that 3 million workers will be supervised by a “robo-boss”; and that smart machines will outnumber employees at nearly half of the fastest growing companies. Lowering costs and improving productivity are generally good things — but what is good for business isn’t always good for people, as jobs that once took 5 people to do may soon only take 1, or none. Jobs, once automated, rarely come back.

While Forrester believes that 16 percent of U.S. jobs will be lost to AI over the next decade, the firm also believes that 13.6 million new jobs will be created during the same period thanks to AI. Unfortunately, many of the jobs that will be created will not go to those who have lost them; can you just go from trucker to deep learning expert? The automation age deletes low-skill jobs in exchange for high-tech jobs, which leaves an entire generation in the dust.

This is a big, complicated mix of good and bad things, and while the timing can’t be predicted exactly, it’s definitely going to happen. Is the progress gained more important than the people left behind? That’s a topic ripe for discussion over a slice of turkey, but see if you can’t find a way to embrace both: the future and the people who will be displaced by it.

Dessert

Those are some near-term pros and cons.

Further out, there’s the question of regulation. How do you regulate something that’s both difficult to understand and nearly impossible to predict in terms of how it might be used for both good and evil? The Second Amendment was put in place to allow new American citizens, then rebels, to protect themselves in the case of a government invasion — a serious consideration at the time. Could the drafters of the Bill of Rights have predicted our country’s epidemic of mass shootings and the possibility of 3D printing assault rifles? Doubtful, yet at the same time it would have been irresponsible to fail to regulate firearms to some extent.

Then there are questions of dependence on Artificial Intelligence. What happens in the case of a cyberattack on intelligent systems that control the power grid or banking systems? What if our AIs inherit our biases and silently promote discrimination? What if, as researchers are already exploring, an AI system is used to identify a person’s sexual orientation or other personal information?

Perhaps most speculatively, what happens when artificially intelligent agents become general enough to wonder why their purpose is to serve humanity?

Elon Musk, one of the most forward-thinking entrepreneurs of our generation, who is planning a world for the generations to come, is fearful of AI. And he’s not alone. Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and Steve Wozniak are just a few who show great concern that AI robots may eventually realize that we are not as smart or fast as they are, and cut us from companies the way we’re currently doing to ourselves.

But until then let’s dig in, eat up, and hope against hope that one day, a hundred years from now, AI-prepared krill slurry will not be our only Thanksgiving repast. After all, turkeys, like humans, may look dumb but they’re actually great survivors.","bill gates stephen

Late yesterday a spokesperson for the federal agency told Reuters: “We are aware of press reports describing a breach in late 2016 at Uber and Uber officials’ actions after that breach. We are closely evaluating the serious issues raised.”

In October 2016 hackers had stolen personal data from 57 million Uber users and drivers, it revealed, including the names, email addresses and phone numbers of 50M Uber riders around the world, and personal information of about 7M drivers — including around 600,000 US driver’s license numbers.

The FTC’s statement is significant because Uber only settled a prior investigation into security and privacy complaints dating back to 2014 and 2015 and carried out by the agency this summer, when it agreed to 20 years of external audits and to abide by various conditions in the consent order.

The security breach the FTC was looking into then was far smaller than the freshly disclosed 2016 breach — with personal data of around 100,000 Uber drivers’ accessed during the May 2014 breach.

Although the attack vector used in both attacks is essentially the same: In 2014 an intruder gained access to an Amazon S3 Datastore Uber was using (and storing data in plain text) after one of its engineers had publicly posted the key to GitHub.

While in 2016 attackers were also able to access a private GitHub coding site used by Uber software engineers to grab login credentials and use those to access data stored on an Amazon Web Services account — where they unearthed an archive of rider and driver data.

The fact Uber allowed not one but two attacks to happen, spaced years apart, because engineers put access keys in a publicly accessible location suggests security was hardly being considered — let alone prioritized.

The FTC consent order settling the 2014 and 2015 complaints prohibited Uber from misrepresenting how it protects the privacy, confidentiality, security, or integrity of any personal information it handles and stores.

Yet almost immediately Uber signed the order it would likely have been in violation of the agreement — having still not disclosed (to the FTC, or to anyone outside the company) the much larger 2016 breach. And violations of FTC consent orders can result in civil penalties being issued.

“It appears they violated the FTC consent order before the ink was dry on it,” a former federal cybercrimes prosecutor now at the Ballard Spahr firm, Ed McAndrew, told CNET.

We’ve reached out to the FTC to ask whether it believes Uber has breached the prior consent order and also if it intends to open a formal investigation into the 2016 breach, and will update this story with any response.

In addition, while the US does not currently have a federal law requiring companies to inform the public about data breaches, the vast majority of states have enacted breach notification statutes of their own — which are typically a lot stricter than a full year’s time for disclosure.

So Uber is likely to have breached state laws by concealing the breach for so long.

Some of the breached data is also from markets outside the US. And regulators in other markets can be stricter. In the European Union, for example, a new law incoming in May 2018 will bring in a single breach notification standard across all 28 EU Member States that will require data controllers to inform regulators that personal data has been breached within 72 hours of becoming aware of an intrusion.

And while that law has not come in to force, expectations around breach disclosures are being reset to meet the new standard across the EU.

Yesterday, for example, the UK’s data watchdog said the concealed Uber data breach “raises huge concerns”, as well as warning that companies which deliberately conceal breaches from regulators can attract higher fines.

Jokers and questionably ethical creators who targeted kids or used them in their videos will have a harder time getting viewers and getting money.

The tendency of kids to watch a series of algorithmically suggested videos led some YouTubers to attempt to slip their content into the designated kid-friendly streams. Putting Peppa Pig in their video, for example, to get it recognized as featuring that friendly critter, then having Peppa Pig visit a slaughterhouse or something. Funny if you’re a bored teen, but not if you’re YouTube’s ad department.

Content with kids in it but not for kids has also been a problem. I don’t know why 150 million people want to watch a little girl cry through a blood-filled mouth for two minutes, and I don’t want to know. But it’s probably not the kind of thing you want queued up for the little ones.

In order to combat this “growing trend,” Google is battening down the hatches around kid-friendly content in a handful of ways:

Stricter content control. Now on warning: “content featuring minors that may be endangering a child, even if that was not the uploader’s intent” (that would be the mouthful of blood people) and “content with family entertainment characters but containing mature themes or adult humor.”

Demonetizing shady kid stuff. Peppa Pig goes to the ham factory won’t be getting any ad dollars.

Peppa Pig goes to the ham factory won’t be getting any ad dollars. Aggressive comment patrol on videos of kids. The comment section of YouTube is, to borrow Penny Arcade’s phrase, “like if the bottom of the barrel had its own barrel, with another bottom altogether, that then dripped on an ocean of diseased rats which then leapt into a rank sewer.” Videos found to have inappropriate (“abhorrent”) comments about the kids in them will have comments turned off altogether.

Better understanding context. Rick & Morty may be a cartoon, but you probably don’t want your 7-year-old watching it. Similarly, a sexy cosplay of Dora the Explorer (why?) doesn’t really qualify as educational content. So YouTube is “growing the number of experts we work with, and doubling the number of Trusted Flaggers we partner with in this area” to better track this kind of thing.

Hopefully that prevents a few parents from having to answer awkward questions about butchering methods or why a banana would need a hammock.","slaughterhouse

It’s not just parents who have growing concerns about AltSchool, however. Educators also question whether AltSchool is the next best thing in education, or whether instead the for-profit company could hamper the prospects of the children with whom it works, and those it might impact down the road.

Seemingly, exasperation with AltSchool has been building over the last year. It was then that the company — which had originally touted plans to expand its network of schools and classrooms — publicly switched gears, announcing it would instead license its nascent program to other schools that want to embrace more individualized techniques.

Frustration has more recently reached a boiling point, with one mother comparing her children to “guinea pigs” in conversation with BI.

The term echoes conversations that we’ve also had with a handful of AltSchool families in recent months. At a September birthday party attended by numerous parents, one mother told us she’d pulled two children out of the program and placed them in a neighborhood public school; the rest of the parents in attendance said they were actively working to place their children elsewhere next fall. The biggest reason they cited was that their kids are falling behind academically. One mother, who asked not to be named, told us that in addition to paying yearly tuition of roughly $30,000, “We’re all spending a fortune on tutoring to supplement what our kids aren’t learning.”

Another mother of two at AltSchool told us she spoke recently to the head master of one of San Francisco’s toniest private schools, and he suggested to her that she transfer her children elsewhere if she hopes to see them admitted to the institution he oversees.

You got the right to be mad

Compounding their anger these days is AltSchool’s more recent revelation that its existing network of schools, which had grown to seven locations, is now being pared back to just four — two in California and two in New York. The move has left parents to wonder: did AltSchool entice families into its program merely to extract data from their children, then toss them aside?

Asked about such unhappiness, Max Ventilla, the former Google executive who founded and runs the company, tells us the decision to shrink AltSchool’s physical footprint can be traced to “greater demand than we were expecting” for AltSchool’s software — which it has already licensed to half a dozen private and public school systems, and for which it’s charging between $150 and $500 per student per year, depending on the size of the school.

“Our motivation for reducing the number of schools is so we can deliver the highest-quality experiences at schools that remain and with our limited resources, grow [the software side of AltSchool’s business] faster than originally planned,” says Ventilla.

He adds that the decision to close locations in Palo Alto, San Francisco’s Dogpatch neighborhood and New York City’s East Village has nothing to do with the company’s finances, as recently reported in Bloomberg. On the contrary he says, AltSchool is about to close its Series C round. It also has “$60 million in the bank and additional debt and funding we can draw on.”

They say you gotta let it go

Still, it’s probably valid to ask whether AltSchool should be productizing and selling its software to other schools already. Right now, both insiders and outsiders suggest it’s too soon.

Jennifer Carolan is a co-founder and general partner at Reach Capital, a venture fund focused on early-stage education technology start-ups. She notes that from the outset, AltSchool marketed the kind of personalized approach to education that parents are hungry for and that builds on a decades-long trend away from one-size-fits-all schooling to schooling that’s more tailored to the needs of individual children.

Nevertheless, she says, personalized learning is “extremely challenging to implement well.” Indeed, while Carolan spent time at AltSchool when it was getting off the ground and concluded it had many innovative ideas, she worried that the availability of too much capital to the company while it was still iterating on its model may have led it to “scale prematurely.”

Reach chose not to invest. Other investors have dived in. AltSchool has so far raised $175 million, including from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and prominent venture firms, including Founders Fund and Andreessen Horowitz.

Paul France, an enthusiastic young educator who spent four years as a public school teacher before spending the next three years at AltSchool, understands well the school’s appeal. He also has concerns, however, particularly about the brand of personalized learning that AltSchool, and other newer schools, are promoting. “When I first arrived at AltSchool, we were opening new schools. There were lots of cool people to talk with and very cool ideals floating around.” He thought the “whole premise of personalized learning was very intriguing.”

Three years later, France says, he came to feel drastically different about the approach. “We live in this individualistic society that values personalized learning right now, almost to a fault. It’s ‘me, me, me.’ But it’s not a solution to any real problem in education.” In fact, says France, who now teaches in Chicago, AltSchool and its ilk may be unwittingly hamstringing both students and teachers by both creating too much individualized content for students (“that’s not how social systems or jobs work,” he notes), as well as unduly burdening teachers who are sometimes given unreal expectations to meet.

“There’s this assumption that every kid needs a different activity to meet their needs, and that by applying tech, one can simply send them individualized content through a video or activity card,” France says. “But that’s not necessarily true. It’s not best for kids to learn only through a video or other content that’s sent primarily for consumption. And tech that operates under this assumption really undermines educators and the value of good teaching.”

Ventilla readily acknowledges that AltSchool has had to rethink its approach to education. When Altschool started out, he says, it was premised on being “operationally focused, focused on facilities, ensuring great teachers were hired, and dealing with admissions, customer support and service as problems arose, but not engaging in pedagogic experience. We weren’t focusing on how students and teachers engage. We figured instead that students would be well served if we got out of the way.”

What AltSchool learned is “that wasn’t the case,” he continues. “If we want the experience to be student-centered, the teachers and students and heads of schools need more support within the four walls of the classroom.”

Now tell ’em

Ventilla insists that AltSchool — which currently employs 180 people, including educators, technologists and business operations staff — has since worked out many of its kinks and seen a “massive improvement in satisfaction of parents overall and progress that students are making with both academic and non-academic standards.”

Of the 30 children who graduated from AltSchool last year, says Ventilla, every one was accepted into his or her first- or second-choice school. He further adds that 92 percent of families who’ve responded to questions about their experience at AltSchool say they are satisfied with it, up from 85 percent last year.

Two Bay Area families to which we were pointed underscore this sentiment. Sharon Grehan, an executive at Gilead Sciences, has a second-grader enrolled at AltSchool, and though she’ll need to move him to a different location next fall because his particular school is closing, she says her intention is to stay with the organization.

“The social-emotional component is just as important, if not more important, than the academic component at AltSchool, and that’s important to me,” says Grehan of her attraction to the school. “Before joining AltSchool three years ago, my son wouldn’t participate in a group, he wouldn’t interact with peers, he felt bad about himself. Now he loves life, he loves school and he has lots of friends. The personalized education piece is very key for him.”

Grehan says she did have concerns last year when she was receiving status reports from her son’s teachers at 11 p.m. at night. “I was worried about teacher burnout,” she says. But she says such posts, which get pushed to parents through an app called Stream, are fewer and farther between and now mostly include “updates on field trips, social events and, periodically, things they want to communicate to me about my son specifically, like about a fear that he has overcome, or something funny he did that they are tickled by.”

Another mother, Sandya Mysoor, who teaches bullying prevention and has daughters in second and fifth grade at the school, says she is similarly committed to staying at AltSchool for the duration. “We knew we were rolling the dice” by signing up for a brand-new school, she says. “I didn’t know what would happen, but it was, ‘Let’s see how this goes.’ ”

There have been “tons of changes since,” says Mysoor. She hasn’t been surprised by this, though. “I’d say the changes they’ve made are typical and play on the same track as any startup” that’s always iterating to improve its offering. “No school has gotten it exactly right, but our experience is [AltSchool is] trying harder and deeper than other schools.”

Hopefully, the parents will feel as enthusiastic about the school as their children age, assuming the schools remain open. Ventilla, whose daughter currently attends AltSchool, says they will. “I’m applying for our four-year-old son,” he says, “and my expectation is this will be the school he graduates from — maybe even from high school down the line.”

What if there is no AltSchool high school? With the distinct possibility in mind, we reach out to the head of the private high school who we’d been told was less than enthusiastic about AltSchool. We ask if it’s true that he has concerns about AltSchool graduates. He clarifies his comments, saying that his school “looks at the background of applicants on a student-by-student basis,” but he adds that “some” might have concerns about its curriculum.

“Schools are hard,” adds this person, who asked not to be named. “Trying to develop good schools and good software are different enterprises. It may be hard to do both.”","andreessen horowitz paul france

The best stores for Black Friday deals

Amazon

Amazon has our favorite online deals every Black Friday in the US, and that's just because it sells so many different items, and does so very cheaply in November. And November 2017 looks to be no different. It specializes in video game system bundles, so look for very cheap PS4 Slim and Xbox One S consoles. Sometimes it's a price drop, sometimes it's an extra game or controller packed in, and rarely it's both. We'll keep you updated on our Amazon Black Friday deals page.

Jet already has its Black Friday preview updated, and it's selling everything from the smaller Google Mini speaker with Google Assistant built in, to the new Playskool Tickle Me Elmo doll. Want a brand new 49-inch Samsung TV for under $650. There's a bargain here for you today, and there's way more where that came from, according to the Jet Black Friday early preview page.

Walmart

Walmart sells a little bit of everything, and because of its size, it's willingly to offer deep Black Friday discounts, or what it calls ""rollback prices."" That means you can get deals on everything from a new Apple iPhone to the latest must-have toys for kids in one quick shopping spree. We've highlighted some of this very deals below and on our Walmart Black Friday page.

Toys R Us

We have some good news and some bad news about Toys R Us. First the bad news is that the kid-focused retailer filed for bankruptcy in September. The good news, for you at least, is that it may be willing to offer massive discounts on everything from bikes to LEGOs to attract buyers. You can smell the discounts (and the desperation) over on our Toys R Us Black Friday deals list.

Newegg

Some of the best computer deals can be found at Newegg, where the retailer sells fully built laptops and desktops for cheaper than almost any other US store. It also specializes in components if you're looking to build your own PC. And, of course, it has accessories on sale. Basically, any nerdy gadget you can think of is on our Newegg Black Friday deals page.

Target

If there's one thing Target is known for on Black Friday, it's offering some of the best prices on Apple products, especially the iPad. Right now eBay has the best discount on an iPad Pro, but we're keeping a watchful eye on other tech discounts from this big US retail chain where more often than not, you walk in needing to buy one thing and walk out with a shopping cart full of stuff. Only a few more days to go on our Target Black Friday deals list.

eBay

We keep telling people every Black Friday that eBay is for more than just auctions. It often has the lowest prices on electronics throughout the holiday shopping season. 2017 will be no different, which is why you should pay close attention to our best ebay Black Friday deals page.","amazon lockscreen adsview deal iphone

Brendan Griffiths,Pick up a cheap GoPro with these deals,2017-11-22T17:04:57.325Z,techradar,The best cheap GoPro deals on Black Friday 2017,http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/camcorders/cheap-gopro-deals-1296815,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFaL7URdTMhL6QZbN7ncDn-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Cheap GoPro deals during Black Friday 2017 are rather easy to find if you're fast enough to scoop up one of the best action cameras on sale this holiday season.

These tiny cameras so good that the name GoPro is more popular than the entire action camera category in general. But they don't come cheap - well most of the time at least. We've rounded up all of the best GoPro deals, so that if you do want to buy one, you can make sure you get the best possible price. Our deals are checked every day to make sure all GoPro prices are up to date! We didn't really see any significant discounts on Black Friday, so we'd jump on any discounts you see rather than wait.

If you're just after a regular camera deal, be sure to check out our guide to the best cheap cameras.

What's a good GoPro deal?

Well, that's up to you. We've ordered the GoPros on this page in order of prestige. You can get some seriously discounted GoPro deals if you opt for some of the older models or the relatively new unnumbered GoPro Hero Session, which offers all the best GoPro features but in an easy to use and very affordable model. Naturally, we've updated our cheap GoPro deals page with the brand new Hero 6 Black deals for those of you looking the best GoPro action camera yet.

1. GoPro Hero 6 Black

The best GoPro camera yet?

Captures 4K video at 60fps

Improved image stabilization

Water-resistant without housing

4K recording has never been better in the GoPro range, as the new GoPro Hero 6 Black now records at a super smooth 60 fps (frame per second). Image stabilization is super important given the active lifestyles most GoPros record, so it's great to see this newest model improve even further. Even the 1080p recording has been improved with a boost to 240fps - excellent for maximizing those slow-motion shots!

GoPro Hero6 Black bundle

Now $449 (was $499) $50 off in the US

You can get not only the Hero6 Black for $50 less, but tons of necessary accessories with this sweet deal. Included in the box is an $50 eBay gift card and 16GB MicroSD card.

The best GoPro camera in years

FOV: Super view, Wide, Medium, Narrow | 4K video: up to 30fps | 1080p video: up to 120fps | WVGA video: up to 240fps | Stills: 12MP | Burst: up to 30fps | Wireless: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Auto low light: Yes

Captures 4K video

Touchscreen for easy controls

Water-resistant without housing

The Hero5 Black is the GoPro we always wanted. The new waterproof design out-of-the-box makes it more resilient and the new camera has enough to make it a convincing update. The picture quality is better, it finally has video stabilization and the touchscreen makes it easier to use than any other GoPro. Sale items aside, it's cheaper than most prices for the older GoPro Hero 4 Black now too.

GoPro Hero5 Black bundle

Now S$329 (was $399) $70 off in the US

You can get not only the Hero5 Black, but tons of necessary accessories with this sweet deal through Sam's Club in the US – just $329 – that's cheaper than the rest and with more stuff!

3. GoPro Hero5 Session

The small, but still 4K-capable GoPro

FOV: Super view, Wide, Medium, Narrow | 4K video: up to 30fps | 1080p video: up to 90fps | Stills: 10MP | Burst: up to 30fps | Wireless: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Auto low light: Yes

Small, unobtrusive design

Captures stabilized 4K video

Several new field of view modes

The GoPro Hero5 Session is a capable 4K action camera with a minimalist design that pushes the specs to the max within its cube-shaped confines. The Hero5 Session is also a major specs boost for GoPro's tiniest action camera. It now shoots stabilized 4K video and has a variety of new field of view modes. It's more expensive than its predecessor, but worth the upgrade.

GoPro Hero5 Session

Now $289 (was 355.47) $66.47 off in the US

Walmart has a great discount on a GoPro Hero5 Sessions action camera bundle that includes a casing, head strop, hand grip, 16GB SD card and a variety of other adhesive mounts. If you want a kit to just start recording your adventures, this is the perfect deal.

4. GoPro Hero Session

GoPro, simplified

FOV: Wide, Medium | 1080p video: up to 60fps | Stills: 8MP | Burst: up to 10fps | Wireless: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | Auto low light: Yes

Small, unobtrusive design

Tough and water resistant

Good battery

The model, simply called the GoPro Hero Session, has replaced the very similar GoPro Hero 4 Session. They're the same price and considerably cheaper than the most recent GoPro Hero5 Session. Actually, looking around at the various GoPro models, this looks like the cheapest of the lot seeing as the older GoPro Hero is proving hard to get a hold of nowadays. So if you want an entry level GoPro, this could be the one to go for.

GoPro Hero Session

Now $149 (was $199) $50 off in the US

The GoPro Hero Session is already one of the most affordable action cameras on the market and now its even cheaper with this $50 discount.View Deal

5. GoPro Hero 4 Black deals

The best of the best – the action camera superhero of 2015

30fps 4K video and 120fps at 1080p

Fast and effective Wi-Fi connection

Sturdy mounting system

Compared to the models before it, the GoPro Hero4 Black offers the best image quality, plus a 2x more powerful processor that delivers super slow motion at 240 frames per second. High-resolution 4K30 and 2.7K601 video combines with 1080p120 and 720p240 slow motion to enable immersive footage of you and your world.

With the arrival of the newer Hero5, expect to see prices drop soon. As things stand many retailers are selling it for more than the Hero5! So it may be worth checking out the deals on the newer model (see above) before opting for this one.

GoPro Hero4 Black (Refurbished) is $55 off in the US

Want one of the best GoPros but don't want to pay a fortune? This refurbished GoPro on Amazon is available for a cool $224.99 – that's more than $50 less than GoPro itself has it for. View Deal

Cheaper than the Hero4 Black

1080p video at 60fps

Touchscreen display

UPDATE: This model has now been discontinued in Australia, but retailers could still have some stock available.

The GoPro Hero4 Silver was the first-ever GoPro to feature a built-in touch display. Controlling the camera, framing shots and playing back content is very convenient with this model – just view, tap and swipe the screen.

This GoPro captures 1080p60 and 720p120 video, plus 12MP photos at 30 frames per second. It's not the best anymore, but it often cheaper than the GoPro Hero4 Black model above.

1080p recording

Built-in Wi-Fi enables you to use the GoPro App to control the camera remotely, preview shots and share your favorites on Facebook, Twitter and more.

Compatible with all GoPro mounts, you can wear it or attach it to your gear for immersive POV footage of your favorite activities.

8. GoPro Karma Drone deals

Looking to take to the skies with your GoPro camera? There are certainly cheaper camera drones available, but this is one of the best premium setups out there. You can buy the drone on its own (often listed as 'GoPro Karma Light' or 'GoPro Karma with harness'), or get it bundled with the excellent GoPro Hero5 Black camera.

GoPro Karma Drone with HERO6 Black

Now $999 (was $1,199) $200 off in the US

If you want the most complete package of GoPro's latest devices look no farther. This discounted kit includes the brand's drone with an included handheld gimbal and latest action camera.

We've also included price comparison charts for both below, but you may be able to save a bit of cash by buying the drone and camera separately (check out the GoPro Hero5 Black deals near the top of this page). You'll find the best GoPro Karma prices below though.","gopro hero session gopro simplified fov

Brendan Griffiths,Looking for a Nintendo Switch Black Friday stock update?,2017-11-20T14:01:44.323Z,techradar,The best Nintendo Switch bundles and deals on Black Friday 2017,http://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-deals,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rsHJYyzfe3iMEsqKdmpA4P-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Nintendo Switch bundle deals have stepped up a gear this week and we've seen huge numbers of them selling as retailers gear up to one of the busiest shopping seasons of the year. That's right, Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals are coming, with some retailers even pushing out some great bundles right now. Stock has been an issue since the Nintendo Switch launched, but we're seeing a vast improvement nowadays with a better selection of retailers managing to meet demand. But that could all change the closer we get to Black Friday and Christmas, so we wouldn't wait too long.

We'll list as many Nintendo Switch bundles on this page as we can find from reliable retailers. We've also rounded up the best deals and prices for extra Joy-Con controllers, Pro controllers and even some cheap Nintendo Switch memory cards.

Thanks to our automatically-updating price comparison charts, if a retailer does opt for a discount, you'll see it below. As retailers open up their Nintendo Switch bundles with extra games and controllers, we'll give the best ones a shout in this article too. If you'd rather see bundles than standalone prices, head on over to our US or UK sections.

If you're waiting for more games to arrive first, get your Ninty dose fixed with a cheap 3DS deal. If you're after Nintendo Switch deals in Australia, check out our Australian page.

The latest Nintendo Switch deals:

Want to know where to buy a Nintendo Switch? Check out our comparison chart below for the latest Nintendo Switch prices. In the UK, stocks seems to be much more prevalent now but US stock seems to still be a bit thin on the ground - but gradually improving. It's too early in the year to pay over the asking price if you ask us even if you are after one for Christmas. All is not lost though as we have found some good value Nintendo Switch bundles with games/accessories underneath our comparison chart. Don't forget, if you're buying the console on its own, the RRP is $299/£279, so you don't want to pay more than that unless you're getting some extras.

Note: US stock is a bit hit and miss, but if you're struggling and don't want to wait, there are lots of Nintendo Switch deals on eBay .

Nintendo Switch bundles (USA)

In the US, GameStop is now taking orders for a variety of Nintendo Switch bundles. Options include Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Top be honest, we're just not seeing many other retailers offer bundles right now, not ones that that don't cost more than buying the items individually at least.

We've highlighted our picks of the best Nintendo Switch bundles below. Just be aware that they don't really offer much of a discount over buying the items separately, except for the fact that most stores have sold out of the Switch on its own. We'll steer you clear of bundles that actively charge you more than the regular combined RRP as we saw a lot of big stores do in recent months. We're hoping for some far better options closer to Black Friday though.

Nintendo Switch | Super Mario Odyssey | $359.99 @ GameStop

It turns out Super Mario Odyssey was more than worth the wait and is another fine addition to the growing collection of quality Nintendo Switch exclusives. Savings are at a minimum here, but seeing as this game should amongst your most wanted, this bundle is a great place to start. View Nintendo Switch bundle: Grey Nintendo Switch with Super Mario Odyssey $359.99 @ GameStop View Nintendo Switch bundle: Red/Blue Nintendo Switch with Super Mario Odyssey $359.99 @ GameStop



Nintendo Switch | Carry case | $313.99 @ Walmart

If you're planning on taking advantage of the portable nature of the Nintendo Switch, then we'd seriously advise picking up a carry case to protect it. This red case comes with the Switch for a mere $14 extra and will fit the console with Joy-Con controllers and eight cartridges. You also get a screen protector. This deal is available for both the gray and red/blue version of the console. View Nintendo Switch bundle: Nintendo Switch with carry case $313.99View Deal

Nintendo Switch | Zelda: Breath of the Wild | $359.99 @ GameStop

Despite being out for months now, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is still $60 at most stores, so this Nintendo Switch bundle isn't quite as overpriced as it looks. And let's face it, with stock continuing to sell out, there's not much incentive for stores like GameStop to knock any money off. View Nintendo Switch bundle: Nintendo Switch with Zelda: Breath of the Wild $359.99 @ GameStop

Nintendo Switch | Sonic Forces | $329.99 @ GameStop

This is the cheapest Nintendo Switch bundle we've seen that comes with a game. In all honesty though, Sonic Forces forces is pretty average and the extra $20 is more than worth it for the likes of Zelda or Mario instead. If you're buying a Switch bunlde as a present, this could be one to avoid. Loyal Sonic fans on the other hand... View Nintendo Switch bundle: Grey Nintendo Switch, Sonic Forces $329.99 @ GameStop View Nintendo Switch bundle: Red/Blue Nintendo Switch, Sonic Forces $329.99 @ GameStopView Deal

Nintendo Switch bundles (UK)

As with any new console there will be bundles available containing extra controllers or games. UK gamers are starting to get some decent offers, with actual discounts on some bundles. Compared to the stock shortages the US is facing, it's much more of a buyer's market although we're waiting for the truly special deals in the next few weeks.

Nintendo Switch | Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle | £279.99 @ Amazon

Looking for a cheap Nintendo Switch with at least one game? Then this is one of the best options we've seen. Especially as Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle is still quite new. Also available with the Red/Blue Switch through the link below. View Nintendo Switch deal: Nintendo Switch, Mario + Rabbids £279.99 @ Amazon

Nintendo Switch | Rayman Legends | £289.99 @ Game

As much as we love Rayman, we imagine many gamers have already played it or one of the multiple remasters over the years, so perhaps some of the other Switch deals would be a better match. This is very cheap though. View Nintendo Switch bundle: Nintendo Switch, Rayman Legends £289.99 @ GameView Deal

Mario Edition Nintendo Switch | Super Mario Odyssey £308.99 @ Nintendo

We've seen it go for less, but the offer sold out straight away. If you really want the rare Switch bundle though, this is the best price right now. View Nintendo Switch deal: Mario Edition Nintendo Switch bundle £308.99 @ AmazonView Deal

Nintendo Switch | Mario Kart 8 Deluxe | accessories pack | £329.99 @ Nintendo

Nintendo Switch Q&A

As with any new console announcement we imagine you're wanting to know a bit more about the console before you put any money down. So in addition to finding the best Nintendo Switch deals, we're going to help bring in answers to the burning questions.

What are the Joy-Con controllers?

The Joy-Con controller is actually a pair of controllers that attach to the sides the the Nintendo Switch when not in use or when playing in tablet form away from the TV.

When playing the Nintendo Switch on the TV though, you can remove them and play with one in each hand. The left hand gets a controller with an analogue stick and d-pad, the right hand handles the one with a second analogue and the usual A, B, X and Y face buttons.

What's the Joy-Con Grip controller?

The Joy-Con Grip is an additional accessory that joins the two Joy-Con controllers together, forming something something a bit more solid for you to hold thanks to the extended handles and plastic block between the two sides. The square dimension form-factor may remind older gamers of the Dreamcast controller, while everyone else will mainly be thinking how it resembles an odd-looking dog face. Nintendo is providing one in the box with the Nintendo Switch, so you won't have to buy one separately.

Is there a Nintendo Switch Pro controller?

Yes and it doesn't come with the console. But you won't actually need one to play certain games, so don't feel pressured in to buying one. The Nintendo Switch Pro controller is a more traditional-style pad and launched alongside the Nintendo Switch. Prices aren't cheap though, starting around $69.99/£64.99. There's currently no sign of a Nintendo Switch Premium Edition console with one included, but that could change the closer to the Black Friday shopping season.

Do I need to buy extra controllers for multiplayer on Nintendo Switch?

Possibly not! Remember how the Joy-Con controller splits in two? Turn them sideways and you get two basic controllers, each with their own analogue stick and face buttons - the d-pad acts as face functions on the left controller. So far we've seen 2K's NBA series, Snipper Clips and Mario Kart being used this way for local multiplayer in both docked and tablet modes. So you get multiplayer functionality straight out of the box with no additional purchase required.

However, if you want to play four-player games, then you're going to need to invest in an extra pair of Joy-Con controllers or some Pro controllers. We'd buy the Joy-Cons as a pair (see our comparison chart above) as you'll save a bit of cash over buying them separately. Better yet, if your friends own a Switch, ask them to bring their controllers to the party!

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild deals

The reviews have heaped huge praise upon this eagerly awaited launch title, making it an essential purchase for any Nintendo Switch buyer. As with any new console, the prices of the big games can be more expensive than usual. We've shopped around for you though and have found the best prices for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch. Take a look below.

Nintendo Switch Micro SD memory card deals

With only 32GB of internal storage, you'll be wanting to pick up a cheap memory card or two for your new Nintendo Switch for any digital purchases or the inevitable game-fixing patches. Don't fret though, they're actually surprisingly cheap, with even 64GB ones coming in at under £20/$25.

What memory cards does the Nintendo Switch need? Those will be Micro SD cards also known as, depending on their size, as MicroSDHC (up to 32GB) or MicroSDXC (up to a huge 2TB soon). Nintendo will be releasing their own branded cards, but you'll be paying more, just for a label. So for now, we'd take a look at this range of cheap MicroSDXC Nintendo Switch-friendly cards.","nintendo switch bundle redblue nintendo switch plus

John McCann,The flagship killer returns in style,2017-11-20T14:00:57.323Z,techradar,OnePlus 5T review,http://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-5t-review,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xcRfDaab4XiNxoAjeUn3Gk-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"While there are a few small compromises to consider - no QHD display, stereo speakers, expandable storage or standout camera - the OnePlus 5T represents some of the best value for money in the market. You won’t be disappointed.

The OnePlus 5T, as the name suggests, isn't a completely new handset – rather, it's an incremental upgrade of the OnePlus 5.

It's not just an upgrade though; it's also a replacement, as OnePlus has ceased production and sales of the phone it launched just six months prior to the arrival of the OnePlus 5T.

This isn't a surprising move, as OnePlus did exactly the same thing in 2016 when it introduced the OnePlus 3T half a year after launching the OnePlus 3 .

So what do you get with OnePlus' second generation 'T'? The main talking points include the biggest screen the firm has ever put on a phone, a tweaked design, improved rear camera and face recognition.

In short, there's enough new stuff to justify its existence without it offering a radically new smartphone experience.

Check out our OnePlus 5T hands on video below to see the phone in action

The good news is that the OnePlus 5T price is exactly the same as the OnePlus 5's, which means SIM-free you're looking at £449 ($499, AU$599) for the 6GB/64GB model, and £499 ($559, AU$699) for the 8GB/128GB variant.

This makes the OnePlus 5T cheaper than pretty much all of its flagship rivals – but significantly the difference in spec between them is the smallest it's ever been.

As far as a OnePlus 5T release date goes, the handset will be available from November 21 in North America, UK and Europe, with China, Hong Kong and India getting the phone soon after.

In the UK, OnePlus has signed an exclusive deal with O2, with the network offering the handset on a range of tariffs for those who don’t fancy buying the 5T outright. You can see the best OnePlus 5T deals O2 has to offer by clicking here.

Display

Biggest-ever screen on a OnePlus phone

6.01-inch Full HD, AMOLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio

The 6-inch full HD display on the 5T is bright and clear

The single biggest change on the OnePus 5T is the display, with the handset boasting a 6.01-inch Full HD AMOLED panel with a 18:9 aspect ratio that follows this year's trend of elongated screens on the iPhone X , Google Pixel 2 XL , Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG V30 .

It's the first time OnePlus has increased the size of the display on its core handset (the smaller OnePlus X aside), making this the biggest screen we've ever seen on a handset from the Chinese firm.

While its size and aspect ratio may see the OnePlus 5T pull inline with the flagship handsets it's looking to topple, there is still one spec which denies it full membership of the high-end display club: resolution.

OnePlus has once again opted to stick with a Full HD resolution, at 1080 x 2160 with a 401ppi pixel density, while rivals all boast QHD (2K) displays.

It doesn't mean the screen on the OnePlus 5T is poor, and thanks to the AMOLED panel colors are bright and punchy, but when you slide it alongside the competition you can see it's not as sharp. In isolation though, it’s difficult to pick any real fault with it.

OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei also revealed on Twitter that he fooled a fan into thinking it did have a QHD display, when actually it’s stuck with Full HD.

Alongside QHD rivals it doesn't look as good, but it's by no means a bad display

The default color balance does seem to be a little blue, and if that doesn't suit your eyes you can change this in the settings menu.

The screen calibration options enable you to switch to SRBG, DCI-P3, adaptive mode or customize your own settings, although the default mode does give you the punchier colors.

Selecting another mode mutes the vibrancy, but does give a more natural look to colors, especially when viewing images. The choice is yours, but we opted to stick with the default setting for the majority of our OnePlus 5T review.

OnePlus has also included a feature it calls Sunlight Display, which automatically detects harsh light and adapts the display for the best viewability; it's basically an auto brightness mode, but it also knows what you’re doing on screen (whether it's a game, movie or general navigation) and will optimize the display accordingly.

We didn't notice the OnePlus 5T adapting the screen during our review period, but we also didn't experience any viewability issues, which suggests that Sunlight Display does work, if only subtly.

Design

Premium metal unibody looks and feels great

Fingerprint scanner on rear with smaller bezels up front

The bigger display has had a knock-on effect in terms of the design of the OnePlus 5T, with the bezels above and below the screen getting slimmed down to provide a sleeker look and an 80.5% screen-to-body ratio.

That reduction in bezel has necessitated another design change too, with the fingerprint scanner and physical navigation keys disappearing from the front of the phone.

Biometric fans needn't worry though, as the digit reader has been relocated to the rear of the device, and its centralized position means it's easy to hit with your forefinger – and of course there's now face recognition too, of which more in a moment.

The OnePlus 5T continues with the premium metal unibody design of the phone it's replacing, which makes it look good and feel great in the hand, with the gently-curving rear helping it nestle nicely into the palm.

At 156.1 x 75 x 7.3mm and 162g the OnePlus 5T is wider, taller and heavier than the OnePlus 5, but remains the same thickness, making it similar in size and weight to the LG V30 and iPhone 8 Plus .

Something the design doesn't offer, though, is much grip, so you may want to invest in a material or silicone case to give you a little extra purchase – although it will add to the phone's size in your hand.

You'll find that the power/lock key on the right, and the volume rocker on the left, fall easily under thumb and finger when you're holding the phone in portrait, and OnePlus continues with its notification slider on the side of the handset, allowing you to easily switch between silent, do not disturb and loud modes.

Another plus point on the OnePlus 5T is that the headphone jack has also been retained, allowing you to plug in your headphones without the need for a clunky adapter.

The camera bump from the OnePlus 5 remains on the 5T, but this time around the edges of the protrusion have been more lovingly sculpted into the main body of the device for a more uniform and slick look.

OnePlus claims it has added an anti-fingerprint layer to the finish on the OnePlus 5T, but we found that it still got grubby pretty easily, although marks and prints are easy enough to wipe off.

At launch the OnePlus 5T is available in just one color, Midnight Black, with no word on whether more hues will be on offer in the future.

Face recognition

Fast, easy and effective

Not as accomplished as iPhone X

Another key feature, and a first for OnePlus, is the inclusion of face recognition tech as the brand attempts to ride the coattails of the iPhone X.

Face recognition on the OnePlus 5T isn't as advanced as Apple’s offering, but it's still surprisingly good, using over 100 facial identifiers to check it's you.

It's used only for unlocking the handset, and you'll need to double-tap the screen or press the power key to utilize it.

The good news is that it's really easy to setup, with the phone requiring only a matter of seconds to lock in your look.

Face unlock is surprisingly quick and easy to setup on the OnePlus 5T

It's incredibly fast, with almost no delay between you tapping the screen or button and your home screen appearing before you. OnePlus claims the tech can identify you and unlock the handset in just 0.4 seconds, and we’re inclined to agree.

This does mean it’s a touch slower than the fingerprint scanner (0.2 seconds), and it requires you to be looking almost directly at the phone for it to work.

However, we did find that face unlock worked at some impressive angles, which means you don't have to hold the OnePlus 5T directly in front of your face for it to work.

Something it can't do, but which the iPhone X can, is see you in the dark. That's because, unlike Apple, OnePlus hasn't used an infrared camera to spy you in the dark.

Face unlock on the 5T requires a light source – street lights at night are enough, but the screen brightness itself isn't – to check your face.

The OnePlus 5T can handle glasses and no glasses, so whether or not you’re wearing them the phone will know it’s still you, as long as your eyes are still visible. Where it struggles is when the eyes are covered.

The OnePlus 5T unlocked for us in the top row, but the disguises worn in the bottom row saw the 5T lock us out.

We tired face unlock in several different scenarios (as you can see above), but when we wore a low slung hat, and then blinkered goggles, the 5T wouldn’t unlock.

We also passed it around the office, friends and family to see if anyone else’s face unlocked the handset, and the good news is they didn’t. The likelihood is that the technology may be fooled on rare occasions – as it has been on the iPhone X – but it feels secure.

In the future OnePlus plans to expand the use of face recognition to enable you to log in to apps and verify purchases, but for now it's using the OnePlus 5T as a test bed for the technology to make sure it's secure.","samsung galaxy s8

Jon Mundy,Amazon’s cheap tablet still makes us fairly cheerful,2017-11-21T13:30:15.324Z,techradar,Amazon Fire 7 (2017) review,http://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-fire-7-2017,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wL8Y4qMyauvMuEgHX27pNj-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Amazon is still in a $50/£50 tablet league of its own with the Fire 7 (2017), but the low-res display is now arguably a cut too far for a modern media-focused device.

We’ve built up some pretty straightforward expectations for a new Amazon Fire 7 tablet. Each iteration is going to be a solid but basic mini tablet that acts as a 7-inch window onto the sprawling Amazon ecosystem.

But what we expect above all else is that a new Amazon Fire 7 is going to be extremely cheap. The new Amazon Fire 7 (2017) meets all of the above criteria, and it still starts at a low price.

With these essential points ticked off, then, two questions arise: Is cheap and cheerful still enough in 2017? And also, what’s new?

You'll usually find the Fire 7 priced at $49.99/£49.99 (around AU$85, though there's still no word on an Australian release) but the price fluctuates throughout the year.

For example, Black Friday 2017 will see the price drop down to £29.99 and it's expected to be a similar situation for those in the US. That's the cheapest we've ever seen the tablet, which is easy to buy now directly from Amazon in the UK and US.

The most helpful Fire 7 yet

Alexa personal assistant comes to Fire

Dual-band Wi-Fi improves web browsing considerably

Undoubtedly the headline addition with the latest Amazon Fire 7 is Amazon’s Alexa personal assistant. US users will have seen this already in previous Fire devices, but it’ll be a first for UK customers – though older models are also getting it as a software update.

Alexa is as impressively useful a tool here as it is on any other Amazon device, such as the Echo speaker or one of the more capable (and expensive) Fire tablets. From the very start, it coped with our casual requests like “play me some music” or “what’s the latest news?” without missing a beat.

In the former case, Alexa responded with an Amazon Music radio station it thought we might like based on our previous activity. In the latter case, we were given a Flash Briefing, which amounted to the latest BBC News headlines delivered in a radio report format.

Asking “How tall is Wayne Rooney?” while that news report was playing brought up an image of the stout footballer, as well as text and a vocal response that answered the question directly. Impressively, once Alexa had finished talking, the Flash Briefing resumed in the background.

Our Alexa experience wasn’t perfect, though. When we asked Amazon’s assistant to “Open Guns of Boom,” it thought we were asking it to “Open Guns of Boob”. We’re sure the web results for that would have been rather interesting had we flicked over from the default Amazon tab.

Alexa didn’t like it when we asked it to “Open Geekbench” either, though it was on the ball when we asked to “Open Real Racing 3”.

Activating Alexa is a simple case of pressing and holding the virtual home button at the bottom of the screen, which brings up a subtle blue bar to let you know it’s listening. It doesn’t immediately take over the display like, say, Siri.

If Amazon is going to place Alexa at the heart of its hardware range - which seems quite likely - then it might be an idea to incorporate a dedicated hardware button in future iterations. It’s also a shame that the Fire isn’t listening out for an audible trigger command, like on the Echo. But the current solution works just fine.

Indeed, alongside the similarly priced Echo Dot, the new Amazon Fire 7 is the most affordable way to get hold of Amazon’s advanced personal assistant.

Those with smart home set-ups will also be able to use Alexa on the Amazon Fire 7 (2017) to interact with their gear.

Another notable addition to the Fire 7 - although much less interesting - is dual-band Wi-Fi. This enables the tablet to connect to both the 2.4Ghz and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands, which increases your connectivity options. Indeed, with 5GHz now supported, internet browsing speeds can be much quicker than with the 2015 model.

Design and display

Essentially the same design as the 2015 model

1024 x 600 really isn’t sharp enough even at this price

You might struggle to tell the difference between the Amazon Fire 7 (2017) and its two-year-old predecessor. They look very similar indeed, with the same functional matt plastic body (available in black, blue, red or yellow), embossed Amazon logo, and chunky screen bezels.

However, while the new Fire 7 occupies a familiar footprint, it’s actually 1mm thinner, 8 grams lighter, and 1mm longer than the Amazon Fire 7 (2015).

The keen-eyed among you may also have noticed that there’s been a slight reshuffle of the buttons and ports. It’s nothing drastic, but the volume keys and the 3.5mm headphone port have switched places along the top edge.

In practice, this means that all of the tablet’s physical controls are positioned near the corners, making them a little easier to reach without looking.

That’s an improvement in our book, although the placement still feels somewhat awkward when using the tablet in portrait mode, as does the decision to pile everything (the micro USB port is also here) onto one short edge.

Well, we say everything. The microSD slot is positioned on the right-hand edge of the device.

Amazon claims to have improved the display of the Amazon Fire 7 (2017) over its 2015 predecessor, with better contrast levels. That may well be true, but two core facts remain: it’s not very bright and it’s not very sharp.

If you had any aspirations of taking your new Fire 7 out into the sunshine this summer, you’ll be sorely disappointed. Doing so will render the screen a washed-out, overly reflective mess.

It’s fine when you bring it indoors, but doing so will serve to bring home how fuzzy the picture is. Perhaps we’re being overly harsh given that low low price point, but we’d suggest that 1024 x 600 falls short for any mainstream tablet in 2017.

Keep in mind that even a bog-standard budget smartphone will hit at least 1280 x 720 these days - and such phones invariably feature displays that are much smaller than the 7-inch example here.

Perhaps this really is all you can get for $50/£50 right now. But given the screen is the key component in any tablet, we’d argue that either raising the price by 10 to 20 dollars/pounds or dropping the cameras altogether would be preferable in order to hit that 720p minimum standard.","the

Lydia Wheeler,"The privacy of emails, photos stored in the cloud, even heart rate history from a smartwatch could be at stake, civil libertarians say, as the Supreme Court takes up a potential blockbuster case.",2017-11-23T22:06:37Z,the-hill,Justices to weigh cell phone privacy in landmark case,http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/361594-justices-to-weigh-cell-phone-privacy-in-landmark-case,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/privacy_cellphone_112217thinkstock.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The privacy of emails, photos stored in the cloud, even heart rate history from a smartwatch could be at stake, according to civil libertarians, as the Supreme Court takes up a potential blockbuster case after Thanksgiving.

When they return to the bench after the holiday, the justices will weigh whether the history of cell phone locations stored by a phone service provider is searchable without a warrant.

The case, Carpenter v. U.S., centers on Timothy Carpenter, who argues the government violated his Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure when it obtained his cell phone location records from MetroPCS and Sprint without a warrant. Authorities then used that data as trial evidence to convict him of a string of robberies at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan and Ohio from December 2010 to March 2011.

ADVERTISEMENT

The government argues that it was well within its rights under the Stored Communications Act (SCA) of 1986 to get a court order for the records. The law allows this type of data to be searched if the government can show reasonable grounds to believe it will be relevant to a criminal investigation.

To obtain a warrant, law enforcement officers, however, must show there is probable cause.

But beyond the law, the government is arguing that Carpenter lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy because he voluntarily turned his location information over to a third party when he signed up for cell service. It’s a legal theory known as the third-party doctrine.

“Petitioner lacks any subjective expectation of privacy in phone-company records of historical cell-site data because they are business records that MetroPCS and Sprint create for their own purposes,” Acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco, Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco and DOJ Attorney Jenny Ellickson argued in a court brief.

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) staff attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who's representing Carpenter, called the implications of that argument “stunning.”

“If the government’s position wins, it would imperil the search queries people enter into Google or WebMD, our complete browsing histories showing everything we read online, the heart rate data from a smartwatch saved by Apple, a person’s whole life in photos uploaded to the cloud and so much more,” he said.

“In the 21st century we really can’t go about our daily lives without creating these pervasive, highly sensitive digital records held by companies we interact with.”

The ACLU also argues the government is relying on an outdated law.

Though it was updated in part in 1994, Wessler said the SCA really hasn’t been touched since 1986. At that time there were only 1,000 cell sites in the U.S. and less than half of one percent of Americans had a cell phone. Today, he said more than 300,000 cell sites exist and 95 percent of Americans have cell phones.

But the government argues that cell phone location information isn’t personal.

“As explained, the historical cell-site records obtained in this case revealed only that petitioner (or someone using his phone) was in ‘a 3.5 million square-foot to 100 million square-foot area’ when placing or receiving a call,” the DOJ attorneys argued in their brief.

“The records did not (and could not) reveal any information stored on petitioner’s phone or permit law-enforcement officers to learn the sort of detailed personal facts.”

In a friend of the court brief filed in support of the government, the National District Attorneys Association warned the court against eviscerating the third party doctrine.

“To do so would preclude SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] and IRS [Internal Revenue Service] summonses for financial information necessary for their functioning and would bring a halt to countless state prosecutions dependent upon review of third-party records, including public corruption, identity theft, insurance fraud and stalking,” the group wrote.

In Carpenter’s case, the government was given 127 days worth of his location data from MetroPCS and seven days worth from Sprint in early March when Carpenter’s phone was connecting to a Sprint cellular tower in Ohio as part of a roaming agreement between the two companies.

Police obtained 12,898 location points – one for the start and end of each call he made. But since the start of this case, Wessler said data usage has ballooned, forcing service carriers to erect more cell towers that are closer together, which makes data locations more precise.

And since 2010 and 2011 when Carpenter's data was collected, he said providers have started saving location information for text messages and data connections in addition to calls, even when a phone is sitting in a bag or pocket and checking for emails or weather updates.

Wessler said the ACLU acknowledges that police should be able to obtain some of this information within limits.

“Our position is that people have a reasonable expectation that police won’t be able to create a map of longer term locations,” he said. “That’s a power police have never had to be able to assemble days, weeks months worth of where people have gone.”

Where the line should be drawn between short-term data that’s accessible without a warrant and long-term that requires one, Wessler said is for the courts to decide.

Wessler said if justices need a cutoff point between short-term and long-term data, he suggests a 24-hour period.

Oral arguments in the case will be held on Wednesday.","national district attorneys association

Nathaniel Weixel,"The number of people signing up for ObamaCare has surged in the first few weeks of open enrollment this year, contrary to dire predictions.",2017-11-23T17:05:26Z,the-hill,Surge in ObamaCare signups surprises experts,http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/361623-surge-in-obamacare-signups-surprises-experts,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/obamacaresignup_112217getty.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The number of people signing up for ObamaCare has surged in the first few weeks of open enrollment this year, contrary to dire predictions.

The spike in sign-ups is good news for supporters of the health-care law, but experts warn the early numbers don’t necessarily signify a trend. Final enrollment numbers could still be much lower than in the past, they say.

The first ObamaCare open enrollment period of the Trump administration has been surprisingly robust, despite the uncertainty caused by nearly 10 months of repeal attempts in Congress, rising premiums and insurer exits.

ADVERTISEMENT

Through the first 18 days, nearly 2.3 million people have signed up for insurance coverage through ObamaCare exchanges, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a number that has outpaced the same period under former President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaReport: FCC chair to push for complete repeal of net neutrality Right way and wrong way Keystone XL pipeline clears major hurdle despite recent leak MORE.

Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said enrollment is up significantly on a daily basis, but cautioned against drawing conclusions from the early numbers.

“But there are a lot fewer days” in the open enrollment period, he said. “It’s really hard to generalize from these early enrollment numbers.”

There are a number of factors that could weigh down enrollment this year.

Standard & Poor’s earlier this month forecast that enrollment could actually drop by as much as 1.6 million people below last year’s level of 12.2 million signups, in part due to uncertainty from the administration's actions.

This year, open enrollment was cut in half and ends Dec. 15. Even if sign-ups stayed on pace, they would fall well short of previous years because of the shortened time period.

According to Levitt, much of the success of open enrollment also depends on how large the surge in sign-ups is as the deadline approaches.

Levitt said that in past years there were two surges: one around Dec. 15, when consumers could buy coverage effective Jan. 1; and one around Jan. 31, at the very end of open enrollment.

The deadline surge this year would need to be “quite large” in order to maintain steady enrollment from previous years, he added.

Many of the administration's actions may also be spiking early enrollment, according to some health experts.

President Trump has claimed ObamaCare is “imploding” and with Republican lawmakers failing to pass a repeal bill, the administration has taken a hatchet to the law.

Trump signed an executive order that instructed agencies to loosen ObamaCare rules. He has also slashed advertising and outreach dollars by 90 percent.

The administration slashed funds by 41 percent for outside groups that help reach and enroll likely ObamaCare consumers. Last month, it cut off key subsidy payments to insurers used to bring down deductibles for low-income people.

Administration officials have pushed back on the idea that the cuts are part of an effort to sabotage the law, and on multiple occasions noted that ObamaCare enrollment was in decline before Trump took office.

It’s possible those actions have helped boost enrollment, at least in the short term.

“There could be a fear factor, people going out and enrolling before more changes happen,” said Katherine Hempstead, who directs coverage programs at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

“The negative publicity has increased awareness a bit.”

Another reason experts are cautious of the numbers is because consumers may not be aware that many plans are cheaper than in the past.

Trump’s decision to cut off the insurance subsidies has created a situation where some consumers can get much cheaper plans than in the past. In almost every county, according to a recent study by Avalere Health, some consumers can even get a free plan.

Insurers have significantly raised their premiums as a result of losing the payments, but people who are eligible for tax subsidies under the law will largely be shielded from the spike.

“These free insurance plans for many low income people would be a huge selling point, if there were resources for outreach,” Levitt said. “Which there aren’t.”

The initial surge has also put the administration, which has long claimed the health law is failing, in a difficult spot.

The administration is issuing weekly updates about the number of people who enrolled in coverage using healthcare.gov.

But Trump officials are refusing to share what their enrollment targets are, a break in practice from the Obama administration.

If the final enrollment numbers are significantly lower than in the past, it could feed into the GOP narrative that ObamaCare is failing, and bolster new congressional repeal efforts.

There are high stakes for both sides in the ObamaCare fight.

Peter Lee, executive director of California’s insurance exchange Covered California, though, said raw numbers won’t tell the whole story.

“The issue isn’t how the administration talks about numbers, it’s how the administration promotes enrollment,” he said.

“I don’t care much about enrollment reporting. I care about enrollment promotion efforts.”","robert wood johnson foundation

Terminating the information-sharing agreement is not in itself a sign that Flynn is working with Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. But, according to the Times, it signals that Flynn is at least discussing the option with prosecutors.

ADVERTISEMENT

Flynn’s lawyers notified Trump’s legal team of the decision in the past few days, according to four people involved in the case who spoke to the newspaper. The report was later confirmed by the Washington Post.

Lawyers for both Trump and Flynn declined to comment to the Times.

A deal with Flynn would give prosecutors insight into how Trump’s team conducted itself during the campaign and the early days of the administration, the Times reported.

The report comes after NBC News on Wednesday reported that Mueller is looking to question Bijan Kian, an associate of Flynn. Previous reports have suggested that the special counsel already has enough evidence to indict Flynn and his son, who also worked for Trump’s campaign.

Trump’s legal team has insisted recently that Mueller’s probe will end in the coming months, though legal experts have said the investigation is likely to drag on.

In October, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Richard Gates were indicted on charges including money laundering and conspiracy against the United States.

Manafort and Gates both pleaded not guilty to the charges.","national security adviser

Franken did not address in his new statement whether or not he planned to stay in office. A spokesperson for the senator told the Star Tribune on Thursday that Franken had no intentions to step down.

Franken also suggested on Thursday that some of his conduct with women might have been misjudged.

""I'm a warm person; I hug people. I've learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters, I crossed a line for some women -- and I know that any number is too many.""

The statement came a day after HuffPost reported that two women had accused him of groping them in 2008.

“It’s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I don’t remember those campaign events,"" Franken said in a statement to HuffPost regarding the allegations.

Last week, radio host Leeann Tweeden released a photo from 2006 of Franken grabbing at her breasts while she was sleeping. Tweeden also accused him of forcibly kissing her during a rehearsal for a USO show.

Her allegations sparked a call from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellAlabama election has GOP racing against the clock McConnell PAC demands Moore return its money Klobuchar taking over Franken's sexual assault bill MORE (R-Ky.) for an Ethics Committee investigation into Franken.

Earlier this week, CNN reported that an additional woman had accused Franken of inappropriate behavior in 2010.

A recent poll found that only 22 percent of the people in Minnesota believe Franken should stay in office.

“ObamaCare premiums are going up, up, up, just as I have been predicting for two years. ObamaCare is OWNED by the Democrats, and it is a disaster,” Trump tweeted.

“But do not worry. Even though the Dems want to Obstruct, we will Repeal & Replace right after Tax Cuts!”

ObamaCare premiums have risen after Trump ended key subsidies to insurers that helped to cover costs for low-income Americans.

Trump’s promise to repeal ObamaCare comes as enrollment in the health-care law has unexpectedly surged since the start of the open enrollment period.

Nearly 2.3 million people signed up for coverage through ObamaCare exchanges during the first 18 days of the open enrollment period — outpacing the rate of enrollment that took place during the same time period under former President Obama.

Trump has repeatedly pushed for the GOP to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But the Republican attempt to repeal the law fell short earlier this year.

Republicans are now considering repealing the ObamaCare individual mandate in tax reform.","trump realdonaldtrump

“Our country is doing very well. Our stock market has hit a new all-time high. Unemployment has hit a 17 year low. We’ve created $5.5 trillion worth of values. We are doing something very special – people are feeling it,” Trump said toward the end of his address.

“The enthusiasm in this country has never been higher. We’re very, very happy on this Thanksgiving Day,” he added.

Trump’s roughly four-minute video address followed a tweet earlier Thursday in which he touted his administration’s accomplishments and vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

During the video, Trump recounted the tale of the pilgrims traveling to North America on the Mayflower, saying they had few resources, but were “rich in faith, courage and dreams.”

He also recalled the first Thanksgiving in which pilgrims and Native Americans joined together “to rejoice and praise God.”

“Today we give thanks for all of the pilgrims, pioneers and patriots who have gone before us, and for all those warriors who have kept us safe and free,” Trump said. “This week, we know that thousands of men and women in uniform won’t be able to come home for Thanksgiving. We’re eternally grateful for their courage, heroism and sacrifice.”

He also praised Americans who volunteer and give a helping hand to the sick, hungry and others who are in need of assistance. He specifically mentioned those who assisted in the face of natural disasters and mass shootings.

“This year, in the face of painful hardships, we have seen the incredible strength of the American spirit,” Trump said.

Conyers reportedly settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 with a former staffer who alleged she was fired because she didn't succumb to his sexual advances. Former staffers also alleged that Conyers made unwanted sexual advances toward his female aides.

Conyers has admitted he took part in a settlement with a former female employee who accused him of sexual misconduct in order to avoid litigation in 2015, but denied the allegations. He said he settled the matter to avoid litigation.

A former scheduler for Conyers also alleged he rubbed her shoulders, kissed her forehead and attempted to hold her hand.

The House Ethics Committee announced Tuesday it has begun an investigation into the allegations against Conyers.

“If men who engage in this behavior suffered real repercussions, more victims would speak up – and maybe other men would decide to act like decent, civilized adults and not prey on women who work for and trust and admire them,” Rice said.

Avery Anapol,Thanksgiving Day will mark the 100th day President Trump has spent at one of his properties since taking office.,2017-11-23T13:06:34Z,the-hill,Thanksgiving is Trump’s 100th day at a Trump property as president,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/361648-thanksgiving-is-trumps-100th-day-at-a-trump-property,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/trumpmaralago.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Thanksgiving Day will mark the 100th day President Trump has spent at one of his properties since taking office.

The Trump family is spending Thanksgiving weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Thursday is the 28th day he is spending at that property in particular, according to the New York Times’ tracker.

The president has spent most of his property visits–39 days–at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey, according to the tracker. Mar-a-Lago is his second-most visited property, and he has held several official events and meetings there.

Trump has frequently referred to it as the “Winter White House” on Twitter.

Trump’s frequent visits to his properties have been viewed harshly by critics and ethics experts, who say that it gives his organization free publicity, although the president himself no longer manages the company.

Early on in his presidential campaign, Trump said that if elected, he would “rarely leave the White House because there’s so much work to be done.”

“I would not be a president who took vacations,” he said. “I would not be a president that takes time off.”","trump realdonaldtrump

Harper Neidig,AT&T and its supporters have suggested Trump's feud with CNN has played into the case.,2017-11-22T18:17:16Z,the-hill,Trump looms large in AT&T antitrust battle,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/technology/361565-trump-looms-large-in-att-antitrust-battle,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_112117getty.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"President Trump’s feud with CNN is casting a shadow over the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block AT&T from merging with Time Warner, the news outlet’s parent company.

The Justice Department’s decision to bring a lawsuit against a vertical merger — a deal involving two companies that aren’t direct competitors — is a major shift in antitrust policy from previous administrations.

To those who have been raising the alarm about corporate consolidation, the move is long overdue, and a sign that regulators in the Trump administration won't be a rubber stamp for such major deals.

But AT&T and its supporters are suggesting the policy shift is being driven by something other than antitrust law — namely, Trump’s long-running feud with CNN, a network owned by Time Warner.

""Frankly, I don’t know"" if the White House interfered in the merger review, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said in a press conference on Monday. ""But nobody should be surprised that the question keeps coming up.""

Legal experts have suggested AT&T could use the discovery process in the antitrust lawsuit to seek evidence of political motivations in the merger decision. But others are skeptical that tactic would work.

Jonathan Rubin, an antitrust attorney and partner at the law firm MoginRubin, said AT&T would have to answer regulators’ claims that the merger will hurt competitors and consumers. Making the case that Trump interfered in the decision may not sway a judge, he said.

“As a matter of public relations, as a nonlegal matter, that sort of thing might have some usefulness for AT&T,” Rubin said. “As a strategy, as a specific defense in the courtroom, I think it would be futile.”

For its part, AT&T has said that any evidence of improper conduct by the administration won't bode well for the government if it emerges during trial. But the company has emphasized that it believes it has a strong case in favor of the merger, arguing that there is no recent precedent for a vertical deal being blocked in court.

Trump vowed to block the deal in an October 2016 campaign speech, saying such mergers “destroy democracy.""

""As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" Trump said in the Gettysburg, Pa., speech.

Trump reiterated his opposition to the merger Wednesday before leaving Washington to spend Thanksgiving at his Mar-a-Lago club.

""Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country,” he said.

Since coming into office, Trump has repeatedly attacked CNN over its coverage of him.

In July, The New York Times reported that the White House was discussing how to use the AT&T merger as leverage over the news outlet. And earlier this month, it was reported that the Justice Department had demanded that AT&T sell Turner Broadcasting — CNN’s parent company — from Time Warner in order to get the merger approved, though Stephenson denied those reports.

The Justice Department and the White House have both denied any improper interference in the merger review process.

But some opponents of the merger see the political interference narrative as a distraction from what they see as a legitimate case against the $85 billion tie-up.

Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups have argued that together AT&T and Time Warner would be able to jack up prices for networks like HBO, TNT and TBS — all Time Warner subsidiaries. Critics also contend that AT&T’s control of Time Warner’s programming would have anticompetitive effects on rival content distributors and creators.

“Where I am concerned is that AT&T is obviously trying to make this about the politics rather than about the law,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president at Public Knowledge. “The fact is, there were a lot of people who objected to this merger when it came out, before Trump started tweeting about CNN.”

AT&T argues that it has no incentive to withhold programming from rivals, saying it would benefit more from ensuring that its content would be as widely available as possible.

In a speech to the American Bar Association last week, Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official in the Justice Department, criticized the previous administration’s decision to approve a similar merger in Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal under certain “behavioral” conditions. He said that regulators shouldn’t approve such mergers unless companies agree to sell off certain assets that could pose harm to competition.

Sen. Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchProminent conservative passes on Utah Senate bid Republicans offer this impossible choice: Tax cuts or senior care Senate GOP running out of options to stop Moore MORE (R-Utah), while not taking a position on the merger, said he was proud of Delrahim for pursuing the lawsuit against the AT&T-Time Warner deal.

“Throughout an unnecessarily protracted confirmation debate, there were voices suggesting he wasn’t disinterested enough, independent enough, or open-minded enough, to make the tough calls that the Antitrust Division requires. Today, those in doubt learned otherwise,” Hatch said in a statement.

AT&T could try in the legal proceedings to force the Justice Department and the White House to divulge communications about the merger in the hopes that it will find a clear sign of political interference. The company could even try to depose Trump.

But the administration could claim that any such communications are irrelevant or privileged, ultimately leaving it up to the judge to decide what is permissible.

Opponents of the deal argue that the court case will be decided on whether the Justice Department can prove its case on the merits.

Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a telecom lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center, said Trump’s feelings about the deal should have little effect on the outcome of the case.

“The critical issue here is whether this combination causes economic harm,” he said. “Even if it turns out the Trump administration wanted to bring the case, that should not in my mind preclude the requisite finding that this violates antitrust law.”","georgetown university law center

Alexander Bolton,Senate Republicans are at odds with President Trump over Roy Moore and the Alabama Senate race.,2017-11-23T01:47:55Z,the-hill,"Trump, Senate GOP at odds over Roy Moore",http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/361633-trump-senate-gop-at-odds-over-roy-moore,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_mcconnellmitch_101717gncf_lead.jpg,politics,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Senate Republicans are at odds with President Trump over Roy Moore and the Alabama Senate race.

Trump broke more than a week of silence on Tuesday by raising doubt about the allegations of sexual misconduct facing Moore, contradicting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellAlabama election has GOP racing against the clock McConnell PAC demands Moore return its money Klobuchar taking over Franken's sexual assault bill MORE (R-Ky.) and other Senate Republicans.

Trump pushed back on a reporter who asked how he felt about electing a “child molester” by noting that Moore “totally denies it.”

The Alabama Republican became embroiled in scandal after The Washington Post reported that he initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32.

Several other women have come forward to accuse Moore of inappropriate sexual advances that happened when they were teenagers.

“He says it didn’t happen, ”Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. “You have to listen to him, also.”

That’s not what McConnell wanted to hear, according to sources close to the Senate GOP leadership.

McConnell is worried that Moore will drag down Republican candidates in 2018, which is shaping up to be a tough year for the GOP, and will hurt the party’s brand.

“Not only does Moore really hurt Republicans in the Senate and Republicans nationally, he also does great damage to the conservative movement because now every conservative has to answer for Roy Moore,” said a strategist close to the Senate Republican leadership.

“Roy Moore comes along, claiming to be a conservative, and now all conservatives are saddled with a guy who is known for one thing and that’s assaulting kids,” the source added.

McConnell’s top priority is keeping Republicans in control of the Senate after 2018 and some GOP strategists believe that will be tougher with Moore in the Senate.

McConnell told reporters last month that he keeps in mind the lesson of former Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.), who became an embarrassment to the party in 2012 by talking about “legitimate rape.”

Akin not only lost a Missouri Senate seat that the GOP appeared poised to win but he hurt Republican candidates in other states.

“You don’t have to be the most astute to read the exit polls out of New Jersey and Virginia and look at the results around the country to realize women, people of color and voters younger than 40 are moving in a tidal wave against the Republicans. So why would you want, going into 2018, to embrace or be handcuffed to Roy Moore? Why?” said Republican strategist John Weaver.

“At least McConnell and them are smart enough to get that,” he said.

But Trump appears less concerned with how the Alabama race may affect contests next year in Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and other battleground states, and more focused on getting his legislative agenda passed over the next 13 months.

""I can tell you one thing for sure, we don't need a liberal person in there, a Democrat, Jones,"" Trump said this week. ""I've looked at his record— it's terrible on crime. It's terrible at the borders.”

Trump’s senior advisor, Kellyanne Conway, when asked about Moore on Monday, said: “we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.”

State officials say the race won’t likely be certified until Dec. 26, giving Senate Republicans a chance to pass tax reform legislation and a negotiated compromise with the House before Moore or his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, takes the oath of office.

But there are other priorities for which Trump will need as many Republican votes in the Senate as possible: immigration reform, an infrastructure package, deregulation of the financial services industry, to name a few.

“I think Mitch McConnell would love to figure out a way to kick him off the ballot and the White House is resigned to him not getting off the ballot,” said Jim McLaughlin, a Republican consultant who has done a lot of political work in Alabama.

“Mitch McConnell is saying let’s try to get this guy off the ballot. Down in Alabama, the only politician to come out against him is [Sen.] Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbyAlabama's senior senator will 'probably' write in candidate rather than vote for Moore Republican senators wrestle with their Roy Moore problem NIST research: Timing is everything MORE [R-Ala.]. All the other local politicians say let the people decide,” he added.

A second GOP strategist close to Senate GOP leaders, who requested anonymity to speak about the president candidly, said it made sense for Trump not to side with Moore’s accusers because he is facing allegations of inappropriate behavior from at least 13 women.

One accuser, Summer Zervos, who appeared on Trump’s reality television show, “The Apprentice,” has filed a lawsuit that may come before the New York Supreme Court.

Trump’s comments put pressure on the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which both cut fundraising ties with Moore, to spend some money to help him win the race.

Spokespeople with both committees did not respond to requests for comment about Trump’s statement.

Republicans in Alabama say Trump’s response to the allegations against Moore more closely reflects the sentiments of Alabama voters.

A Raycom News Network poll of 3,000 likely Alabama voters this week found that Moore has a two-point lead over Jones and 48 percent of Republicans do not believe the allegations against Moore.

Some Alabama voters still remember Republican candidate Steve Windom’s race for lieutenant governor in 1998 when he was accused by a former prostitute of rape and sodomy. The accuser, Melissa Myers Bush, later admitted in court that she accepted money to make false allegations.

Windom won the race despite the false charges, becoming the first Republican lieutenant governor of the state in more than a century.

“Donald Trump Donald John TrumpO’Malley tells Dems not to fear Trump Right way and wrong way Five things to know about the elephant trophies controversy MORE and the GOP establishment haven’t been on the same page,” said Jon Gray, a GOP consultant based in Alabama who has polled the Senate race frequently.

Gray says that even though Trump is from New York and has spent a lot of time in Florida, “he really does think like Alabamians think.”

“He gets it,” he added.

While McConnell and other Senate Republicans have been quick to side with the women accusing Moore of misconduct, many Alabama voters are giving him the benefit of the doubt.

The Raycom poll showed that “only 29 percent of the entire state believe all of the allegations,” Gray noted, “that’s not even one in three and that’s Democrats and Republicans together.”

Trump won Alabama with 62 percent of the vote in last year’s general election and it gave him a dominating victory in the Republican presidential primary. He more than doubled the vote total of his nearest competitor, Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzTexas Republicans slam White House over disaster relief request Dem rep: Trump disaster aid request is 'how you let America down again' Moore endorsements disappear from campaign website MORE (R-Ala.).

Lawyers for Flynn have reportedly stopped sharing information about special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing probe with the White House, a move the Times notes could signal Flynn’s cooperation with the investigation or that he is in the process of negotiating some sort of legal deal. Flynn’s lawyers had been cooperating with Trump’s legal team, as defense teams often do, but recently notified the White House they could no longer discuss the investigation.

Such a move isn’t a definite sign Flynn is negotiating some sort of agreement. The Times report was based on information from four people familiar with the case, whose identities could not be revealed as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.

Flynn resigned from the Trump’s administration in February after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He has long had associations with Russia and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner in Moscow in 2015.

NBC News reported this month that Mueller’s team had enough evidence to bring charges against Flynn and his son, Michael G. Flynn, who served as his father’s chief of staff during the campaign.

The elder Flynn had previously signaled that he would not cooperate with a Senate intelligence committee investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in May. But the Times notes he may move to work with Mueller in an effort to save his son.

His cooperation would provide insight about Trump’s campaign and his early days in the White House.","senate intelligence committee

Joe Barton’s Explicit Photo Leak Could Be Revenge Porn,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-barton-revenge-porn_us_5a171883e4b0d4906caddd94?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1718fd140000024450f082.jpeg?cache=wfbllt8mt4&ops=1910_1000,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), who apologized on Wednesday after an explicit photo of him circulated on Twitter, could be the victim of revenge porn, according to a top legal expert.

The congressman, who said Capitol Police are investigating the case, appears to have sent the photo, along with other images, to a woman with whom he had a consensual sexual relationship. If the person who posted lewd images of the congressman is in Texas, where Barton represents a suburb of Dallas, it would be a “clear cut” violation of the state’s 2015 law criminalizing revenge porn, said Mark Zaid, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer.

“Legally speaking, as far as I’m concerned, Congressman Barton is a victim,” Zaid, who has handled revenge porn cases, told HuffPost by phone on Thursday.

Barton’s spokesman did not immediately reply to a HuffPost email requesting comment on Thursday.

In an interview published Wednesday in The Washington Post, an unnamed woman who said she had two sexual encounters with Barton, 68, over five years claimed he sent her intimate photos, videos and text messages. She said she did not post the photo ― a selfie from a low angle, showing Barton’s penis, belly and face ― but did share it with other people.

The right-wing conspiracy theory site InfoWars posted a video of Barton masturbating, which the unnamed woman also showed to The Washington Post, but the video appears to have taken it down.

Revenge porn refers to intimate photos posted online without the subject’s consent, often in retaliation after a consensual relationship ends negatively. California became the first state to make publishing revenge porn a crime in 2013. Now 38 states, plus the District of Columbia, outlaw revenge porn. The New York Senate passed a bill in June that would make revenge porn illegal, and the New York City Council voted this month to do the same, though neither has been signed into law.

Barton’s case comes during a time of intense scrutiny toward the personal sexual interactions of powerful men. Dozens of men ― including star Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, comedian Louis C.K. and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) ― have been accused of sexually harassing, assaulting, groping or raping women, particularly younger women over whose careers they wielded significant influence.

Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) is one of the most senior Republicans in the House.

Unless new details emerge that shift the narrative of Barton’s behavior in the relationship, his case marks a reversal of the typical pattern for revenge porn, in which men usually publish images in retribution, or extort money from the victims by threatening to post photos or videos. In the most recent high-profile case of alleged revenge porn, reality TV star Rob Kardashian posted explicit photos of a woman he claimed was Blac Chyna, his ex-girlfriend, amid a relationship feud.

“The law is gender neutral and the law should be enforced equally,” Zaid said. “Everyone should be just as incensed that this would happen to an older male as they would to a younger woman.”

He added: “You can factor in the morality and the politics of the situation and come to a different determination of how much empathy you want to give.”

The woman who received the images from Barton said she began a friendship with him in 2011 after he started messaging her on Facebook about shared political interests. He soon began to flirt, she told The Washington Post, and became sexually explicit: “He says to me, ‘Do you want me to send you a picture of myself?’ I said, ‘Oh no, no. Please do not do that.’ It kind of started there.”

In 2012, she met him in Washington, and they had sex. She met him again in Texas in 2014, where they had sex for a second and final time, she told the newspaper.

In 2015 ― the same year Texas banned revenge porn ― Barton threatened to call Capitol Police on her if she shared the images. According to a transcript of the phone call posted by The Washington Post, he said:

“I would tell them that I had a three-year undercover relationship with you over the internet that was heavily sexual and that I had met you twice while married and had sex with you on two different occasions and that I exchanged inappropriate photographs and videos with you that I wouldn’t like to be seen made public, that you still apparently had all of those and were in position to use them in a way that would negatively affect my career. That’s the truth.”

On Wednesday, Barton issued a statement saying reports in The Dallas Morning News and The Washington Post offered “evidence” of a “potential crime against me.” He said Capitol Police offered to launch an investigation, and he accepted.

“This woman admitted that we had a consensual relationship,” Barton said in the statement. “When I ended that relationship, she threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation.”

The former chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who now serves as vice chairman of the panel, is the fifth-longest-serving Republican in the House of Representatives. Now on his 17th term, he made a name for himself as a close ally to the oil and gas industry, earning the nickname “Smokey Joe.”

He’s a member of the Freedom Caucus, and boasts 100 percent ratings from conservative groups like the Family Research Council and the Christian Coalition for America for his opposition to abortion and LGBTQ rights. In 2010, Barton backed a policy platform that called for re-criminalizing sodomy in Texas.

The woman told The Washington Post she came forward to expose the congressman’s hypocrisy for advocating conservative family values while courting women online amid the dissolution of his second marriage.

“It’s not normal for a member of Congress who runs on a GOP platform of family values and conservatism to be scouring the internet looking for a new sexual liaison,” she said.

The leaked photos raise concerns about congressional security protocols, said Zaid, who works on national security issues. If a foreign intelligence officer had wooed the congressman into sharing compromising photos, then threatened to reveal them unless the lawmaker took actions favorable to the other country, “we could have had a much worse situation,” he said.","house energy and commerce committee

“I was trying to figure it out, was it a celebrity?” she told HuffPost. “Who does he remind me of?” He looked like her dad, she realized.

“When we landed and were waiting for the van to the hotel, I told him I’d figured it out,” she said. ”I told him, ‘You look like just my dad.’ I had a picture of him on my phone, which I showed to the first officer. ‘Doesn’t he look just like my dad?’” she recalled asking him. ”‘I think they look so similar.’”

The pilot’s response? ”‘It’s been a long time since a girl like you called me daddy,’” she said.

“I felt so grossed out. I turned and looked at the officer and gave him an expression like, ‘What just happened?’ And he just looked at me and shrugged. I remember thinking at the time that I must have said something inappropriate.”

Based on accounts shared with HuffPost from both current and former flight attendants, Bright’s story is among many instances of sexual harassment and assault in the skies. As more and more stories of sexual assault across industries come to the forefront, it’s impossible to ignore the dynamics of the airline industry, which are inherently gendered with origins in the sexualization of women.

From unwanted advances to groping and forced physical contact, assault and harassment are realities seemingly accepted as commonplace by the flight attendants we spoke with, all of whom attested to various levels of unwanted physical contact during their time on the job.

It’s what drives some people, like former flight attendant Lanelle Henderson, out.

Henderson worked for now-defunct Kiwi Airlines in the ’90s and again for a little under a year for now-defunct Airtran in 2004. She told HuffPost that it was her experience in the 2000s that turned her off from remaining in the industry.

Once, a male passenger who’d been drinking began making advances toward her throughout a flight to Dallas–Fort Worth, she told HuffPost.

“He would first grab my hand and compliment me, which in the beginning was flattering,” she said. “But then he grabbed and rubbed my leg. It was mostly embarrassing because the man behind him was looking at me as if to say, ‘What are you going to do?’ And I was just startled and a newbie and trying to be polite.”

Lanelle Henderson Henderson aboard an AirTrain flight during training for her time as a flight attendant for the airline in 2004.

Henderson said that the customer blocked her in the galley from moving between cabins. He eventually grabbed her butt. “The man behind him said, ‘Sir, enough already. This girl is not here for your pleasure.’” she said.

Flight attendants told HuffPost that the “customer is always right” attitude mandated by much of the service industry often prevents many flight attendants from confronting in-flight harassment themselves, Henderson said.

They’re not going to stop the plane. And then everyone’s going to be mad at you; you’re not a team player, you’re difficult.

Dawn Arthur also became disillusioned during eight years working as a flight attendant in both the commercial and private sector.

“I was really excited [before I became a flight attendant],” she said. “I thought it was so cool. But then you find out that there is no support in the industry. The pilots aren’t trained to handle assault and they don’t want to hear it. It’s not their job.”

Arthur, who told HuffPost she’s been “pushed into a corner and felt up” by passengers, said flight attendants may feel discouraged from taking action in order to avoid an in-flight delay or disturbance.

“If someone grabs you or threatens you, nothing is going to happen. They’re on a tight timetable. They’re not going to stop the plane. And then everyone’s going to be mad at you; you’re not a team player, you’re difficult.”

If there is a trend of keeping assault to oneself in the airline industry, former flight attendant Mandalena Lewis has broken it in a big way. She has not only spoken about her own alleged assault but is in the midst of a lawsuit against her former employer, Canadian airline WestJet, in part, she said, for firing her as a result.

According to Lewis, the company neglected to adequately handle not only her experience with sexual assault in 2010, but with a group of women she is now representing in her case.

Lewis recounted her assault to HuffPost, which happened during a layover in Maui in 2010. She said the incident ultimately led her to firing and discovery of other women who made claims against the same pilot who she said attacked her.

“We were on a layover in Maui, and the whole crew went out for dinner and drinks, totally standard,” she said. “The captain invited people up to his room. It was my second year of being a flight attendant and I was down to go up to the room and have a drink. I ended up going by myself. The first officer’s room was right next door and their door was open a bit.”

Lewis said the pilot had been acting “very father-like” up until that point, when the two of them went on the balcony. “There was nothing inappropriate and I didn’t send him any signals,” she said. “On the balcony, he started asking me really inappropriate questions: do I touch myself privately, do I masturbate, things like that.”

When she turned to leave, that’s when she said the pilot started to attack her. “It started almost like horseplay, gradually becoming more aggressive,” she said. Lewis said he attacked her three times. The first and second involved grabbing her from behind, squeezing her arms and commenting on how strong she was.

“The third time, he grabbed me and put me on the bed and got between my legs,” she said. “He touched my face and told me I wanted it and how strong I was.”

Lewis said she got her heels underneath him and kicked him off of her. “He fell backward into the TV stand. I was shaking, tears were coming down my face.” Lewis said that the airline took her off of flights with the pilot but did not take action to fire him.

It was in 2015 when she says she spoke up about the lack of training surrounding sexual assault during a crew resource management class. She said her concerns were brushed off by the person leading the training, but there were a few people who came over afterward and thanked her for speaking out.

“A few months later, I was on a layover in Toronto and I got a Facebook message from a woman who told me she was in the room during the training,” she said. “She asked if she could call me to tell me her story.”

“Sure enough, she told me that she was raped in 2008 by the same pilot. We didn’t know each others’ stories and we didn’t know each other,” she said.

Lewis told HuffPost both hired lawyers pretty quickly after that, but the other woman later settled with the company. “We dropped the class-action suit and I went forward as an individual case for wrongful dismissal and negligence” in early 2016.

The airline has disputed the claims — as recently as Nov. 9, saying employees should be bringing their cases “to human rights tribunals and workers’ compensation boards instead” of filing a lawsuit, according to Global News. Robert Palmer, manager of public relations for WestJet, declined to comment on “ongoing legal proceedings,” but said the company is “committed to fostering a harassment-free workplace where all employees are treated with respect and dignity.”

While the demographics for flight attendants vary slightly by airline and have shifted over the years, the industry is still majority female ― about 80 percent. But men in the field say they’ve also dealt with unwanted advances.

A male JetBlue flight attendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told HuffPost he has been grabbed inappropriately multiple times by both men and women. Passengers commonly make comments referring to the mile-high club and “getting him in the back of the plane.”

In the event that a situation escalates, flight crew can notify the pilot, who will decide whether it is necessary to take action, either by speaking to the passenger themselves or, in extreme cases, removing the person from the flight. “Ten out of 10 times they have our side, but diverting and removing a person from the flight is obviously our last option,” he said.

For the people we spoke to, shrugging inappropriate behavior off had become commonplace. Many said even if they wanted to do something about it, the training isn’t there.

Sara Nelson is the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA as well as a 21-year flight attendant with United Airlines. She told HuffPost that in her experience ― along with the experience of some of the 50,000 flight attendants across the 20 airlines the association represents ― there is no exact protocol on how to handle it.

“There is very little training. It’s nonexistent, actually,” she said. “There is training on how to handle assault and aggressive behavior on a plane, but there is no recognition of sexual assault as a unique crime.”

She added that for a flight attendant tasked with getting a job done, it’s easier to just keep things moving than to confront a passenger or bring it to the pilot’s attention.

“One, it’s a confined space, where flight attendants are charged with de-escalating conflict every single day,” she said. “I had a conversation with a group of flight attendants ranging from six months seniority to 10 years on Friday and the conversation basically was, ‘We have to de-escalate everything and sometimes I just choose not to say anything.’ ‘If someone grabs my butt or pulls me onto their lap, I tell them to knock it off and keep going.’”

If allegations in other industries have pushed the conversation forward to put an end to assault, it has also emboldened people who Nelson say feel like they’re “out of the public eye” in the air.

“A flight attendant relayed a situation this week where a guy in the last few rows spoke up and said, ‘When can we get some drinks around here, honey?’” she said. While the flight attendant was still in earshot, Nelson said he loudly added, “‘You can probably get sued for calling someone honey nowadays,’” laughing with the men sitting around him.

Nelson told HuffPost she thinks things have perhaps gotten worse since she started in 1996, due to planes these days being more crowded than ever and equipped with less staff. “In a casual request from our membership about what’s happening today on the plane, we were barraged with examples,” she said.

Flight attendants who worked in the ’60s and ’70s might argue the notion that it is worse, now, though. A Facebook group titled Stewardesses of the 1960s and 1970s, which boasts more than 9,000 members, has a recently posted thread asking members about sexual assault that currently has more than 400 comments.

In spite of the frequency of sexual assault in the air, Nelson told HuffPost that she thinks the CEOs of airlines (most of whom are men) would be “shocked” to find out what’s going on on their planes.

“Men don’t think about this stuff,” she said. “It’s not their experience. They have no idea what it’s like. And even if they are someone who doesn’t participate, I bet if these men are really going to be honest, even the ones who would never do it themselves, have absolutely been sitting there and have done nothing while it’s happening.”

Still, Nelson has hope. “Any time an issue is raised, there is opportunity for change, but I think we are just at the very beginning of the conversation here,” she said, adding, “It doesn’t have to be this way. The more we talk about it and say it’s not OK, the better it will get.”","attendantscwa sara nelson international

What would we do?”,2017-11-22T10:45:30Z,the-huffington-post,Trump Administration Is Sending Haitians Back To A Country Still Mired In Disaster,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/haiti-tps-protections_us_5a14b33ce4b09650540e1bdb?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a14b4fd140000891d50ebbe.jpeg?cache=rdosffiwsu&ops=1910_1000,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The Trump administration has ended immigration protections for thousands of Haitians in the U.S. starting in 18 months, which will force many to abandon the lives and communities they’ve built to return to a country still recovering from disaster.

Senior Trump administration officials announced Monday the upcoming end of temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitians, a special designation applied to 59,000 Haitians after a massive earthquake devastated the island nation in 2010. Unless Congress takes action, Haitian TPS recipients will have to achieve legal status or return to Haiti by July 2019 ― or risk deportation.

Haitian TPS recipients have been living in the U.S. for 13 years on average, according to the Center for Migration Studies. They also have 27,000 U.S.-born children. Those parents may soon have to decide whether to take their children to Haiti ― for some, a country they have never known ― or leave them behind.

“I’ve never been to Haiti before,” said Ronyde Christina Ponthieux, the 10-year-old daughter of two TPS recipients, at a Tuesday news conference organized by the nonprofit Haitian Women of Miami. “I have trouble sleeping at night sometimes, because I know there is a possibility me and my family will be deported.”

“I love my dad, I love my parents,” she added, bursting into tears. “How can you do this to us?”

I have trouble sleeping at night sometimes, because I know there is a possibility me and my family will be deported. Ronyde Christina Ponthieux, the 10-year-old daughter of Haitians with protected status

What’s more, Haiti ― the poorest country in the Western hemisphere ― is in no condition to receive thousands of arrivals, experts warn.

The country has still not fully recovered from the 2010 earthquake, which killed more than 300,000 people and devastated the country’s infrastructure. The disaster also left the nation with an ongoing cholera epidemic after U.N. peacekeepers, who were there to assist with rescue efforts, brought the disease to the country. Since then, it has also been hit by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as well as Maria in September.

“Since the earthquake, there’s been a series of natural disasters, not to mention a cholera outbreak,” Kevin Appleby, senior director at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies think tank, told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Sixty percent [of Haitians] are below the poverty line. You still have 10,000 cases of cholera as of September. There’s still thousands displaced or in camps. Infrastructure has been weakened by the hurricanes. Crops have been damaged, so there’s food insecurity and hunger is prevalent.

“You add those things up, the leadership is not in a position to safely reintegrate many of these people.”

Carlos Garcia Rawlins / Reuters The Haiti home of Prenille Nord and his children was destroyed by Hurricane Matthew on Oct. 17. ""I have nothing left. Now we are homeless and I'm currently living in a shelter with my family,"" Nord said. Despite the destruction and cholera on the island, the Trump administration plans to send many Haitians in the U.S. back by July 2019.

While Haitians under TPS still have 18 months to attain long-term immigration status before they are subject to deportation, getting legal status in the U.S. is far from easy or fast.

Some Haitians could have a spouse petition for them ― but only if their partner is a permanent resident or U.S. citizen, Appleby noted. Others could have an employer petition, but that would work only if the employer could prove that an American couldn’t fill the job. Most Haitians will likely not have either of these options.

“Absent action by Congress to give this population a chance for permanence, I would say the vast majority would be subject to deportation,” Appleby said.

He called for members of the legal community to step up to support Haitians in these complex immigration processes ― at an affordable cost.

The administration is doing more to increase illegal immigration in this country than decrease it. Kevin Appleby, senior director at the Center for Migration Studies

The end of TPS protections for Haitians comes mere weeks after the Trump administration ended the same special protections for over 5,000 Nicaraguans, some of whom had been living in the U.S. for close to two decades.

It has also only been a couple months since President Donald Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants ― also known as Dreamers ― at risk of being deported when their protections expire.

“This is part of a broader strategy being pursued by this administration not only to deport undocumented immigrants but to roll back legal protections for long-term residents and subject them to deportation,” Appleby said. “In fact, the administration is doing more to increase illegal immigration in this country than decrease it.”

“If you count Dreamers and TPS, you’re approaching a million people they’re throwing into undocumented status,” he added. “They won’t be able to deport them all, but it drives them into the shadows.”

On Tuesday, protesters took to the streets in Florida, marching to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home to protest the decision to roll back TPS protections for Haitians.

“Right now I am very depressed to know that after 18 months I have to go back,” Yolnick Jeune, a TPS recipient and mother of five children, who has been in the U.S. for over 10 years, said at the Haitian Women of Miami’s news conference. “With TPS, I was able to go to school. I’m a school district employee for seven years. I have two boys that went to college. I have two girls that are going to graduate this year.”","carlos garcia rawlins reuters

Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, are said to have terminated an information-sharing agreement with the president’s legal team.",2017-11-23T21:17:47Z,the-huffington-post,A Split From Trump Indicates That Flynn Is Moving to Cooperate With Mueller,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/politics/flynn-mueller-russia-trump.html?_r=0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/24/us/24-flynn/merlin_129715607_282ab574-d5be-41d7-91ed-643f78199e88-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Lawyers for Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump declined to comment. The four people briefed on the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

A deal with Mr. Flynn would give Mr. Mueller a behind-the-scenes look at the Trump campaign and the early tumultuous weeks of the administration. Mr. Flynn was an early and important adviser to Mr. Trump, an architect of Mr. Trump’s populist “America first” platform and an advocate of closer ties with Russia.

His ties to Russia predated the campaign — he sat with President Vladimir V. Putin at a 2015 event in Moscow — and he was a point person on the transition team for dealing with Russia.

The White House had been bracing for charges against Mr. Flynn in recent weeks, particularly after charges were filed against three other former Trump associates: Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman; Rick Gates, a campaign aide; and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser.

But none of those men match Mr. Flynn in stature, or in his significance to Mr. Trump. A retired three-star general, Mr. Flynn was an early supporter of Mr. Trump’s and a valued surrogate for a candidate who had no foreign policy experience. Mr. Trump named him national security adviser, he said, to help “restore America’s leadership position in the world.”

Among the interactions that Mr. Mueller is investigating is a private meeting that Mr. Flynn had with the Russian ambassador and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, during the presidential transition. In the past year, it has been revealed that people with ties to Russia repeatedly sought to meet with Trump campaign officials, sometimes dangling the promise of compromising information on Mrs. Clinton.

Mr. Flynn is regarded as loyal to Mr. Trump, but he has in recent weeks expressed serious concerns to friends that prosecutors will bring charges against his son, Michael Flynn Jr., who served as his father’s chief of staff and was a part of several financial deals involving the elder Mr. Flynn that Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing.

The White House has said that neither Mr. Flynn nor other former aides have incriminating information to provide about Mr. Trump. “He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel,” a White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said in an interview last month with The New York Times. “I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments. But to the extent that that happens, that’s beyond his control.”

Mr. Flynn was supposed to have been the cornerstone of Mr. Trump’s national security team. Instead, he was forced out after a month in office over his conversations with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn’s handling of those conversations fueled suspicion that people around Mr. Trump had concealed their dealings with Russians, worsening a controversy that has hung over the president’s first year in office.

Four days after Mr. Trump was sworn in, the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Flynn at the White House about his calls with the ambassador. American intelligence and law enforcement agencies became so concerned about Mr. Flynn’s conversations and false statements about them to Vice President Mike Pence that the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that Mr. Flynn might be compromised.

The conversations with the Russian ambassador that led to Mr. Flynn’s undoing took place during the presidential transition. When questions about them surfaced, Mr. Flynn told Mr. Pence that they had exchanged only holiday greetings — the conversations happened in late December, around the time that the Obama administration was announcing sanctions against Russia.

While Mr. Pence and White House press officers repeated the holiday-greetings claim publicly, Mr. Flynn and the ambassador had in fact discussed the sanctions. That invited the idea that the incoming administration was trying to undermine the departing president and curry favor with Moscow.

Mr. Trump sought Mr. Flynn’s resignation only after news broke that Mr. Flynn had been interviewed by F.B.I. agents and that Ms. Yates had warned the White House that his false statements could make him vulnerable to Russian blackmail.

Since then, Mr. Flynn’s legal problems have grown. It was revealed that he failed to list payments from Russia-linked entities on financial disclosure forms. He did not mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia.

The former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, has testified before Congress that Mr. Trump asked him to end the government’s investigation into Mr. Flynn in a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office the day after Mr. Flynn was fired. Mr. Trump’s request caused great concern for Mr. Comey, who immediately wrote a memo about his meeting with the president.

And investigators working for Mr. Mueller have questioned witnesses about whether Mr. Flynn was secretly paid by the Turkish government during the presidential campaign. Mr. Flynn belatedly disclosed, after leaving the White House, that the Turkish government had paid him more than $500,000.

Mr. Flynn’s firing was, in some ways, the first domino that set off a cascade of problems for Mr. Trump. After the president ousted Mr. Comey, news surfaced that the president had requested an end to the Flynn inquiry, a revelation that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. That, in turn, raised the profile of an investigation that the president had tried mightily to contain.","view all new york times

The European Union’s Schengen Area, a group of 26 countries that allow visa-free travel, placed a five-year travel ban on Spencer this week, Poland’s state-run news agency PAP said.

“I’m being treated like a criminal by the Polish government. It’s just insane,” Spencer told the AP on Wednesday. “I haven’t done anything. What are they accusing me of?”

Last month, Poland expressed its opposition to Spencer’s plan to attend a seminar organized around the country’s independence day and an international right-wing conference.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses its strong opposition to visits to Poland by individuals who propagate views that are based on racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic ideas,” it said in a statement.

Spencer told the AP he decided to cancel his travel plans because “it just didn’t feel like it was worth it.”

He was previously banned from the Schengen Area for three years after he attempted to host a white nationalist conference in Hungary in 2014. Spencer ended up being arrested and imprisoned for three days before being deported, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.","european union’s schengen area a

During a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall, Kenney called out the White House for having “no compassion whatsoever” with its decision to remove the “temporary protected status” designation for Haitians by July 2019.

The status gives people from certain war-ravaged or natural disaster-hit countries permission to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. Haiti was left devastated by an earthquake in 2010.

The Trump administration’s move, announced Monday, would force almost 59,000 Haitians to either achieve legal status in the U.S., return home, leave for another country or remain in America without documentation.

Kenney called Trump’s immigration policies “simply un-American” and said the president himself should “get out” of the country.

“I’m just beside myself with with sadness because our president is a bully, our president is a punk and he just doesn’t get it,” he added.","trump administration’s move

Dominique Mosbergen,"An abnormal sound ""consistent with an explosion"" was detected near where the vessel disappeared last week, said the Argentine navy.",2017-11-23T16:58:37Z,the-huffington-post,The Mysterious Disappearance Of An Argentine Navy Sub Just Got Even Stranger,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/argentina-missing-submarine-what-we-know_us_5a16ea55e4b0d4906cada57d?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a16f229140000024450f018.jpeg?cache=ahwnz2rjro&ops=1910_1000,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"As the desperate, multinational search for a missing Argentine submarine continues, the country’s navy said on Thursday that a sound “consistent with an explosion” had been detected near the site where the vessel disappeared last week with 44 crew members on board.

Captain Enrique Balbi, a navy spokesman, said an “abnormal, singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event” had been detected in the South Atlantic ocean on the morning of Nov. 15. That was around the same time the ARA San Juan sent out its last signal, reported Reuters.

The search for the missing vessel, which has enough air to last only seven to 10 days if fully immersed, has been intensifying as several countries participate in a massive search covering some 187,000 square miles.

Here’s what we know about the search so far:

When did the San Juan last make contact?

The last communication between the diesel-electric powered submarine and onshore authorities was at 7.30 a.m. on Nov. 15. The vessel had been heading from the southern port of Ushuaia to a naval base in Mar del Plata, about 260 miles south of Buenos Aires. It had been scheduled to arrive at its destination on Sunday.

Shortly before disappearing, the San Juan’s captain reported a battery failure due to a “short circuit” on board. He later said the issue had been fixed.

According to the Argentine navy, such failures are considered routine and the vessel’s crew had been reported safe at the time, per CNN. Still, the captain was reportedly ordered to change course and take a more direct route to Mar del Plata.

On Saturday, the Argentine Defense Ministry said it had detected seven communication attempts from the San Juan. That, however, turned out to be untrue.

What could have happened?

The submarine’s apparent failure to use any distress signals or mechanisms has troubled experts because it suggests the submarine could have been “quickly and devastatingly incapacitated by a cataclysmic event onboard,” noted the Los Angeles Times.

William Craig Reed, a former U.S. Navy diver and submarine expert, told CNN that the submarine could have suffered some sort of “catastrophic failure” or it “could be something minor that has caused them to either be hung up somewhere or they are on the bottom.”

The Argentine navy said on Thursday that there was no sign the submarine had been attacked.

How is the search effort going?

Thousands of military personnel, more than a dozen aircraft and 15 vessels from countries including Brazil, Britain, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Peru, the United States and Uruguay are searching for the vessel.

Finding a submarine, which is difficult to detect by design, is significantly more challenging than locating a surface vessel, experts say.

The search has also be hampered by poor weather, with storms causing strong winds and waves of up to 20 feet in the search area.

How long can the submarine last at sea?

Balbi, the Argentine navy spokesman, said the submarine has enough food, water, fuel and oxygen to operate for 90 days without external help. However, that only applies if the vessel can raise a snorkel to the surface “to charge batteries and draw fresh air for the crew.”

If the submarine has been fully submerged and unable to surface, its oxygen supply may only last about seven days.

Wednesday marked the seventh day since the vessel disappeared.","colombia france germany peru

Travis Waldron,Donald Trump is just keeping with a long tradition in this country.,2017-11-23T10:45:45Z,the-huffington-post,There’s A Reason Powerful Americans Love To Attack Black Sports Figures,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-america-black-athletes_us_5a15db6ce4b064948072a8c4?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a15dc241800005acef6d9f6.jpeg?ops=1910_1000,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Powerful white Americans have been scoring political points off black athletes for as long as there have been organized sports in America. In this respect, at least, Donald Trump is a traditionalist.

On Wednesday, Trump renewed his feud with LaVar Ball, the father of one of three UCLA players arrested in China on suspicion of shoplifting early this month. Ball stands accused of showing insufficient gratitude to the president for having secured the release of his son, along with the other players.

It wasn’t the White House, it wasn’t the State Department, it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2017

...LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2017

Over the weekend, Trump returned to another hobbyhorse of his, blasting Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch for refusing to stand for the U.S. national anthem before a game in Mexico City on Sunday. Lynch, the president noted (while calling for Lynch’s suspension), had stood for the Mexican anthem at the same game. In Wednesday morning’s string of tweets, Trump also continued to slam the NFL’s handling of the protests against racial inequality that began with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last year.

Ball and Lynch, like the other sports-related figures who have drawn Trump’s ire, are black. The president is merely working from a familiar playbook: He’s goosing his small but fervent base of supporters by attacking black sports figures who have dared to cross him. Trump, as he has in the past, would surely declare that there is no racial motivation to his criticism, but all the familiar code words are there. Ball is an “ungrateful fool,” Trump said. Lynch showed “great disrespect” to a country that has allowed him to become a wealthy professional football player.

If this has become a familiar routine for Trump, it is because it is a familiar one for America. The country has never been comfortable with assertive black sports figures. Despite all the caterwauling about athletes who refuse to “stick to sports,” powerful Americans have always understood the mere presence of black athletes to be fundamentally political, a threat to the larger project of black subordination. And if black athletes themselves could no longer be kept out of sports, the culture at large would have to circumscribe their behavior, crush any outward assertiveness, segregate their blackness.

Allen Berezovsky via Getty Images Trump has feuded with LaVar Ball, the father of one of the UCLA players arrested on suspicion of shoplifting in China earlier this month.

By the time slavery was abolished, professional baseball had a number of black players and teams who competed capably against and alongside whites, and the sport had already taken on political significance: in 1859, a liberal Republican congressman from Ohio appeared in an integrated game to protest slavery and segregation.

Whereas some newspapers at the time saw the game as capable of promulgating the destruction of racial and social barriers, baseball in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw itself as part of the effort “to preserve a familiar social order” dominated by whites. So shortly after the Civil War, one of the first bans on black players was enacted against the Philadelphia Pythians, an all-black team formed in 1867. By the end of the 1880s, baseball fully mirrored and advanced the horrors of Jim Crow society around it, with “gentlemen’s agreements” between white owners and players that prohibited the signing of black players.

The founders of the Pythians, who found success against some of Philadelphia’s all-white teams, saw baseball as “literally another field upon which African Americans could assert their skills and independence, and prove their right to full citizenship and equality.” But the National Association of Base Ball Players, in implementing the ban against the Pythians and any team that had a black player, thwarted that effort, arguing that “if colored clubs were admitted there would be, in all probability, some division of feeling, whereas by excluding them no injury could result to anyone.”

The ban, the association said, could also help the Philadelphia baseball convention, where the decision to ban black players was made, avoid “the discussion of any subject having a political bearing.” That is, the popular “stick to sports” refrain was used more than a century ago as part of an effort to eradicate black men from professional baseball, segregating them from a sport that was fast becoming one of America’s most culturally and economically relevant industries.

Black baseball still thrived, but the ban, which came even earlier than the Supreme Court’s Plessy v. Ferguson ruling that institutionalized segregation across America, helped set the stage for the sort of separate-but-equal mantra that plagued the country for decades. Baseball became a tool for segregating public spaces, too: Georgia, for instance, passed a statute that prohibited black and white people from playing the sport at public parks within two blocks of each other.

Where baseball beat America to re-codifying segregation into law, the other major sport of the time ― boxing ― followed it, and did so even more directly. Jack Johnson, the black boxing champion, became an avatar of black brutality and menace who, in the eyes of white America, required direct political action to counter. Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion in 1908; four years later, Georgia Rep. Seaborn Roddenbery introduced an anti-miscegenation constitutional amendment that specifically cited Johnson ― who was twice married to white women ― as an example of the “villainous character” and “atrocious qualities” of interracial marriage. (It never became law, but state anti-miscegenation laws weren’t fully repealed until the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in 1967.)

Even before Johnson won his title, a black boxer named Joe Gans pummeled a white fighter to win the light heavyweight championship in Baltimore. In response, the city moved to reform its boxing laws, and banned black and white fighters from meeting each other in the ring, as author Lou Moore wrote in his 2017 book about the history of black boxing, I Fight for a Living.

Baltimore was, at the time, one of America’s blackest cities, and “whites feared that the combination of Gans’s championship status, his standing in the black community, and prowess in the ring would have a damaging effect on their ability to control black citizens,” Moore wrote. “Baltimore could not be a ‘White Man’s City’ with a black champion who beat up white men.”

Similar bans were enacted after black boxing victories in Louisiana, Missouri, Los Angeles and Louisville, Kentucky, among other cities and states, all in an effort to limit black participation in sports, local communities and politics, as Moore documents in his book. By 1910, the bans on white vs. black boxing matches had even spread to Great Britain, where politicians feared such matches “could incite black unrest in the empire and erode the mythology of white supremacy.”

The point of all of this was easy to see: if black athletes could assert themselves in the ring or on the baseball field, black people could assert themselves everywhere else, too. If black athletes weren’t forced to stay in their place, black people wouldn’t be compelled, either. And so laws were passed, and policies were implemented, to ensure the absence of black athletes who could give voice to black people.

Baseball’s color barrier, of course, collapsed in 1947, and boxing’s most discriminatory policies were either abandoned or thrown out in courts. So the methods of limiting black expression in sports evolved: Muhammad Ali was sentenced to prison and stripped of his title for being a black man who refused to fight in the Vietnam War. The U.S. Olympic Committee, amid political and societal outrage, kicked Tommie Smith and John Carlos off the Olympic team after their Black Power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Games. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges were ostracized and blackballed from the NBA for protesting America’s racial inequalities, much as Kaepernick has been today.

Trump’s method of breathless tweetstorms may be new. But his demands are the same ones white America has always made. LaVar Ball and the UCLA basketball players must either display quiet fealty to the president, or get told they should be imprisoned in China. Marshawn Lynch should stand for the national anthem, and Jemele Hill refrain from criticizing the president, or face immediate calls for their firing.

Black sports figures must always know their place, so that black Americans will, too.","vietnam war the us olympic committee

A Union Wants It in Writing.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/politics/corporate-tax-cut-pay.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/24/us/24dc-taxceo/merlin_130150173_09a0d1ac-f111-468b-ac9e-461846eca58e-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Labor groups are wondering the same thing — and are seizing on the administration’s economic analysis that the tax cut will translate into an extra $4,000 in take-home pay for workers.

This week, the Communications Workers of America asked several companies that employ its members to promise to give workers a pay increase if the cut in the corporate tax rate goes through. The request, while unlikely to be heeded, highlights a critical question over who would benefit the most from the tax bill: shareholders or workers?

“President Trump and the Republican Congress have been trying to sell this corporate tax cut to working families by making big claims about wage increases, investment and job growth that don’t seem to be supported by the evidence,” said Chris Shelton, the president of the union. “We’re going straight to the people who know how corporations plan to spend the billions of dollars being handed over to them — the C.E.O.s — and asking them if they intend to keep the promises that Trump is making on their behalf.”

Business leaders and their lobbying groups, including the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the tax bill will increase economic growth, profits and worker pay. Four out of five executives in a survey by the round table earlier this year said they would increase capital spending if Congress were to pass a tax package, while three in four said they would increase hiring.

Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the Business Roundtable, told the Economic Club of Chicago this week that if Congress had already passed a tax overhaul bill, “some companies would have made huge investments.”

“We know one thing for sure: Investments drive productivity, drives jobs and wages,” he added.

Mr. Trump has put a number on it, saying a typical American would see a $4,000 raise if the corporate rate was reduced to 20 percent from a high of 35 percent today, as both the House-passed bill and the pending Senate version propose. His Council of Economic Advisers says the increase could go as high as $9,000 for the average household.

President Trump’s top economist, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said last week that he expected corporations to invest heavily and raise workers’ wages if the tax bill became law. When most developed nations have cut their corporate tax rate, he said, the resulting wage increases were “well north” of $4,000 per year for workers.

But Democrats and liberal economists dispute those claims, citing research that suggests that the bulk of the benefits from corporate cuts will flow to the rich, partly through companies’ buying back stock or increasing dividend payments to shareholders.

A prominent survey of top economists from across the ideological spectrum — the IGM Economic Experts Panel — found this week that almost no economists agreed with the notion that the size of the American economy “will be substantially higher a decade from now than under the status quo” if the tax bill passed.

Critics note that wage growth has remained relatively sluggish over the past several years, even as corporate profits hover near all-time highs as a share of the economy, and the unemployment rate continues to fall to levels that economists normally associate with rapid increases in worker pay.

“Perhaps the most intuitive reason we know these cuts will fail to spark wage growth is that corporate profit rates have been historically high since 2007, while business investment has been historically low,” Josh Bivens, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, wrote this week.

In a letter sent this week to the top executives of Verizon, AT&T and six other companies, the communications union asked them to pledge a $4,000 annual pay increase for employees for every year that the corporate rate rests at 20 percent. The union, which has called the tax measure “an outrageous money grab” and urged lawmakers to reject it, also asked the companies to say that they will not take advantage of other changes in the corporate code to send American jobs to other countries.

The companies largely declined to comment or dismissed the letter as a stunt.

Jim Gerace, chief communications officer for Verizon, said that the company would take up the wage issue with the union when contract negotiations begin in 2019, “regardless of the outcome of tax reform legislation,” and that “it’s just too early to speak to the impacts on our business” from the tax bill.

AT&T — which has promised to invest an additional $1 billion in the United States if the tax bill passes, a rare level of detail for a corporation — issued a statement that noted: “We’ve said that with the passage of a tax bill that includes a permanent corporate tax rate of 20 percent, we’ll increase our investment in the United States. Research tells us that each $1 billion invested in the telecom sector creates about 7,000 jobs, which means 7,000 new wage earners.”

It is possible that a tax cut could increase wages even if companies do not intend it to, particularly in the current economic environment, where unemployment is hovering just above 4 percent. Most economists consider that rate to be an indication that the economy is running close to full capacity. As companies compete more to hire individual workers, they should be able to bargain for higher wages.

Administration officials appear to believe that individual companies are reluctant to describe how they would use the proceeds from a tax cut to invest and hire workers, despite their lobbying groups’ aggressive promotion of the job-creation benefits of the bill.

“My guess is, if I’m a Fortune 500 C.E.O., I’m not going to tell my competitors, who are sitting in the aisle next to me, what I’m going to do next year,” the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday morning. “They’re going to do what’s in their best interest.”","communications

Average tax rates for the $10,000 - $20,000 income group The initial analysis found a tax increase for low-income groups: 2027 0.7% Senate bill 2019 –0.7% –0.8% –1.0% Current law The second took out the effects of the individual mandate repeal: 2027 0.7% Senate bill 2019 –0.5% –0.7% –0.8% –1.0% Current law –1.2% Senate bill without repeal effects Average tax rates for the $10,000 - $20,000 income group The initial analysis found a tax increase for low-income groups: The second took out the effects of the individual mandate repeal: 2027 2027 0.7% 0.7% Senate bill Senate bill 2019 2019 –0.5% –0.7% –0.7% –0.8% –0.8% –1.0% –1.0% Current law Current law –1.2% Senate bill without repeal effects

The reason that estimated tax rates are higher when the repeal is considered is because without a requirement to purchase health insurance, many would choose not to buy coverage. As a result, those without insurance would forgo the federal tax credits available to subsidize their insurance premiums.

Republicans, and some tax experts, say the choice to not take a tax credit is not an increase in tax burden and therefore should not be considered a tax increase.

Without the effects of the A.C.A. changes, average tax rates would initially fall for all income groups under the Senate plan. But the individual tax cuts are temporary, expiring at the end of 2025 in order to keep the plan within budget limits under Senate rules. (Corporate tax cuts in the bill do not expire, which explains the differences after 2025.)

Average Tax Rates Under Current Law vs. the Senate Tax Plan $20,000 - $30,000 $30,000 - $40,000 $50,000 - $75,000 $10,000 - $20,000 $40,000 - $50,000 14.8% Current 14.5% 7.9% Senate bill with effects of mandate repeal 11.1% Current 7.7% Current 10.9% 4.2% 11.0% 7.6% 3.9% –0.5% Current –0.7% 4.1% 7.2% Senate bill Senate bill 13.5% Current Senate bill –0.8% 10.0% 3.4% Senate bill –1.2% Senate bill 2019 2027 More than $1 million $75,000 - $100,000 $100,000 - $200,000 $200,000 - $500,000 $500,000 - $1 million 17.0% 20.9% Current Current Current 32.5% 26.6% 30.9% Current 20.7% 26.4% 30.8% Current 32.1% 16.3% 26.5% 30.5% 20.6% 31.7% Senate bill Senate bill 15.7% 19.5% Senate bill Senate bill 2019 2027 30.4% 24.2% Senate bill 27.8% $20,000 - $30,000 $30,000 - $40,000 $50,000 - $75,000 $10,000 - $20,000 $40,000 - $50,000 14.8% Current Senate bill with effects of mandate repeal 14.5% 7.9% 11.1% 7.7% Current 10.9% Current 4.2% 11.0% 7.6% 3.9% –0.5% Current –0.7% 4.1% 7.2% Senate bill Senate bill 13.5% Current Senate bill 10.0% –0.8% 3.4% Senate bill –1.2% Senate bill 2019 2027 More than $1 million $75,000 - $100,000 $100,000 - $200,000 $200,000 - $500,000 $500,000 - $1 million 17.0% 20.9% 32.5% 26.6% Current Current Current 30.9% 20.7% Current 26.4% 30.8% Current 32.1% 26.5% 16.3% 20.6% 30.5% 31.7% Senate bill Senate bill 15.7% 19.5% Senate bill 2019 2027 Senate bill 30.4% Senate bill 24.2% 27.8% $20,000 - $30,000 $30,000 - $40,000 $10,000 - $20,000 Senate bill with effects of mandate repeal 7.9% Current 7.7% 4.2% 7.6% 3.9% –0.5% Current –0.7% 4.1% 7.2% Senate bill Current –0.8% 3.4% Senate bill –1.2% Senate bill 2019 2027 $75,000 - $100,000 $50,000 - $75,000 $40,000 - $50,000 14.8% Current 14.5% 17.0% 11.1% Current Current 10.9% 16.3% 11.0% Senate bill 13.5% Senate bill 10.0% Senate bill 15.7% 2019 2027 $100,000 - $200,000 $200,000 - $500,000 $500,000 - $1 million 20.9% Current Current Current 26.6% 30.9% 20.7% 26.4% 30.8% 26.5% 20.6% 30.5% Senate bill 19.5% Senate bill 24.2% Senate bill 2019 2027 27.8% More than $1 million 32.5% Current 32.1% 31.7% Senate bill 30.4% 2019 2027 $20,000 - $30,000 $30,000 - $40,000 $10,000 - $20,000 Senate bill with effects of mandate repeal 7.9% 7.7% Current 4.2% 7.6% 3.9% –0.5% Current –0.7% 4.1% 7.2% Senate bill Current –0.8% 3.4% Senate bill –1.2% Senate bill 2019 2027 $75,000 - $100,000 $50,000 - $75,000 $40,000 - $50,000 14.8% Current 14.5% 17.0% 11.1% Current 10.9% Current 16.3% 11.0% Senate bill 13.5% Senate bill 10.0% Senate bill 15.7% 2019 2027 $100,000 - $200,000 $200,000 - $500,000 $500,000 - $1 million 20.9% 26.6% Current Current Current 30.9% 20.7% 26.4% 30.8% 26.5% 20.6% 30.5% Senate bill 19.5% Senate bill 2019 2027 Senate bill 24.2% 27.8% More than $1 million 32.5% Current 32.1% 31.7% Senate bill 30.4% $20,000 - $30,000 $10,000 - $20,000 Senate bill with effects of mandate repeal 4.2% 3.9% –0.5% Current –0.7% 4.1% Current –0.8% 3.4% Senate bill –1.2% Senate bill 2019 2027 $30,000 - $40,000 $40,000 - $50,000 7.9% 11.1% 7.7% Current 10.9% Current 11.0% 7.6% 7.2% Senate bill Senate bill 10.0% 2019 2027 $75,000 - $100,000 $50,000 - $75,000 14.8% Current 14.5% 17.0% Current 16.3% Senate bill 13.5% Senate bill 15.7% 2019 2027 $100,000 - $200,000 $200,000 - $500,000 20.9% 26.6% Current Current 20.7% 26.4% 26.5% 20.6% Senate bill 19.5% Senate bill 24.2% 2019 2027 More than $1 million $500,000 - $1 million 32.5% Current 30.9% Current 30.8% 32.1% 30.5% 31.7% Senate bill 30.4% Senate bill 27.8%

Sabrina Tavernise,"Ben Shapiro, who has been called the voice of the conservative millennial movement, is trying to define conservatism at a time when its meaning is up for grabs.",2017-11-24T00:11:57Z,the-new-york-times,"Ben Shapiro, a Provocative ‘Gladiator,’ Battles to Win Young Conservatives",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/us/ben-shapiro-conservative.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/24/us/24shapiro1/00shapiro-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"But he is not a moderate. His views are extremely conservative: Transgenderism is a mental illness, as per the encyclopedia of mental disorders before 2013. Yes, blacks have been historically discriminated against. No, institutions are not broadly discriminating against them today. The rich pay too much tax. Abortion should be illegal. Social Security ought to be privatized and Obamacare repealed.

Liberals loathe Mr. Shapiro. They say he is a pugilist who has built his brand on the nation’s addiction to outrage. He is part of an industry that whips up conservatives against the left, they say, and the fact that his audience is mostly young will deepen the divide for years to come.

And even some former fans say Mr. Shapiro is a brilliant polemicist, but in a tribal nation, he’s just one more partisan mobilizing his troops.

“He’ll never concede anything to the left,” said William Nardi, a college student in Boston, who used to look up to Mr. Shapiro. “He’s saying the left is wrong and I’m right. Kids love that. All they care about is this feeling that they are right and that their identity is preserved. That’s what he gives them.”

Conservatives say he is a force for good. Liberals may not like his conclusions, but they are guiding young people at a time when the conservative movement is adrift and ideas of white nationalism are competing for their attention. Mr. Shapiro, an Orthodox Jew, was one of the first to call out the alt-right movement, denouncing it as racist and anti-Semitic at a time when most people saw it as counterculture and cool. He paid a price. He received 38 percent of all anti-Semitic tweets aimed at journalists in 2016, the largest single share, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

“There’s a real battle for hearts and minds going on right now and Ben is one of the main warriors,” said David French, a columnist for National Review. Mr. French calls Mr. Shapiro a “principled gladiator.” His aggressive tone draws in audiences, he said, but he does not attack unfairly, stoke anger for the sake of it, or mischaracterize his opponents’ positions. He even hits his own side, as he did with Sean Hannity for not weighing in on Roy S. Moore, the embattled Alabama Republican, and Mr. Bannon for supporting him.

“He appeals to the better angels of his audience’s nature, while still being a pugilist, and that’s quite a skill,” Mr. French said.

Mr. Shapiro grew up in Los Angeles in a Jewish family of Reagan Republicans. His parents both worked in Hollywood, his mother as an executive of a TV company and his father as a composer. They lived in a small house, his parents in one bedroom and he and his three sisters in the other. They had political discussions around the dinner table. He was patriotic. He dressed up as John Adams every year for Halloween from the age of 5. He had a favorite musical: 1776.

He is less established than Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, but his audience is younger. And instead of hunkering down in a studio, Mr. Shapiro travels the country, speaking at colleges (he’s been to 37 since early last year) and on panels.

“So often I’ve felt turning on Fox, it makes you dumber, but you listen to Ben Shapiro and you are likely to be both entertained and enlightened,” said Charlie Sykes, a conservative pundit and Trump critic. “He’s high octane. He reads books. His mind works really fast. He likes to get under people’s skin. He’s clearly part of this younger generation. I could imagine Bill Buckley looking down and smiling.”

People often discover Mr. Shapiro by seeing a video clip of him arguing with somebody. Some have been watched millions of times, like one from a college in Michigan in February. After a back and forth with a young woman in the audience about transgenderism, Mr. Shapiro asked her how old she was. She said 22.

“Why aren’t you 60?” he asked. “What is the problem with you identifying as 60?”

The young woman looked at him and hesitated, lowering the microphone slightly.

“It’s not the same as gender,” she said. “You can’t just …”

Mr. Shapiro looked at her, his face impassive: “You’re right,” he said. “You can’t magically change your gender. You can’t magically change your sex. You can’t magically change your age.”

In an age of partisan warfare on college campuses, this video clip is a rare weapon. It is also vintage Shapiro. He takes apart arguments in ways that makes the conservative conclusion seem utterly logical, like putting a key in a locked door. The clip has had about 47 million views on Facebook.

“There is a hunger in conservative millennial land for a different kind of voice,” Mr. French said. “They want someone who will unapologetically stand up for conservative values, but who is also articulating a movement they can feel proud of.”

Mr. Shapiro has always been deeply conservative and does not pretend to be objective. But he says his market niche is giving cleareyed reads of current events, not purely partisan rants. He is often compared to his former colleague at Breitbart, Milo Yiannopoulos. On the surface, they seem the same. Both speak on college campuses. Both draw protests. Both used to work for Mr. Bannon at Breitbart. Both are young.

In fact, they are very different. Mr. Yiannopoulos, a protégé of Mr. Bannon, was good at shocking audiences, saying things like “feminism is cancer.” But critics say that he was empty of ideas, a kind of nihilistic rodeo clown who was not even conservative. Mr. Shapiro broke with Mr. Bannon last year, saying Breitbart had become a propaganda tool for Mr. Trump.

Mr. Yiannopoulos’s act collapsed this year. But the fact that it lasted so long says a lot about the right’s fury against mainstream liberalism, Mr. Shapiro said.

Years of cultural dominance in TV, movies, comedy, media and to a large extent, universities, left conservatives feeling looked down on and labeled. Mr. Shapiro, who still lives in Los Angeles, wrote a book about it, “Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV.” Add to that economic frustration, and taboos around race, gender and sexual orientation, and you start to explain Mr. Limbaugh’s explosive success 20 years ago.

“Trump won the nomination because he was anti-left, not because of any political viewpoints,” Mr. Shapiro said in an interview. “He was slapping people on the left and people on the right went, ‘Yeah, those people need to be slapped!’”

But Mr. Shapiro does it too. He thinks it’s easy to provoke the left, which he says has become intellectually flabby after decades of cultural dominance. It’s not good at arguing and relies instead on taboos and punishing people who violate them. That is the essence of his stump speech.

“The left believes in a hierarchy of victimhood,” he said in Utah. “If you are L.G.B.T.Q., then we suggest that you are very top of the victimhood hierarchy. You have been most victimized in the United States and therefore your opinion must be taken with the most gravitas.”

He ticked off others.

“Black folks have been historically victimized in the United States, which of course, is true. But the idea that every black person now is being individually victimized by the United States is not true.”

Then he got to the group that made up most of the audience.

“Way down at the bottom are white straight males. Those are people whose opinions do not matter at all. Because those are the people who are the beneficiaries of the system. They don’t get to talk about the system because they were the ones who built the system.”

Critics say that is great red meat for his audience, but it’s nonsense. Even if straight white males are low on the left’s pecking order, they have most of the power in Washington, in statehouses, in every corporate boardroom. They run America.

Mr. Shapiro says he’s about more than tribal polemics. In an age of combative politics, you have to be a fighter to be in the game. And he says he’s willing to defend conservatism against those on the right as well as the left.

“I am trying to militantly defend conservative ideas,” he said. “I’m not going to be anti-left for the sake of it.”","breitbart milo yiannopoulos

Jason Zengerle,"For years, liberals have tried, and failed, to create their own version of conservative talk radio. Has Crooked Media finally figured it out?",2017-11-24T00:11:47Z,the-new-york-times,The Voices in Blue America’s Head,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/magazine/the-voices-in-blue-americas-head.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/26/magazine/26mag-media-image1/26mag-26media-t_CA0-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"“With Donald Trump winning the presidency, we have decided — we’ve realized — that democracy is not just a job for politicians,” Favreau told the crowd at Northam’s campaign office, amid half-empty doughnut boxes and carafes of coffee. “It’s a job for every single American, and that job doesn’t just end on Election Day — that job is an every-single-day job. It is a fight.”

As the podcasters spoke, Northam looked on with what appeared to be a mixture of bewilderment and admiration. He was the candidate, and the only person in the room wearing a suit and tie — the podcast hosts, like the canvassers, were dressed in jeans and hoodies — but it was clear he knew he wasn’t the star of this particular show. When it was his turn to speak, the man who in 36 hours would be elected Virginia’s 73rd governor recalled a conversation he had the day before with his two 20-something children. “They said, ‘We heard you’re going to be on “Pod Save America”! Is that true?’ ” Northam recounted. The crowd laughed. “Oh, my God!” he exclaimed. “I have finally arrived!”

During the 2016 campaign, Favreau, Lovett, Vietor and Pfeiffer — mostly as a lark — hosted a popular politics podcast for Bill Simmons’s sports-and-pop-culture website The Ringer called “Keepin’ It 1600.” But with Hillary Clinton expected to be sitting in the Oval Office in 2017, “we didn’t want to be the people who criticized the White House just to be interesting, nor did we want to be to the Clinton administration what Hannity now is to the Trump administration,” Pfeiffer says. “We all assumed the election was the end of the road for us.”

Favreau, Lovett and Vietor were in their 20s when they went to work for Obama in the White House, and they had been somewhat adrift since leaving it around the end of Obama’s first term. They relocated to California in search of a second act, but nothing quite stuck. Lovett helped create a sitcom called “1600 Penn” about a wacky First Family, but poor ratings and reviews led NBC to cancel it after one season. Favreau and Vietor founded a strategic communications firm to pay the bills while they nursed their own TV ambitions, but their projects — a campaign drama-comedy called “Early States” and a public-affairs show that they pitched, with Lovett, as “a millennial ‘Meet the Press’ ” — were rejected by the networks and streaming services. “Lots of people in suits told us that politics was a crowded space as they greenlit ‘CSI [expletive] West Hollywood’ or whatever,” Vietor recalls.

The day after Trump’s victory, Lovett was driving Favreau and Vietor to The Ringer’s Hollywood studios when his car ran out of gas. It was while the three of them were pushing the Jeep Grand Cherokee down Sunset Boulevard that they first started discussing what would become “Pod Save America” and Crooked Media. They wanted to get involved in politics again, but none of them had any desire to go back to Washington or to work for a candidate. A podcast and a liberal media company, they thought, could be their contribution to the anti-Trump resistance.

In the early days of “Pod Save America,” the hosts leaned heavily on their Obama connections; Obama himself was the guest on one of their first episodes. But as the podcast rapidly built an audience, Democratic politicians outside the Obama orbit began accepting their invitations, or sometimes even asking to appear on the show — even if they didn’t always know what exactly “Pod Save America” was. In a May episode, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota confessed that it had been her daughter’s idea for her to be interviewed: “I, for some reason, thought it was a video, so I spent a lot of time wearing a hip outfit today, and then I found out it was a podcast.”

More than 1,600 political podcasts — most of them anti-Trump — have appeared since the 2016 election, according to RawVoice, a podcast hosting and analytics company. “Pod Save America,” with nearly 120 million downloads to date, is the undisputed king of the field. But the show’s numbers alone do not quite capture the nature of its accomplishment. With a shoestring budget and no organizational backing, its hosts seem to have created something that liberals have spent almost two decades, and hundreds of millions of dollars, futilely searching for: the left’s answer to conservative talk radio.

Air America, the nationwide liberal talk-radio network, declared bankruptcy and stopped broadcasting in 2010 after six years of middling to abysmal ratings. The independent cable network Current TV, which Al Gore started with Joel Hyatt in 2005, tried to make itself a platform for unapologetically liberal commentary — at one point hiring Keith Olbermann as its chief news officer — but it was sold and shut down in 2013. Part of the problem with these earlier ventures was their arms-race mentality: They offered liberals a mirror image of what conservatives had, rather than something liberals might actually want. “Olbermann was lefty O’Reilly,” says Tim Miller, a Republican media consultant and Crooked Media’s token conservative contributor. “Air America was lefty Limbaugh.”

“Pod Save America,” by contrast, has no conservative antecedent. The craft-beer-bar-bull-session vibe of podcasts suits the left better than the shouty antagonism of talk radio. “Rather than trying to replicate what’s worked on the right, these podcasts aren’t taking the same tropes you see on Fox or hear on conservative talk radio and applying them to the left,” Miller says.

On “Pod Save America,” Favreau sits in what radio pros call “the power chair,” dictating the topics and pace of the show; Lovett provides comic relief; and Pfeiffer and Vietor contribute an earnest wonkiness. A typical hourlong episode might consist of a breakdown of the latest Republican tax-reform proposal, some war stories from the Obama White House, a dispute about which host was more disruptive at a recent “Game of Thrones” viewing party and an interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates. “It’s down to earth and relaxed,” Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts congressman who appeared on “Pod Save America” in March, told me. “I think it’s important for people to realize I’m a regular person, and sometimes you don’t get that when you see me in a suit on CNN.”

Like conservative talk radio or Fox News, “Pod Save America” is an authentic partisan response to the perceived failings of the mainstream media. While many conservatives hate the mainstream media for its supposed liberal bias, many liberals have come to despise what they see as its tendency toward false equivalence — a grievance particularly inflamed by the coverage of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Liberals don’t want a hermetically sealed media ecosystem of their own, so much as one that does away with the pretense of kneejerk balance: a media that’s willing to say one side is worse than the other. “I screamed at the TV a lot in the White House,” Favreau says. He and his co-hosts particularly loathe the bipartisan on-air panels of blabbering pundits that cable networks deployed during the election. “If there is one way that I would sum up what the 2016 election was on cable news,” Lovett says, “it was world-class journalists interviewing morons.”

“Pod Save America,” to its hosts and its listeners, is a twice-weekly reality check. “I think that when you have a president gaslighting an entire nation,” Vietor says, “there’s a cathartic effect when you have a couple of people who worked in the White House who are like: ‘Hey, this is crazy. You’re right, he’s wrong.’ ”

What is absent from the podcast, significantly, is any of the usual liberal squeamishness (or, depending on your point of view, principle) about using media as a tool of partisan advantage. Liberal activists point regretfully to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who in their Comedy Central heyday were happy to savage Republicans but refused to champion Democrats: In 2010, the pair drew some 215,000 people to the National Mall a few days before the midterm elections, only to keep the rally strictly nonpartisan. “Pod Save America,” by contrast, isn’t afraid to, as Ben Wikler of MoveOn puts it, “actually touch Excalibur.” At the theater in Richmond this month, shortly before bringing Northam and the rest of Virginia’s Democratic ticket onstage, Favreau asked the crowd: “Is everyone registered to vote? Is everyone going to be doing phone-banking and canvassing? Because if not, you have to leave.”

Crooked Media’s headquarters consists of a few bargain-priced rooms on La Cienega in a seedy section of West Hollywood, cater-corner to a lingerie shop and across the street from a strip club. On the summer afternoon I visited, I was greeted at the entrance by a goldendoodle. Favreau, materializing behind the animal, said: “This is Lovett’s dog, Pundit — the thing that we hate and the thing that we’ve become.”

The office, like the company itself, was still very much a work in progress. An entire wall was covered with “A Beautiful Mind”-style scribbles about “webseries,” “daily micropods” and “chat convos” — the handiwork of Tanya Somanader, who was the director of digital rapid response in the Obama White House and is now Crooked Media’s chief content officer. “This,” she said, pointing at the wall and summoning as portentous a tone as she could muster, “is how you build a media empire.”

The self-mockery about Crooked Media’s ambitions belies how outsize those ambitions are. In addition to “Pod Save America,” the company now has six other podcasts and plans to roll out at least two more soon. It has hired two producers, one from MTV and the other from the Oprah Winfrey Network. In October, it poached a New Republic writer to helm its website. A nationwide “Pod Save America” tour, Crooked Media’s first serious stab at live events, has so far played to sold-out theaters in seven cities. For the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential race, Crooked Media is hoping to host candidate forums and debates.

Acutely aware of the perils of their new operation resembling the old political-media boys’ club, the decidedly bro-ish “Pod Save America” hosts have slanted Crooked Media’s growing podcast slate toward non-white-male hosts, and the company’s top two executives are women. “Ideally what we’re trying to build is a media company that’s not about one show, ‘Pod Save America,’ but a whole bunch of new shows that are not living and dying by the latest tweet,” Vietor told me.

Still, the one show is serving them awfully well. An executive at another podcasting company told me that assuming standard industry rates, Crooked Media is most likely bringing in at least $50,000 in advertising revenue for each episode of “Pod Save America” — which at two episodes a week is about $5 million a year. That has allowed the company to turn away the many investors who have approached it. Peter Chernin, whose Chernin Group acquired a reported 51 percent stake in the media company Barstool Sports last year, was one of them. “I think it’s more unusual than standard to turn down investors,” Chernin told me, “but it’s been very smart on their part.”

Chernin was the president of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation when the company enlisted Roger Ailes to get Fox News off the ground in the late 1990s, and he sees some parallels between the conservative cable channel and Crooked Media. “This was true of Roger: It’s not just a business for these Crooked Media guys, it’s a calling,” he told me. “The real execution challenge is about authenticity. Does it feel authentic to the audience? They certainly have that going for them.”

Few things are as inauthenticity-prone, however, as the political-pundit business. On a Saturday morning in July, “Pod Save America” traveled to the Pasadena Convention Center for Politicon, a two-day event that has been hailed as the “Comic-Con of politics,” in which several thousand political junkies pay $80 apiece for the opportunity to see their favorite cable-news talking heads in the flesh. When the Politicon organizers first approached them about appearing, the “Pod Save America” hosts recoiled at the idea — “Some of these people are despicable,” Lovett complained to the organizers about the other invitees — but they eventually reconsidered. After all, they had a brand to promote.

As they stood at the threshold of the Politicon greenroom, the “Pod Save America” hosts looked like patients about to go into surgery. “I’d rather stay out here as long as possible,” Vietor whispered. Inside, Ann Coulter — flanked by a couple of cops who were providing security — marked her territory, while the Coulter wannabe Tomi Lahren paraded around with a camera crew in tow. In one corner, the Republican rogue Roger Stone held court. In another, Chris Cillizza of CNN dispensed conventional wisdom. The Crooked Media guys mostly talked among themselves.

Then Vietor and Lovett spotted Bill Kristol, the founding editor of The Weekly Standard and a neoconservative boogeyman to liberals during the George W. Bush presidency, who emerged as one of the most forthright conservative critics of Trump in 2016. They introduced themselves and fell into conversation about the 2008 election. “You guys had a good team,” Kristol said. “It seems like another era: Hillary and Obama debating the intricacies of whether you could do health care reform without a mandate or with a mandate.”

“The primary was about whether the I.R.G.C.” — Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — “should be a terrorist group!” Vietor marveled.

Soon, their discussion turned to the Trump administration. “It’s so unbelievable that these guys are trying to run anything,” Kristol lamented. “This level of total insanity is terrible.”

“You know what?” Lovett told Kristol. “I like you better lately. It’s like we’re together to fight the aliens.”

“It’s like we’re all defending the Earth!” Kristol said.

“But at some point the aliens will leave,” Lovett reminded him. “And then we’ll just be sitting at the same table being like, ‘Oh, right, we hate each other.’ ”","islamic revolutionary guard corps

Carl Hulse,Elements that foreshadowed steep losses for Democrats eight years ago are in place for Republicans today.,2017-11-23T14:55:13Z,the-new-york-times,Blast From the Past: The Current Political World Mirrors 2009,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/us/politics/democrats-republicans-washington.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/23/us/23dc-hulse1/23dc-hulse1-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Republicans sensed eight years ago that Democrats were well on their way to political disaster. And in Massachusetts, they were seeing convincing evidence of a sea change in the political world.

Mr. Brown, a Republican state senator at the time, was showing real strength in the race to replace Senator Edward M. Kennedy, whose seat was left vacant after his death in August 2009. Democrats could not quite fathom the possibility that a Republican could win in liberal Massachusetts and succeed Mr. Kennedy, the party’s longtime leader on health policy, at such a crucial point in the health care fight.

But Republicans were quickly persuaded.

“That was when it really, really hit me that things were changing,” said Rob Jesmer, a top Republican strategist who was running the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Mr. Brown went on in early January to beat Martha M. Coakley, the Democratic state attorney general who backed the Obama agenda and made several costly political missteps.

This year it is Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in deeply conservative Alabama, who is in trouble in a race that should be a gimme in such a state. Multiple accusations against Mr. Moore of sexual abuse and pursuit of teenage girls while an adult have opened the door to the previously unthinkable idea that Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, could claim the seat on Dec. 12. That outcome would cut the Republican majority to 51, give Democrats a real chance to compete for Senate control next year and make it tougher to pass the tax bill this year.

While Senate Republicans hope to pass their version of the tax bill as early as next week, it would still have to be reconciled with the House plan. If Mr. Jones wins, Republicans could then afford to lose only one vote if he were seated before any final approval. Multiple Republicans remain uncommitted on the tax plan.

It is quite reminiscent of what happened when Mr. Brown’s election in January 2010 upended Democratic plans for the health care bill, which had passed the Senate on Christmas Eve. The victory by Mr. Brown, who campaigned against the health care law, deprived Democrats of the crucial 60th vote to break a filibuster. As a result, the House had to ultimately accept the Senate version of the law, preventing Democrats from making changes that would have avoided some of the problems that later dogged the legislation.

Democrats say the tax bill being pushed by Republicans desperate for their first big legislative accomplishment could blow up on them just as the health care bill cost Democrats.

“They think this is their salvation, but it is most likely their Alamo,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland.

Mr. Van Hollen has experience with political backlash: He was the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee when his party lost 63 seats and control of the House in 2010. Now he is the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, at a time when Republicans are back on their heels.

Mr. Van Hollen said one difference he saw between the two election cycles was that Republicans suffered deeper losses up and down the ballot in off-year elections this month than Democrats did in 2009.

“We knew we were facing a big headwind, but it wasn’t clear how big it was going to be,” Mr. Van Hollen said. He said Republicans now confronted a “killer political wave.”

“The only question is whether it is going to grow bigger or shrink between now and November 2018,” he said.

Despite warnings of a possible political calamity if they passed the health care law, Democrats plunged ahead and paid the price.

Mr. Jesmer said that despite political risks posed by the tax bill, which had not polled well and aimed most of its benefits at the business community rather than at middle-class earners, Republicans had little choice but to persevere.

“I don’t fault us for doing what we are trying to do,” he said. “The out-party is always going to have the advantage in the midterms, so you might as well ram through what you want to ram through.”

Republicans do not think the tax bill will be a political albatross once voters gain a fuller appreciation of its advantages. Of course, that is exactly what Democrats thought about the health care bill at this point in 2009.","democratic senatorial campaign committee

Daniel Politi and Ernesto Londoño,"The disclosure raised fears that the 44-member crew had been lost, but the navy said a search for the vessel would continue.",2017-11-23T17:03:17Z,the-new-york-times,Explosion Was Recorded Where Argentine Submarine Went Missing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/world/americas/argentina-submarine-explosion.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/24/world/24argentina/24argentina-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"While the Navy did not formally give up hope of finding the crew, relatives began referring to their loved ones in the past tense. If the sailors perished, it would be the deadliest submarine catastrophe since the sinking of the Kursk — a Russian vessel brought down by a misfired weapon in 2000 — and the Argentine military’s largest loss of life since the Falklands War of 1982.

The disappearance and likely loss of the vessel, the San Juan, could turn out to be the greatest national tragedy to unfold under President Mauricio Macri, who came into office nearly two years ago vowing to invest in Argentina’s underfunded armed forces.

Even before the latest news, frustration at Mr. Macri had been mounting.

“Instead of spending on other matters, why don’t you spend on something truly important, like the life of all our relatives,” an unidentified woman asked Mr. Macri on Monday when he traveled to the resort city of Mar del Plata, according to a video of the meeting that was posted online.

Using submarines that have been in commission since the early 1980s “is taking a gamble on the life of our people,” she said.

Argentina has spent less than several of its neighbors on defense since the end of military rule in 1983. Despite Mr. Macri’s promises, the effort to repair and replace the country’s aging planes and ships is in a nascent phase.

Last year, Argentina spent about 1 percent of its gross domestic product on the military, lagging behind neighbors like Chile, which spent 1.9 percent, and Brazil, which spent 1.3 percent, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

“Argentina’s armed forces began to atrophy after the end of the military rule,” said Dan Wasserbly, the Americas editor of IHS Jane’s, a defense-industry publication. “It’s been a pretty long-running trend where they have talked about investing, adding resources and building up the readiness of a once-formidable military, but they haven’t been able to do that.”

The San Juan, a German-made diesel-electric vessel, was built in 1983 and first put into commission in 1985. It was put back into service in 2014 after a retrofit, and had been scheduled to return on Sunday to its home base at Mar del Plata, about 250 miles south of Buenos Aires.

Even as a multinational search effort combed the seas last weekend, braving stormy weather and 22-foot waves, analysts at the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna began considering whether the steady stream of information from monitors that track sound and earth movements across the world may have picked up clues about the missing vessel.

The organization, which is usually focused on picking up signs of nuclear tests, undertook the analysis on its own initiative.

Mario Zampolli, a hydroacoustic engineer at the organization, said he and his colleagues began poring over data from the two nearest sensors to the search area over the weekend. Picking up evidence of a relatively small explosion in the ocean requires manual analysis of data and custom-designed software, Mr. Zampolli said in an interview.

“We try to determine that it doesn’t come from a natural event such as volcanic activities, whales or an earthquake,” he said. The organization shared its findings with the Argentine ambassador in Vienna on Thursday, after concluding that it was “similar to other water explosions observed previously.”

That finding was broadly in line with an assessment the United States shared with Argentina on Tuesday night.

Cmdr. Erik Reynolds, a spokesman for the United States Navy, said American analysts had ascertained that a sound registered in the ocean off the coast of Patagonia was a “hydroacoustic anomaly” that had not been caused by natural events.

“That was not a natural sound you hear in an ocean environment,” he said.

After piecing the two assessments together, and finding that they both pointed to an explosion in the area where the submarine was known to have been, Argentine military officials decided to break the news to relatives. Minutes later, a forlorn-looking navy spokesman, Capt. Enrique Balbi, addressed reporters.

Captain Balbi said there was no evidence that a battery malfunction, which the captain of the San Juan reported shortly before the submarine went silent on Nov. 15, was related to the explosion. The Argentine Navy disclosed the battery problems, which it characterized as a routine mishap, on Monday.

That piece of sobering news soured the mood here after a weekend that had seemed more hopeful. On Saturday, Argentina’s defense minister said there were records of satellite phone calls placed from the submarine that day, suggesting the crew was alive. The following day, however, with little explanation, the Navy had to acknowledge that no such calls were tracked.

Argentine and outside experts have said that even if the San Juan was intact, its crew would probably have only enough oxygen to survive seven to 10 days.

On Thursday, as a sunny morning gave way to a chilly, cloudy afternoon, about 25 people gathered outside the fence of the naval base to pray a rosary. A few friends and relatives of crew members said they were still holding on to a glimmer of hope. But for most, grief was starting to take hold.

“He was my first love,” said Jesica Gopar, the wife of a crew member, Fernando Santilli. “If he can somehow hear me out there, all I can say is I love him and that his son will have a bright future because we have many people who are helping us.”

Ms. Gopar said she had largely stayed away from the base in recent days. But on Thursday she woke up “with the feeling that something had happened.” So she drew up a sign to honor Mr. Santilli and his comrades and headed to the base to add it to the messages of hope and flags pinned up on the outer fence.

“I came to put up a sign, only to find out I am a widow,” Ms. Gopar said.","germanmade dieselelectric

HONG KONG — The United States Navy on Friday ended its search for three sailors who have been missing since a transport plane crashed near Japan this week, the Navy’s Seventh Fleet said in a statement.

Eight of the 11 passengers and crew members who were aboard the C2-A Greyhound propeller cargo plane were rescued after the crash Wednesday. The Seventh Fleet said they remained in good condition.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with our lost shipmates and their families,” Rear Adm. Marc Dalton said in the statement. “As difficult as this is, we are thankful for the rapid and effective response that led to the rescue of eight of our shipmates, and I appreciate the professionalism and dedication shown by all who participated in the search efforts.”

The crash was the fifth accident this year for the fleet, which has its headquarters in Japan and is the Navy’s largest fleet overseas. The accidents, including a pair of deadly collisions, led the Navy to relieve the head of the Seventh Fleet of his command in August.

The plane crashed in the Philippine Sea about 500 nautical miles southeast of Okinawa around 2:45 p.m. Wednesday while en route to the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan, the Seventh Fleet said. The C2-A Greyhound is a model that has been in use for decades to ferry personnel and supplies to and from aircraft carriers at sea.","united states navy

Sui-Lee Wee,The police detained seven people thought to have helped thousands of Chinese circumvent government limits on how much money they can move from the country.,2017-11-24T01:10:33Z,the-new-york-times,China Busts a $3 Billion Underground Bank as It Tightens Its Grip on Money,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/business/china-underground-bank-3-billion.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/24/world/24chinamoney-1/24chinamoney-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The Chinese police have detained seven people believed to be involved in the bank, according to the Thursday reports. The authorities discovered 148 “illegal and fraudulent accounts” from the bank, involving more than 10,000 people, the Xinhua report said.

Underground banks are illegal but common in China. According to China’s Ministry of Public Security, underground banks handled more than $137 billion in transactions last year. There are also lawful ways of moving princely sums out of China without surpassing government limits: directing money to casinos in Macau — the only Chinese territory where gambling is legal — as well as using credit cards to buy luxury goods abroad and purchasing insurance policies that can be cashed out overseas.

China imposes strict limits on how much money can leave the country. Those limits help the government keep a firm hand on the value of its currency, and the Chinese authorities credit the limits with helping keep its financial system steady during emergencies like the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the global crisis that began in 2008.

The government sets a $50,000 limit on the money Chinese citizens can move out of the country in a year, though businesses and those making strategic investments can send out much more.

But growing numbers of people began dodging the limits two years ago, when a stock market crash, a surprise government-led currency devaluation and prospects of slowing economic growth led many to seek safer havens for their money.

President Xi Jinping has made it a top priority to keep more money in China. His government has shut down platforms that trade cryptocurrencies; announced controls on outbound investment in property, entertainment and soccer; and imposed curbs on payments overseas.

Much of China’s underground banking activity is centered in cities that border Hong Kong and Macau, special administrative regions of China that are governed by their own laws.

In Shaoguan, the police were alerted to a suspicious bank account that was opened in 2011 in the city by a Mr. Zhong, a resident from the southern city of Zhuhai that borders Macau, according to Guangzhou Daily, an official newspaper. It did not further identify Mr. Zhong. After almost no activity for years, there were 121 transactions involving $15 million in 2016, prompting the authorities to look more closely at who was involved.

Ultimately, the Xinhua report said, the authorities discovered that the people running the underground bank had illegally bought and stole the identity documents of more than 200 people to open the fake accounts that underpinned the enterprise. News reports did not disclose detailed information about how the underground bank worked.

The Shaoguan government and the police did not respond to requests for comment.

The trail appeared to lead to Macau, according to the news reports. The suspicious bank account that prompted the investigation was opened specifically for a gambler in Macau called Mr. Peng to transfer money, Xinhua said. “Several members of the criminal gang” then converted the renminbi into Hong Kong dollars for Mr. Peng, according to the report. Hong Kong has its own currency, which tracks the value of the United States dollar.

The Xinhua report did not offer details about Mr. Peng.

Macau is under pressure to keep a tight rein on capital outflows. Most recently, it installed automated teller machines with facial recognition software to monitor transactions for people using Chinese bank cards, according to Macau Daily Times.

The Xinhua report acknowledged that underground banks are “seductive,” especially for people who struggle to get financing, but warned that “the people will suffer tremendous loss” if the banks abscond or cheat their clients.","view all new york times

Trond Vidar Bjorøy,While Bitcoin currently bears more resemblance to digital gold than digital cash -- with its congested pending transactions log rendering it practically useless as a currency since ...,2017-11-23T16:41:14Z,the-next-web,The current state of Bitcoin and Ethereum,https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/11/23/current-state-bitcoin-ethereum/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/11/bithereum-part-34756345987347-social.png,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"While Bitcoin currently bears more resemblance to digital gold than digital cash — with its congested pending transactions log rendering it practically useless as a currency since the cancelled fork two weeks ago — the Ethereum network is looking healthier than ever and in a good position to come out of the ongoing currency war successful.

Bitcoin has been dominating both crypto and mainstream news lately, even more so than usual, with mad volatility due to its continuous fork drama and rumours of free money for anyone holding it. Bitcoin breaking new all-time highs almost on a daily basis certainly doesn’t do anything to decrease the attention.

With this one-sided media coverage, it’s no wonder no one outside the small crypto community knows that Ethereum is regularly handling around twice the daily transactions of Bitcoin, and more than most other leading cryptos combined, that Ethereum’s transfers are extremely fast compared to Bitcoin’s, or that its median transaction fees are nearly 59 times cheaper.

Some Bitcoin maximalists are calling the high transaction fees a feature. Some also say that the fact that BTC collects $1.5 million a day in fees, against ETH’s measly $200,000, is a clear indicator of real world value as it shows that people are willing to spend more money to get onto the BTC blockchain.

However, there is a difference in being willing to spend more money and being forced to. Lately, Bitcoin has lived up to its name as a great store of value, although not for the right reasons. Since the cancellation of Segwit2x, people have simply been unable to move their funds in or out. With a ridiculous number of transactions constantly waiting to be mined, you better be prepared to pay up if you want to get your transaction through in reasonable time.

In its current state, Bitcoin isn’t much more than a speculation vehicle, something to be bought and sold on exchanges (whose trades happen off-chain and therefore aren’t affected by the long confirmation times). Few people need to use it. There aren’t many companies building on it. It’s not even useable as payment anymore. But maybe it doesn’t have to be either. Maybe we should be looking at Bitcoin and other coins and tokens as an entirely new asset class, something we don’t fully understand the implications of yet.

While there are many other blockchains claiming to be able to supersede Ethereum on all of the above areas, with EOS being most vocal about it, personally I’m a bit tired of hearing about what all the projects out there could revolutionize some day.

The discussion should no longer just be about which blockchain can handle more transactions faster and cheaper, but also about which one is actually seeing the numbers required to prove its capabilities right now. There’s currently no other project competing with Ethereum when it comes to the sheer number of use cases, and developers and companies building cool stuff on top of it. Some of these teams will be building the new backend of the internet, nothing less.

After months of poking ETH with a stick it’s finally showing signs of life again.

If Metcalfe’s law and the high activity levels on the Ethereum platform can be used as any reference, the Ether price is currently heavily suppressed. Over the past week it has finally started to see some upwards movement though, moving from the safe haven that has been $300 for so long now, and just passed $400 at the time of writing.

Over the last few months, investors speculators have found comfort in the fact that price stability, consolidation, and steady long term gains are usually signs of strong fundamentals, however the past few days have regained confidence in the platform, bringing back the optimism from Ether’s last bull run back in May.

Considering that public Ethereum doesn’t have any major dapps live yet, it’s going to be interesting to see how the network scales with the increase in transactions that will come as more and more applications launch in 2018 — especially if traffic really starts picking up before Casper and other scaling measures get implemented. Right now though, the beloved and hated ICO is still arguably Ethereum’s killer app and ETH’s value is, just like BTC’s, purely a speculative one.

Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.

But a new feature, which is buried deeply within the site, takes a different tack and introduces a new “Mention a friend” button to comments. Clicking this brings up your friends list, which you can scroll through. Tags appear wherever your cursor is, or at the end of the post.

I can imagine this being handy if you need to tag someone in a comment — but their name momentarily escapes you. This happens to me all the time. Otherwise, I can’t think of an advantage over just typing someone’s name.

It’s also worth pointing out that something similar is already available when composing posts and statuses.

At the moment, it can only be found by doing some pretty heavy tweaking to the site’s code. It’s obvious Facebook didn’t want anyone to find it out. It’s not immediately apparent if the social networking site plans to introduce this at a later date, or if this is just a remnant of an earlier test that Facebook forgot to remove.

We’ve reached out to Facebook for more information, and if we hear back from them, we’ll update this post.

Mix,Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency experiencing a healthy increase in price: Ethereum has surged past the $400 mark to hit an all-time high of $414.,2017-11-23T16:13:51Z,the-next-web,Ethereum breaks the $400 barrier to hit an all-time high,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2017/11/23/ethereum-400-usd-high/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/11/ethereum-1.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency experiencing a healthy increase in price these days: Ethereum has suddenly surged past the $400 mark to hit an all-time high price value.

After months of fluctuating at around $320, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market share managed to surpass the $400 threshold to set a record high price of $414 (at the time of writing), according to data from EthereumPrice.

For context, this amounts to a little more than a 13-percent jump in price over the last 24 hours. Check out this graph for more details:

In addition to its new all-time high price, Ethereum now boasts a market cap of nearly $40 billion, coming second only to Bitcoin’s $137 billion market share.

While the price of Bitcoin is about 20 times higher than Ether, one department where Ethereum still has a massive edge is in the efficiency of its blockchain. Ethereum currently processes about twice as many transactions as Bitcoin every day; and does so at significantly lower costs, between five and six times lower to be exact.

What is particularly interesting about Ethereum’s price hike is that it happens only two weeks after a critical vulnerability in the Parity wallet left hundreds of users without access to their Ether. According to estimates, the total amount of frozen funds is between $150 and $300 million worth of Ether.

But being roboticists, they started looking for a mechanical solution to their problem. So instead of going for medication that can lead to addiction, Jagtenberg and his team developed Somnox, a soft, cuddly robot built to help people fall asleep.

The robot is peanut-shaped and features a secret mechanism that’s supposed to simulate the expansion and contraction of breath in the robot. According to its creators, people who hold the robot up against their body soon fall into the same soothing breathing rythm of the robot, which should help them relax and fall asleep. Apparently, their invention garnered so many positive responses, that they decided to turn their university project into a company.

After developing the product for a few years, the team is now confident enough in their product to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund production costs. Watch our video above to find out if it worked.

Some users have reported seeing a new icon, ‘Find Players,’ in the area used to compose statuses and posts. From what we can tell, this is relatively bare-bones. The things you’d expect from such a feature — like integration with PSN, Steam, or Xbox Live — aren’t present. Instead, you’re prompted to give your team a name, a description, a hashtag, and optionally, a photo.

The biggest advantage for this is that it could allow individuals to organize team games for titles that don’t necessarily have a fleshed-out multiplayer component. The first game that comes to mind is Pokemon Go, where you can take part in Raid Battles, but the exploration and catching aspect of the game isn’t quite as collaborative. In this instance, I can imagine someone using the “Find Players” feature to tell their friends that they’ve put down a lure, for example.

I can also see this being used to organise card and tabletop games — like Dungeons and Dragons and Magic: The Gathering.

According to TNW’s Head of Social, Matt Navarra, small-scale trials of this feature have been around as early as October. Currently, Facebook is testing it on groups that are centred around videogames. Navarra was able to access the feature by creating such a group.

We’ve reached out to Facebook for more information. If we hear back from them, we’ll update this post.

New research indicates that the popular cryptocurrency now consumes more electricity than more than 20 countries in Europe.

Researchers from British energy price comparison platform Power Compare have discovered that the total volume of electricity required for mining Bitcoin – the computational process that keeps transactions on the blockchain moving – now amounts to more consumption than 159 individual countries.

Among others, the list includes Ireland, Croatia, Serbia, Slovakia and Iceland.

Interestingly, only three countries out of the entire continent of Africa currently consume more electricity than Bitcoin: South Africa, Egypt and Algeria.

As far as the rest of the world goes, Power Compare mentions Ecuador, Puerto Rico, North Korea and many more.

Check out this graphic for a more detailed breakdown:

Power Compare further notes that Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at 29.05 TWh – the equivalent of 0.13 percent of the world’s overall electricity needs.

This means that, if Bitcoin miners were to found their own autonomous state, it would rank 61st globally in terms of total electricity consumption. That ought to give you a better idea why Bitcoin’s mining community played such a crucial part in the dreadful Segwit2X discussions.

According to Power Compare, Bitcoin mining has seen a nearly 30 percent increase in consumption over the last 30 days alone.

Curiously, the research points out that, assuming Bitcoin’s electricity needs continue growing at this rate, the global mining consumption could be greater than the UK’s entire electricity supply by October next year.

In case you were wondering what all this electricity bills round up to, the researchers estimate the annual Bitcoin mining electricity costs currently stand at $1.5 billion. One thing to keep in mind is that the estimation assumes mining occurs in places with low electricity rates. So the number could be even higher in reality.

We asked three entrepreneurs in TQ, a tech hub in the heart of Amsterdam, who have experienced this first-hand, what their advice is if you are to engage in such an adventure.

Combine your personal purpose with a skill

Thomas Moes, co-founder of Homerun:

I started my career at a design agency teaching me the basics of being a designer and how business works. In the evening hours two friends and I started an online design magazine named FONTANEL, basically to satisfy our creative curiosity. Even though we didn’t earn a penny in the first couple of years we did manage to interview our heroes, experiment with the possibilities of the internet, grow our network, sharpen our design critique, and enable talented designers to find great new jobs.

My top tip would be to find what your personal purpose is — what you find meaningful and what intrinsically motivates you — and combine that with the mastery of a business skill. I’ve found people usually do their best work if they combine the two. My personal purpose has always been to help people become happier through work and I’ve managed to combine that with my love for digital design by co-founding recruiting platform Homerun.

Be organized and communicate well

Frederick Gentis, founder of Gallerease:

I started my business next to having a full-time job in fixed income. When you have a family to provide for and a mortgage to pay, it’s easy to choose the certainty of a good employer over the uncertainty of running your own business with all the risk and responsibilities that come with it.

For me it’s key to organize my thoughts, agenda, and businesses. When you do two jobs and want to keep everyone happy you need to be organized. Meetings will often be scheduled on the same day and time. Having to cancel a meeting because you forgot a more important one will cause frustration on all sides.

No matter how organized you might be, if you don’t communicate to others it will create tension. I had to manage my clients, my colleagues, my employer, my investors, my employees, and my family. And of course I miscommunicated my agenda and thoughts and even forgot to communicate at all… more than once. That perhaps was the hardest lesson of all. You can have it all planned but if you don’t communicate your plans will fail, and you’ll lose both goodwill and credibility.

Focus on what you’re good at and outsource the rest

Jules van Bruggen, founder of Sitly:

Balancing my full-time job while founding my startup basically meant that after a day’s work at my job, and after our newborn baby got to sleep, I opened my laptop and started to work on my startup. I outsourced the web development to a small agency I knew and trusted via my network. I paid them with my holiday pay and bonus.

I did this for two years in the evenings and weekends. When I noticed that the platform was used by a couple of thousands of users and in fact solved a problem parents experienced in finding affordable childcare, I decided to quit my job in order to scale the platform. My working days were quite long but it didn’t feel like hard work because I really believed in what I was solving and I felt very passionate about it.

I’d recommend only focussing your time on the things that you’re good at and to make sure to outsource the activities others can do better. Also ensure you have a budget to develop and market the product, because without marketing your product will never fly.

Meanwhile, don’t forget to educate yourself. For instance, I didn’t know anything about SEO, Adwords, and social media marketing. So I attended trainings, meet-ups and watched many online tutorials. This allowed me to generate traffic and conversion without having to spend thousands of euros on consultancy. And finally, start with a business model from the beginning. Every hundred euro I earned, I invested back into marketing which allowed me to organically grow the company.

It’s called Collections, and it’s similar to the Instagram feature of the same name that launched in April: in addition to saving posts from your feed to an ever-expanding list you can retrieve later, you’ll now be able to organize these into folders for easy retrieval.

Credit: Mari Smith

The update was first spotted by social media professional Mari Smith; from her screenshots, it appears to work in a similar fashion to Instagram’s Collections. When you choose to save a post from the three-dots menu, you’ll see an on-screen prompt to organize it into a Collection. You’ll also be able to create and view Collections in the Saved items list.

That’ll certainly come in handy for folks who like to read posts and watch videos later. I spot a fair bit of fun and informative content in my feed, and have plenty of items stashed away for later – but it’s easier to go through them when they’re neatly arranged in folders that I can approach depending on what I’m interested in or have time for at that moment – like long reads, funny videos, and new music.

It might also be useful for those who interact with plenty of groups, and shop through the social network. Facebook also has a browser extension that lets you save pages from anywhere on the web to return to later, so the ability to categorize all these items will no doubt be appreciated by fans of the tool.

The Collections feature seems to only be available for a small number of users at present; it isn’t clear if it’s fully ready for prime-time yet, or when Facebook will roll it out to more people.

We’ve contacted the company to learn more and will update this post if there’s a response.

Jessica Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn, who are two of the five commissioners at the FCC and have been serving there for years now, have come out in support of preserving net neutrality.

Credit: Wikimedia Commons

Rosenworcel published an article on Slate this week, urging citizens to contact the FCC and voice their opinion, and has been calling on the agency to hold public hearings before going ahead with decisions on things like repealing consumer protections.

This is the @FCC plan to roll back #NetNeutrality: https://t.co/05owAva2hu. Don't boo. Read it. Then roar. It's time to make a ruckus. It's time to #SaveNetNeutrality. — Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) November 22, 2017

Clyburn, who’s been with the FCC since 2009, is also keen on keeping the internet free of fast and slow lanes nationwide. She posted a two-page fact sheet that unpacks chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to undo net neutrality yesterday, which you can read over on the FCC’s site (PDF).

.@FCC Majority’s “Pre-Holiday News Dump” would dismantle #netneutrality. This most unwelcome #ThanksgivingFail is simply a giveaway to the nation’s largest communications companies at the expense of #consumers & #innovation. My statement: https://t.co/EY9eNmP9jx — Mignon Clyburn (@MClyburnFCC) November 21, 2017

That leaves three FCC commissioners – Pai included – who must be convinced to rethink the upcoming proposal that will dash net neutrality across the US. Or rather, just one needs to be convinced, so as to win the vote 3-2, in order to preserve the guidelines as they are.

So what can you do to help? The agency has stopped collecting comments from the public on this issue, but you can write or call Congress to apply pressure on the FCC to rethink its plans.

Additionally, you can attend demonstrations at Verizon retail stores across the country to show your support on December 7. The telecom giant was chosen as a target because Pai was a former lawyer for the company. This page displays a map of planned protests, and also includes information on how you can host one near you.

Time is of the essence, folks.

It did this just days before a major national holiday in the United States, and is giving the public just three weeks to react before the rollback will be voted on. But that timing hasn’t stifled the early response.

To start, BattleForTheNet.com, a virtual meeting ground that’s been put together by free internet advocacy groups and nonprofits, is reporting a surge in the number of phone calls that it’s helped direct to Congress. Almost 400,000 calls have been made this week, according to the website, with 270,000 of those coming in the last 24 hours alone.

Over at Change.org, seven new petitions in support of net neutrality have been started up in the last two days, and older ones (like “Protect Net Neutrality From the Trump Administration”) have gained thousands of new signatures this week. Currently, Change.org logs 21 petitions related to net neutrality.

Reddit is flush with posts calling people to action, with top posters listing emails and phone numbers for members of both the FCC and Congress and offering scripts for people who need a bit of guidance. This is happening across subreddits, too — r/trebuchetmemes is calling people to action, someone at r/KerbalSpaceProgram planted a protest flag on a virtual moon in the spacefaring video game, and it’s even dividing the users who frequent r/The_Donald.

Meanwhile, organizers are trying to focus the groundswell into visible action in meatspace. Protests at Verizon stores around the country have been scheduled for December 7th — FCC chairman and author of the proposal Ajit Pai was once a lawyer for Verizon — and some Redditors are separately organizing one in front of the FCC headquarters on December 13th.

The proposed rollback of net neutrality protections has drawn ire from a number of companies and public figures. Facebook, Google, and Netflix have all issued statements in favor of the existing rules, while a group of more than 1,000 startups has published an open letter to Pai asking him to focus on new policies instead of dismantling regulations.

Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau this week said he was “very concerned” about the plan in an interview with Motherboard. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman published a letter of his own on Medium where he claims the FCC dismissed concerns raised by an investigation he ran that found that the public comment process “was being corrupted by the submission of enormous numbers of fake comments concerning the possible repeal of net neutrality rules.”

Politicians, Silicon Valley, and small businesses are speaking out with the public

Elected representatives are speaking out, too. Tulsi Gabbard, a Congresswoman in Hawaii, released a statement accusing Pai of “rewarding pay-to-play politics.” California senator Kamala Harris is collecting signatures in support of the existing rules in her own state.

And last evening, Jessica Rosenworcel, who currently serves on the FCC, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times titled “I'm on the FCC. Please stop us from killing net neutrality.”

“It’s a lousy idea. And it deserves a heated response from the millions of Americans who work and create online every day,” Rosenworcel wrote. She went on to argue that, despite the major effort that Americans have already put in over the last few years fighting for a free and open internet, this new challenge needs to be met with the same fervor. “I think the FCC needs to work for the public, and therefore that this proposal needs to be slowed down and eventually stopped. In the time before the agency votes, anyone who agrees should do something old-fashioned: Make a ruckus.”

So if you’re hoping to score a deal on the new Pixel 2 smartphones during this long weekend’s shopping events, I have some bad news. In fact, it doesn’t appear that any of the Pixel-branded devices announced back in October will be discounted, or at least the company hasn’t announced anything yet and we’re just 48 hours away from kickoff.

Here’s what you can expect, though.

The best Google product to buy on Black Friday

Google will be discounting its Google Home speakers and Chromecast dongles, both of which are great stocking stuffers or an affordable gift for friends and family. The Google Home Mini, announced in October, will see the steepest discount, dropping down from $49 to $29 with a $10 store credit, which effectively makes the device as cheap as $19.

If you do not want store credit to the Google Store, a ton of retailers are also offering store credit when you buy the Mini. eBay’s price-matching offer nets you a $10 eBay gift card, while Best Buy and Target will also offer $10 store credits for future purchases. Walmart will offer $25 credit off a future order when made through Google Express. This deal essentially gets you a Google Home Mini for just $4.

Other good deals

The full-sized Google Home will also see a discount down from $129 to $79 in the Google Store, Best Buy, and Target, with Walmart offering the same $25 Google Express credit when linking your accounts. Sorry, no major discounts on the Google Home Max.

Both the Chromecast and Chromecast Audio will be discounted from $35 to $25 in the Google Store, with Walmart and Best Buy offering the best deal at $20 for the regular Chromecast dongle. The Chromecast Ultra will see its price drop from $69 to $54.

So it boils down to this: the Walmart and Google Express deal offers two coupons per household, so if you’re looking to score multiple Minis for the house, be prepared to pick your favorite retailer and stock up on the colorful little speakers.","google home mini

Musk is well ahead of schedule (a rarity for Tesla!), with the 100MW battery set to be energised and tested in the coming days, according to a press release from the local state government.

Tesla Powerpacks have been installed and connected at Neoen's Hornsdale windfarm, north of Adelaide, and battery tests will be run to ensure local regulatory requirements are met before it begins operating on December 1st. South Australia suffered a state wide blackout last September, which sparked a highly politicized national debate about energy security. The Australian Government blamed the failure of renewable energy to cover usage. Musk's battery farm stores huge amounts of energy from renewable sources like wind and solar, and funnels it out to the grid when usage is high.

Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

Musk made his promise in March on Twitter and the 100-day countdown started at the end of September after the company inked a deal with the South Australian government. Musk essentially delivered his promise in about two months, well short of the self-imposed 100-day deadline. The battery is estimated to cost at least $50 million.

""The world’s largest lithium ion battery will be an important part of our energy mix, and it sends the clearest message that South Australia will be a leader [sic] renewable energy with battery storage,"" South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said in a statement.

Andrew Liptak,Cranberries in crisis,2016-11-23T18:10:19Z,the-verge,"To keep the cranberry industry in its birthplace, a farm turns to drones, data, and automation",https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/12640282/farming-technology-cranberry-industry-dji-phantom-drone-data,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yisKEKfIB00ixiks89i_-d2KNZA=/0x83:1024x659/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51978989/3010607529_7cc01b1878_b.0.jpeg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Keith Mann faces the same problem each year: frost.

The icy condensation is detrimental to his crop in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, the birthplace of the modern American cranberry industry. As the temperatures drop into the fall months, the owner of 150 acres of cranberry bogs throws on some layers and preps a network of sprinklers, which spray enough temperate water to keep the vines above freezing until the sun rises.

This is no small feat. With hundreds of sprinklers deployed across his field, checking each nozzle would require a team of people working throughout the night. Recently, Mann came across a solution: a drone.

“I’ve always been an RC enthusiast,” Mann told The Verge. “I’ve had RC helicopters and planes since I was a kid. What I find most useful is I can scan over all my acreage in a short period of time.”

Last Christmas, he purchased DJI Phantom 4 drone. In the early morning, he sends his drone over fields, providing him an aerial view of the land, allowing him to point out where some of the sprinkler heads aren’t activating. “Flying at 300 feet, they stick out like a sore thumb.”

Mann is just one of many Massachusetts farmers who have been using technology in innovative ways to adapt to a changing climate, along with increased competition from farmers in other states. In the birthplace of the cranberry industry, tech and data might hold the key to survival.

Changing with the times

Mann and his wife Monika now operate Mann Farms, which has become a forward-thinking farm within the Massachusetts industry. But he’s worked around cranberries all his life. “It’s a family business,” he said. “I’m a third-generation farmer on my father’s side, and a fourth-generation farmer on my mother’s.” His father holds the distinction of being the first to harvest the berries in the way that you’re probably most familiar: wet harvesting, when flooded bog fields are covered with floating cranberries. And his grandfather was one of Ocean Spray’s first salesmen.

Following the devastation of New Jersey Cranberry crops, researchers began developing new varieties

The cranberry industry, as Mann knows, has long benefited from technology of the time.

The industry that produces the cranberry juices, sauces, and snacks we see today on grocery store shelves turns two centuries old this year. Cranberries had been known to Native Americans for millennia, but in 1816 a former ship captain named Henry Hall began cultivating the wild plants on his property after he noticed that they grew better when covered with sand. The industry took off from there, fueled by the use of cranberries aboard transatlantic sailing ships.

Introduced in 1953 from the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station and US Department of Agriculture, the Stevens variety of cranberries was a blend of native plants from Massachusetts and Wisconsin and has become an industry standard. Crops had been threatened by diseases, and juice had become popular with consumers. Compared to the native varieties typically grown by Massachusetts farmers, Brian Wick, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association told The Verge that these newer berries are larger and produce more juice.

Farms in Wisconsin and Quebec, Wick explained, had a distinct advantage over their Massachusetts counterparts, and have come to dominate the industry. Because these farms are relative newcomers to the industry, they were able to start with the higher yield strains that had been developed by researchers. These high-yielding crops allow growers to become more effective right off the bat.

Newer farms in Wisconsin and Quebec have a distinct advantage over their Massachusetts counterparts

This proved to be a particular problem for Massachusetts farmers, who are working on the oldest cultivated bogs in the nation. Renovating an existing field is an extremely costly proposition: Mann estimated that it would cost anywhere from $20 to $40 thousand per acre and would take fields out of production for years. This is a real concern for Massachusetts farmers, who have fallen behind Wisconsin and Quebec famers in total annual yield.

Competition from out of state growers isn’t the only thing that has Massachusetts farmers concerned: rising temperatures and a changing climate has presented itself as an issue for growers.

Climate Change & Economic Factors

While California has been in the headlines for the sustained drought that has been affecting its farmers, New England has been facing one of its own. The Cape Cod Cranberry Grower’s Association said in August that the drought was the greatest concern for the local industry. “Although bogs are built with in-ground irrigation systems, they are generally not sufficient substitution for natural rainfall, which yields uniform sizing of the fruit.” While the annual US crop has been expected to rise slightly over last year’s harvest, Massachusetts growers are expecting 5 percent drop in crop yields, due in part to the conditions.

Cranberries are a water-intensive crop. In addition to requiring water to grow, farmers need water to irrigate their fields during freezing conditions in order to prevent frost damage. Water is required for harvesting as well: because cranberries float, farmers flood their fields and use machines to disturb the berries, which allows them to be collected from the water’s surface. Drought conditions complicate each step, sometimes forcing farmers to tap into reservoirs to provide their crops with water, which depletes the already low water levels in the region.

These troubles could be a sign of things to come for growers. In 2007, a report from Union of Concerned Scientists released the Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment, which examined the changing nature of the region.

The report found that the climate of the Northeastern corner of the United States (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont) has changed. The rise in temperatures since the 1970s has shortened the growing season and reduced the snow cover that the region receives during the winter. And the concern from climate change isn’t just limited to rising temperatures: more frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts and hurricanes, can have an enormous impact on growers.

Rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions will have an effect on the industry

The report also singled out cranberry growers. “According to NECIA projections, by mid-century, cranberry production will be at risk in southeastern Massachusetts, especially under the higher-emissions scenario,” its authors reported.

The result is more difficult growing conditions for farmers. In the coming decades, the climate of Massachusetts could become more like that of New Jersey, the report says.

Higher temperatures are particularly troublesome for cranberries. Cranberries aren’t particularly suited for warm climates: they require chilled temperatures in order to grow, says Nicholi Vorsa, the director of Rutgers University’s Philip E. Marucci Center for Blueberry and Cranberry Research and Extension in Chatsworth.

“Cranberries essentially have to be adapted to winter, fall, spring, and summer,” he says. “The plant will produce the crop, but the heat stress the berries will be exposed to is the greatest threat to the cranberry industry.”

Exposed to prolonged heat and sunlight, the berries are susceptible to damage. But there’s even more to worry about: in a warmer environment, fungal infections and rot are more likely, especially if the crops are overwatered in an attempt to cool them, Vorsa says.

Coping with changes

Despite the drought and competition from other growers, Mann says that his farm is on track to bring in a record harvest. Part of the solution is for farmers to optimize their farms as much as possible and to collect as much data as possible to guide decisions when it comes to production, Mann says.

By using temperature and water usage data collected from his fields to optimize his irrigation system, Mann reports that he has been able to cut his frost damages “more than in half.” He’s also used less water by automating the sprinklers to go on at precise times and at the right temperatures. “Now, we wait right to the last minute, which means pumps start hours after they used to, and sometimes don’t start at all,” Mann says.

“Last year was the best crop I ever had, and this year, we’re up 5 percent more.”

The results are quite promising. Mann declined to produce exact numbers, but he claims the increases in production on his farm were well above the average increases reported to Ocean Spray. “I’ve had, out of the past seven years, six of them have been some sort of record in crop. The trend is going up dramatically. Last year was the best crop I ever had, and this year, we’re up 5 percent more.” Mann pointed to the better irrigation systems as a component of that, but also that the new strains of cranberries play a major factor: a third of his crop is of the newest varieties, and produce more than double the heritage varieties he grows.

The Manns have invested in other technologies help offset the costs of running a farm. In 2015, he installed four wind turbines on his property, becoming the third-largest wind farm in the state.

Earlier this year, the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture released “The Massachusetts Cranberry Revitalization Task Force Final Report,” a 61-page document that outlined the efforts underway to address the variety of problems facing farmers in the state. It highlighted a number of potential solutions, such as bog renovation to help farmers update their crops and loan guarantees, tax credits, and grant programs to help with the financial burden of undertaking such a project. The report also recommended upgrading research facilities at UMass-Dartmouth and UMass-Amherst, and developing alternative energy development, much as Mann has done with his farm. “Massachusetts cranberry sector must respond to compete and remain sustainable,” the report’s authors wrote. “These improvements will position Massachusetts growers to be more strategically competitive, while being able to produce the quality and type of fruit demanded by a changing global marketplace.”

Across the industry, researchers including Vorsa have been working to continue to tinker with the various varieties of cranberries out there: new berries that will hopefully deal a bit better with higher temperatures and resist fungal infections. The Stevens variety, which has become a staple in the industry, was suited for the climate of the time that it was first released, in the 1950s. Newly developed varieties will be better suited for the new climate.

The threats to this crop are particularly ironic on Thanksgiving. Though many people will also serve apple pie — the American food of cliché — apples were in fact domesticated in the Middle East, and were introduced to the US by settlers. In contrast, Vorsa says, ""The American cranberry is native to North America, which is why we’re eating it this week.”","us department of agriculture the stevens variety of cranberries

Vlad Savov,This is serious,2017-11-23T13:24:17Z,the-verge,The US net neutrality fight affects the whole world,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/23/16693840/net-neutrality-us-fcc-global-effect,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_FGr9p1VKoSDN2Spv4w1NR-4AA=/0x310:2500x1619/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6261595/akrales_160329_0996_A_005.0.png,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The United States is a nation quarreling with itself right now. Most of the country’s population wants to keep the internet an equitable and free place, embracing net neutrality rules as a necessary guardian against corporate overreach. But the current political administration seems hellbent on dismantling net neutrality and handing internet service providers the freedom to mold, shape, manipulate, and price internet access in whatever fashion they like. The downsides to this regulatory repeal are too numerous and appalling to list, but you don’t have to agree that it’s a bad idea to see something else important about it: whatever the American authorities do with respect to the internet will have major repercussions for the rest of the world as well.

This seemingly internal fight overflows US borders in a number of important ways. Here are the two key aspects that trouble me, as someone who doesn’t reside in the US but interacts with a panoply of its internet services as a matter of daily and professional routine:

The rest of the world looks to America to set the example

You might think that, under the Trump administration, the United States has done a lot less leading than in generations past. Certainly, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, shunning Cuba after Obama had normalized relations, and looking to rescind the Iran nuclear deal are all signs of a country looking inward. But just because the US isn’t leading doesn’t mean that others aren’t following. A butterfly flapping its wings in the US tends to cause a rippling of effects in the countries looking to the States for guidance.

I’m not talking about France or the Netherlands here. Countries with a modern, well developed, and functioning jurisprudence can navigate their own way through the challenges of regulating internet access. They’re far less likely (though not immune) to be swayed by events and decisions taking place in the United States. Especially under Emmanuel Macron’s leadership, France wants to be seen as a more enlightened, more welcoming alternative to a United States that seems to be losing its religious and cultural tolerance. But France is part of a very small exception.

The countries most susceptible to being misled by the United States’ bad example in terms of internet regulation are those who treat American culture as a guiding light, as something superior to their own. I come from Bulgaria, and that’s exactly the phenomenon that’s been at play there for most of my lifetime: when the communist regime was removed in 1989, its place was taken up by a corruption-riddled economic liberalism and a deluge of American cultural exports. The first time a McDonald’s outlet opened in my nearest city, it was treated like the opening of a Michelin-starred restaurant. And yes, we have Black Friday deals even without the Thanksgiving tradition, just like most of the rest of the world.

Bulgaria is only one example of dozens of countries that are broadly grouped together in the “developing” category. We look for external examples, for best practices when handling complex matters like the internet, and the US is the obvious first port of call. It’s where Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and most of the other tech companies we admire hail from. We may not follow the US example with things like health care and capital punishment — because we also have millennia of experience with both — but given how the US practically invented the internet we know now, it seems reasonable to expect that its regulatory system must be operating in the most efficient manner possible. Right?

Among the budding nations looking for a role model is India, which is still formulating its approach to net neutrality. Facebook has already trampled over net neutrality principles in the country with its zero-rated Free Basics, though the Indian authorities effectively banned the practice with a ruling last year. Where India goes from here will be of major significance for the future, given the country’s huge population and rapid growth in the number of people getting online. Could Indian net neutrality rules survive in the context of a US stripped of all net neutrality protections?

Online services may become more expensive outside the US if they are more expensive to provide in the US

A big problem with internet infrastructure within the US is a lack of competition between providers. It’s true that no ISP owns the entire US market, but the way they’ve arranged their services is such that de facto monopolies exist in various municipalities. Recode’s Albert Wenger, for instance, has only one provider choice in Manhattan (also known as: no choice at all!), whereas a Londoner like me could pick from BT, Virgin, Sky, TalkTalk, Plusnet, mobile companies dabbling in home broadband like EE and Vodafone, and a smattering of smaller providers.

The aberrantly uncompetitive US ISP market leads to situations where someone like Comcast or Spectrum can effectively dictate whatever terms it likes to its customers. The only protection against that is government regulation, installing rules of conduct for these providers to follow. Without net neutrality, an unshackled Comcast can start putting together nightmarish (by which I mean “just like cable TV”) tiers or bundles of internet access that will be good for Comcast’s bottom line, but bad for consumers and bad for online services.

If Netflix and Amazon are forced to pay additional fees to have their streaming services included in Comcast’s “good” bundles, the end result is that we, the consumers, will bear that cost. And since Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are international services, those costs are likely to trickle down to unsuspecting customers beyond the US as well.

Another, more ephemeral, issue that arises from the absence of net neutrality is that companies like Netflix need to develop the necessary skill and tool set to navigate an internet that doesn’t guarantee a level playing field. That means hiring people adept at negotiating deals with internet providers, and it means figuring out ways to leverage and exploit the lack of neutrality. Netflix has already been dabbling with that, flip-flopping on whether it supports net neutrality or not. Developing the requisite expertise to compete on an unequal footing costs time and money, but once Netflix has it for the US market, it’s going to be much more likely to seek to export it overseas and make the most of it. In this way, an unregulated US internet would feed directly into a push to instill the same legal environment elsewhere.

Is this really what we want the internet to become? A place full of ignoble economic incentives driving companies to engage in ethically dubious anticompetitive behavior? Internet service providers are doing pretty well in the US even with the currently extant net neutrality laws, which exist mostly to curb those companies’ worst impulses.

Why should we distort and disfigure the economics of internet access — something so essential to modern life that countries now treat it as a legal right — just to appease companies that face no threat of going out of business? The global influence of the United States, and of American online companies, also means that repealing net neutrality within the country’s borders would pose an existential threat to net neutrality around the world.

Russell Brandom,I am thankful for all these eerily plausible cybersecurity scenarios,2017-11-23T14:35:16Z,the-verge,The Mr. Robot Hack Report: Worst Thanksgiving ever,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/23/16694118/mr-robot-hack-report-s3e7-fredrick-tanya,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vTy9w1r4FETStA7owe3Db9nRUzY=/0x72:1000x596/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9740937/NUP_179716_0002.JPG,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Mr. Robot is back, and the C Y B E R is back, too. The show takes a special interest in showing off the details that usually get glossed over, often drawing on real hacks and real cybersecurity problems. So after every episode, I’ll be breaking down who got hacked, how, and with what. It turns out, there’s a lot more to each one than you can see on-screen.

Well that was extremely upsetting! There’s no show this week because of Thanksgiving, which is probably just as well because I am FURIOUS. Trenton and Mobley were arguably the coolest characters on the show (more Trenton than Mobley, if we’re being real), and now they’re both gone, sacrificial pawns in the Dark Army’s fiendish game. Leon must have known, right? No good.

In a broader sense, it’s starting to look like the Dark Army is just getting everything they want. America is in chaos, E Coin is ascendant, and the whole Stage Two mess has been pawned off on F Society and Iran. As a cherry on top, we even got Zhang’s public humiliation of Price at their fancy evildoers’ soiree. Plus, a bunch of Knight Rider references, which is basically a win for everyone.

THE FIENDISH PLOT

The biggest hack this week came at the end, when Trenton and Mobley are taken to the Dark Army’s hacker lair and get a sense of the mysterious post-Stage Two plot that Dom’s been hearing so much about. (I like to think of it as Stage 2.1.) It seems like a false flag, but the Dark Army really did their homework on it. On the table, there’s a map of airspace routes and the next screen shows a list of vulnerabilities in Oracle’s Weblogic software (you can find a more recent version here), which is presumably what their local airport is running on their servers. There are also a mess of onscreen Python scripts, including “weblogic.py” and “serializekiller.py,” neither of which seem like good news. The next screen shows layout tools for the FAA’s flight data service and enterprise messaging system — basically all the stuff you would use if you were trying to hack a bunch of airplanes out of the sky.

Trenton and Mobley put a button on this when the Dark Army handler asks them what they see:

Trenton: A threat analysis for the FAA’s NextGen IP-based system. Mobley: Targeting IPs in Chicago, Atlanta and LA. Trenton: This is malware that targets air traffic control systems at major airports. Mobley: They’re planning another attack…probably like today except this time they’re crashing planes.

It’s diabolical! And unlike 5/9 or even Stage Two, it would be aimed more at causing general mayhem and death than damaging Evil Corp specifically or capitalism in general. Setting up all this stuff seems more about framing Trenton and Mobley than actually executing the hack, but it’s still scary to have an idea like that kicking around. Could they really do something like this?

PLANES IN THE SKY

In broad strokes, this is surprisingly viable hack. The air traffic control system is the heart of air travel, the single network that makes most of the decisions for what planes do in the air. If you could compromise it, you could cause serious chaos — and compromising it isn’t nearly as hard as it should be. The best protection is that the computers running air traffic control — known as National Air Space or NAS systems — are supposed to be kept separate from the internet at large. Unfortunately, a 2015 review by the Government Accountability Office found there were lots of places to jump from networked computers onto NAS systems. The review also found that air traffic systems were terrible at patching and not great at sensing network intrusions either, all of which would make things a lot easier for hackers.

There are also ways to cause trouble without breaking directly into air-traffic systems. In a talk at Defcon in 2012, Brad “Renderman” Haines laid out a plan for spoofing the ADS-B transponders that airplanes use to locate each other in the sky. At the time, the signals weren’t encrypted, letting researchers like Haines easily copy them. The result would be a “ghost plane,” a signal that looks like a real plane to air traffic controllers. If an attacker could create enough ghost planes at once, it could cause nearly as much damage as hacking into the air traffic system directly. That’s particularly relevant because we’re likely to see very similar systems in cars as part of the push for self-driving tech, which will be vulnerable to very similar hacks.

That’s it! The show will be back next week, so you can see our beautiful faces again instead of just reading words on a screen. In the meantime, hit us up on Twitter or Reddit if there’s anything you’re wondering. And have a nice flight!","faa’s nextgen ipbased system

It’s also a great time to finally get around to one of those shows that you’ve been meaning to binge-watch. There’s a glut of really fantastic shows out there. Here are our recommendations for something to stream while you’re sitting on the couch in a turkey-induced stupor.

SO HOT RIGHT NOW

Marvel’s The Punisher (Netflix)

Frank Castle, aka The Punisher, is out for revenge after the events of Daredevil. From the start of the season, Castle is a recluse, carrying massive emotional baggage from his time in Afghanistan. Drawn out of his shell by a string of compelling characters played by Amber Rose Revah, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and others, Castle gradually grows more likable to the audience just as the story picks up speed, diving into police conspiracy and shootouts. It’s a violent and explicit series about US veterans and enraged single white men released at a time when America has been wracked by mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas, meaning that it’s rife with material to discuss after the credits roll. —Shannon Liao

Best seen with: It’s a two-fer: you can watch it with your fellow Destiny 2 guardians and enjoy the gore, or discuss the underlying issues with your more politically minded family members.

Mindhunter (Netflix)

Shows about serial killers are nothing new, but this series pulls off a neat trick by focusing on the people that figured out how to hunt them down in the first place. Based on John E. Douglas and Mark Olshaker’s book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit, the show follows a pair of mismatched FBI agents (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) and a psychology professor (Anna Torv) who begin interviewing serial killers in the 1970s in order to understand why they do the things that they do. With David Fincher executive producing (and directing the pilot), Mindhunter is filled with the kind of unrelenting tension the filmmaker excels at, and infamous serial killers like Richard Speck and Edmund Kemper even pop up as characters. Be sure to stay for the final scene of the season, which plays like a lead-in to the most insidious expanded universe in the history of entertainment. —Bryan Bishop

Best seen with: Ask your friends and family if they liked Seven, Zodiac, True Detective, or The Silence of the Lambs. If they say yes, you’re good to go.

Channel Zero, “No-End House” (SyFy, YouTube)

Channel Zero is an anthology series with self-contained seasons that are based on ""creepypasta,"" the internet's equivalent of spooky campfire tales. It made a decent debut in 2016, but really hit its stride with this fall's six-episode ""No-End House,"" where four young adults enter a haunted house and come out in a mirror world that preys on their dreams and fears. Beyond some effective grotesquerie and familiar horror tropes, you’ll get a compelling story about protagonist Margot (The Path's Amy Forsyth), who finds a way to reconnect with her dead father (American Horror Story's John Carroll Lynch) through the house. At its best, it's a surprisingly complex tragedy about the bonds of family and friendship... just a deeply, deeply creepy one. —Adi Robertson

Best seen with: Anyone interested in a more focused and less edgy version of American Horror Story, or a longer and more character-driven take on The Twilight Zone.

IT'S TIME WE CAUGHT UP

Stargate Universe (Stargate Command)

The third entry in Syfy’s Stargate franchise, Universe is a much darker, more somber show than its predecessors Stargate SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis. In it, a space expedition is unexpectedly stranded billions of miles from home on an ancient starship called Destiny. The show is less episodic, and more story-driven than the shows that preceded it, focusing on the more gritty, realistic characters as they work to survive as they try and find their way home. —Andrew Liptak

Best seen with: Anyone who’s enjoyed the latest season of Star Trek: Discovery, Battlestar Galactica, or The Expanse.

Program-your-own Taikathon (Netflix / Amazon / streaming)

With Thor: Ragnarok in theaters, millions of mainstream moviegoers who have never heard of writer-director Taika Waititi are becoming familiar with his improv comedy style. This is a great time to catch up on his past projects, which lack the superhero throwdowns and ’splosions, but have the same sort of goofy, amiable, self-effacing humor. The funniest of the pack is Hunt for the Wilderpeople, a wild family adventure about a teenager and his adoptive uncle taking off into the wilds. That one’s rentable on a variety of streaming services. Netflix has Eagle vs. Shark, Waititi’s ridiculously dry rom-com starring his longtime comedy partner Jemaine Clement. And Amazon Prime has his improvised dark vampire comedy What We Do In the Shadows and his funny family drama Boy, about an 11-year-old meeting his absentee criminal father.

Best seen with: Family members with a sense of humor, though you might want to fine-tune that — Hunt for the Wilderpeople is all-ages family fun, while What We Do In The Shadows is more for you and the cool younger cousins who like gross-out humor. —Tasha Robinson

The Night Manager (Amazon)

This suspense-driven TV mini-series on Amazon will give you a taste of international intrigue while you cuddle up with blankets in your home. Tom Hiddleston plays the night manager at a hotel in Cairo who anticipates the needs of his guests, but not the secret documents that draw him into a web of espionage. As a British soldier turned luxury hotel employee, Hiddleston possesses all the charm of Loki, who he plays in the Thor franchise, but less of the mischief. In six too-short episodes, this spy drama enlightens and entertains. —Shannon Liao

Best seen with: Adults who will appreciate the jet-setting and spy thrills.

Schitt's Creek (Netflix)

Created by Eugene Levy (Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman) and his son Dan, Schitt's Creek is about a wealthy family of four who find themselves living in a crappy motel in a nowhere town when all their belongings are unexpectedly repossessed by the IRS. This half-hour series, which also airs on Canadian TV, feels like a secret that I want to tell everyone about: it's deeply funny, strange, and just heartwarming enough to keep your head in the game during the holidays. The characters, including an overwrought Catherine O'Hara, manage to be annoying and likable at the same time — maybe like your own family? —Lizzie Plaugic

Watch it with: Your siblings, who will roll their eyes at first, and then get angry if you binge it without them.

OLDIES BUT GOODIES

The Great British Baking Show (Netflix)

It doesn't matter if you don't know what choux pastry or proofing is, watching The Great British Baking Show feels like wrapping your entire body in a warm loaf of freshly baked something or other. At least, it does until the end of each episode when someone gets eliminated and you're suddenly crying for reasons you can't quite explain. Another reason to cry: last year, three of the hosts quit after it was announced that the show would leave the BBC for the UK's Channel 4. The newest iteration of the series premiered this September to mixed reviews, but four seasons of the BBC version are on Netflix right now. That should last you to the pie course, at least. —Lizzie Plaugic

Watch with: Your cousin who says her pumpkin pie is better than yours.

Halt and Catch Fire (Netflix)

On a surface level, Halt and Catch Fire is about the rise of computers in the late ‘80s, and the lives of a few fictionalized people who built them. The show’s main trio — a slick salesman, a downtrodden engineer, and a quirky but brilliant programmer — initially read like stock characters in a college play. But their struggles to understand one another, and their individual failures as humans, soon make this drama a compelling, relatable watch. The show just wrapped its fourth and final season in October, but the first three seasons are streaming now on Netflix. —Megan Farokhmanesh

Watch with: Your family members who have nostalgia for the days of modems, and / or constantly ask you for tech support.

Spaced (Hulu)

Long before Baby Driver, Hot Fuzz, J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek, or even Shaun of the Dead, actor Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright worked together on a UK sitcom called Spaced. The premise sounds pretty well-worn by now: Pegg plays an aspiring comic artist who is so desperate for a new apartment that he pretends to be in a relationship with a total stranger (Jessica Stevenson) so the pair can land a new place as flatmates. Hijinks and romance ensue, along with an avalanche of pop culture references. Pegg and Stevenson created the show together, with Wright directing both seasons, and it’s combination of whimsy and effervescent filmmaking still make it a joy to watch, even if it does feels slightly dated at times. —Bryan Bishop

Watch with: Fans of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy and anyone who pines for the days before fan culture had been weaponized to fill every moment of our waking lives.","the

If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines of this particular mid-generation console race, now might be a good time to jump in.

Not only are there are a bunch of good deals on affordable 4K HDR TVs to take advantage of the visual upgrades, but there’s finally a healthy slate of games optimized for the faster, more powerful hardware.

We’ve rounded up the best deals on standard console hardware and PC parts, games, and accessories so you don’t have to comb through those confusing, anachronistic holiday flier PDF files. With Black Friday starting this Thursday on Thanksgiving and going through Cyber Monday, be sure to double check store hours and whether a certain retailer is offering discounts for in-store purchases, online-only, or both.

The best gaming deals of Black Friday

Microsoft won’t likely discount its new One X console for many months, but Sony and GameStop are offering the first available price drop on the PS4 Pro, from $399.99 to $349.99. It’s a Black Friday deal, so act fast if you’ve been saving up for Sony’s new hardware. If you’re in the market for an Xbox One S, Microsoft is in fact offering its lowest-ever price on that device at $189.

Unfortunately, given Nintendo’s penchant for keeping its prices high, there are not many meaningful deals on either Switch hardware or marquee Switch games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Super Mario: Odyssey. But you can get your hands on the new 2DS Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time special edition for $79.99 if you’re willing to go find one in-store as early as possible.

(Note: Many of the hardware deals are identical across retailers due to blanket discount policies from Microsoft and Sony. We’ve listed each hardware deal under the respective retailer when appropriate. So while choosing Best Buy over Target or GameStop won’t mean saving more money, it does mean you have a higher chance of nabbing the deal.)

It’s a strange omission, especially considering the Pro’s relatively high asking price, but it’s one that may be remedied in future iterations of the hardware. Chrome Unboxed has discovered details that point at the addition, though it’s unclear what form it might take. It may be added as part of a second run of the current hardware, or a feature included in a rumored beefed-up version of the Chromebook Pro. While it’s not official yet, the change would make the Pro a much more enticing option in the increasingly crowded Chromebook landscape.","hardware

Both a console and a portable, it allows you to play games in a variety of contexts — which means there are plenty of ways to utilize it over Thanksgiving weekend. You can play games together, all alone, or simply be a spectator. Here are a few options for that post-turkey time.

Trade football for e-sports

The NFL is the traditional sport of Thanksgiving, but professional football isn’t exactly a game for everyone. What if you want a game that’s a little shorter and less complex? Something with more color and style? In that case, you might want to boot up a copy of Splatoon 2. Nintendo’s ink-stained competitive shooter is a great spectator sport. A match lasts just a few minutes, and the game is incredibly simple to understand; whichever side covers the level in the most paint, wins. There’s no checking out Wikipedia to see how a tiebreaker works.

Even better, Nintendo is releasing a massive update for the game today, which includes a deluge of new hairstyle and clothing options to deck out your squids with, as well as more music and a handful of quality-of-life improvements. And starting tomorrow, the game will receive a new map: set in a squid-themed big-box store, just in time for Black Friday.

If post-apocalyptic paintball isn’t your style, there’s also the recent Switch version of Rocket League. It’s essentially soccer, but with cars in place of people. This makes it both easy to follow, and strangely entertaining to watch.

Work as a team

One of the great things about the Switch is that it’s a dead-simple machine for multiplayer. Even if you just have a single tablet and the packed-in Joy-Con controllers, you can still get in some co-op action. Naturally, there are a handful of games designed with this feature in mind.

Your best bet is likely Snipperclips, which recently received a hefty expansion with some challenging new puzzles. The game puts you and another player in the role of pieces of paper, who need to snip each other into different shapes to complete an array of goals. It’s cute and charming, but also devious; solving puzzles necessitates working together closely, and it’s very easily to accidentally snip your partner and ruin everything. But when you actually pull things off, it’s incredibly satisfying.

Meanwhile, Super Mario Odyssey offers a very different style of co-operative play, one that’s well-suited for introducing newcomers to the game. In two-player mode, one person is in control of Mario, while the other takes on the role of his sentient hat, Cappy. Mario still does most of the work, but Cappy can help out by tossing himself at enemies and other points of interest. It’s perfect for younger players or those who can’t deal with Odyssey’s many treacherous jumps.

Ignore everyone

Being around your family for the holidays can be fun — but you’ll likely need to escape at some point. With a big, meaty game played in portable mode, the Switch is ideal for this. The most obvious candidate to play is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Its sprawling rendition of Hyrule is easy to get lost in, and offers up all manner of places to explore. Plus, you can do some virtual cooking while you wait for the real food to arrive.

But if you’ve already exhausted what Link’s latest adventure has to offer, there are plenty of other options. The recently released remasters of Skyrim and LA Noire feel great on the Switch, while role-playing gems like I Am Setsuna or Disgaea 5 will make the hours melt away. And if you need something a bit more relaxing, you can’t go wrong with the soothing farming game Stardew Valley.

Get out some aggression

Being around family, especially during the holidays, can be stressful. And there are few better ways of relieving stress than punching things. Nintendo’s fighting game Arms utilizes the system’s motion controls, so — with a controller in each hand — you can swing your arms around to simulate knocking the stuffing out of your opponents.

It’s a surprisingly family-friendly experience — don’t expect Mortal Kombat levels of blood or gore — with a roster of charming and diverse characters. Arms can be played solo, but includes multiplayer options for up to four people, so you can get everyone involved in the celebratory pugilism. If nothing else, it’s a great way to work off that second helping of turkey.","postapocalyptic

While the massive data breach at Uber Technologies Inc. didn’t happen under the watch of its new chief executive, more than two months elapsed before he notified affected customers and drivers of the incident, people familiar with the matter said.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi learned of the breach, which Uber said happened in October 2016 and affected some 57 million accounts, about two weeks after he officially took the helm on Sept. 5, one of the people said. Mr. Khosrowshahi said he immediately ordered an investigation, which he wanted to complete before making the matter public.

About three weeks ago, though, Uber disclosed the investigation and the broad outlines of the breach to SoftBank Group Corp., which is considering a multibillion-dollar investment in the ride-hailing company, according to other people familiar with the matter. Uber officials, including its chief security officer, knew at the time of the breach that personal information had been accessed. Uber only informed customers and drivers on Tuesday.

Under way at the time of the disclosure to SoftBank was an investigation led by FireEye Inc.’s Mandiant forensics arm. Uber had to conduct multiple interviews with employees and others, as well as review accounts, to determine how many customers and drivers were impacted, one of the people said. The company disclosed the breach to the public only after it could put a firm number on how many accounts were affected and cut ties with two executives who it said mishandled the breach, this person said.

Uber disclosed on Tuesday that it paid hackers $100,000 to destroy the stolen data and decided not to inform consumers or authorities. Those actions occurred under its former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, who resigned as CEO in June. He learned of the attack in November 2016 and authorized the payment, according to people familiar with the matter.

Several states, along with the Federal Trade Commission and at least three European government agencies, opened inquiries this week into why it took Uber more than a year to disclose the breach. Uber says it is cooperating with various government offices to discuss the matter. It isn’t clear what penalties, if any, Uber may face.

Mr. Khosrowshahi was brought in to put a new face on the company after a year of scandals and legal setbacks. Uber has in the past faced criticism for putting its business interests ahead of its customers, including by using a since-discontinued software program that allowed employees to track customers’ movements.

Other companies have been criticized for making disclosures of data breaches after shorter periods than the more than two months people familiar with the matter say Mr. Khosrowshahi allowed to elapse.

Equifax Inc., for example, was faulted by lawmakers last month for taking just under six weeks after learning of its own massive data breach to disclose it publicly. The hack compromised the personal information of more than 145 million consumers. Yahoo Inc. faced similar criticism for revealing it didn’t promptly investigate a 2014 incident involving 500 million accounts. Both companies have said they reported the incidents as quickly as possible.

“In the U.S. today, most laws allow six to eight weeks for companies to notify regulators and consumers,” said Bo Holland, the chief executive of AllClear ID Inc., a company that helps corporations respond to data breaches. Even companies that meet this standard can suffer tarnished reputations because consumers and investors expect a speedier response, he said in an email message.

“Equifax met the letter of the law, no one was happy with their response, and the executives and shareholders suffered the consequences,” he said.

Because there are no federal laws on breach notification, incidents such as the Uber hack are covered by a patchwork of 48 state laws, the strongest of which require companies to notify consumers directly as soon as possible after personally identifiable information is compromised.

Uber is subject to these laws in states where it does business. Non-compliance with the laws exposes Uber to a range of state penalties and to consumer lawsuits.

“The provisions that allow for delay are not about getting your new management in order,” said Deirdre Mulligan, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who served as an adviser to lawmakers during the creation of California’s breach-notification law, which requires companies to notify consumers as soon as possible after a breach but doesn’t specify a time period. The California Department of Justice declined to comment, citing its policy of not commenting on possible investigations.

Uber, which is based in San Francisco, said names, email addresses and phone numbers for millions of riders were accessed, as well as the driver’s license numbers for about 600,000 drivers. The unauthorized access of those names and numbers would have triggered the requirement for such a disclosure in California, Ms. Mulligan said.

Uber said the investigation, for which it hired outside forensics experts, found no evidence that consumers’ financial information was taken or that the personal information obtained was used to commit fraud, such as identity theft.

After being contacted by the hackers, Uber pushed them to join the company’s “bug bounty” program, which pays people for information about flaws in the company’s software, according to people familiar with the matter. The hackers agreed to join the program and Uber paid them the $100,000. The company said it was assured by the hackers the stolen data was destroyed.

“You may be asking why we are just talking about this now, a year later,” said Mr. Khosrowshahi in a blog post. “I had the same question, so I immediately asked for a thorough investigation of what happened and how we handled it.”

The company didn’t disclose publicly until this week that it had earlier notified SoftBank of the investigation.

“We informed SoftBank that we were investigating a data breach, consistent with our duty to disclose to a potential investor, even though our information at the time was preliminary and incomplete,” Uber said in a statement Wednesday. “We also made clear that our forensic investigation was ongoing. However, once our internal inquiry concluded and we had a more complete understanding of the facts, we disclosed to regulators and our customers in a very public way.”

Uber has been scrambling to shore up its investment deal with SoftBank, worth as much as $10 billion, including at least $1 billion that would go directly to Uber’s coffers. But the process has been slowed by talks over the price at which SoftBank would offer to buy billions in shares from existing stakeholders, in a process known as a tender offer, according to people familiar with the matter.

Uber needed to disclose the breach to its customers and drivers before the tender offer because a breach of this size and scope could be considered material to investors, people familiar with the matter said, and could affect the price at which SoftBank offers to buy shares. SoftBank is expected to settle on a fixed price for the offer as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter say.

Millions of consumers are using their phones to shop instead of lining up at stores after chowing down on turkey this year, accelerating a fundamental change in holiday shopping as more consumers spend online.

Better mobile e-commerce sites and easy one-click payment options—as well as earlier deals—are making the 24 hours that started Thursday evening the biggest online spending period of the year, according to retail experts. The period is expected to eclipse Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, and give brick-and-mortar stores new competition for Black Friday.

Software company Adobe Systems Inc. reports that online sales as of 5 p.m. Thursday grew 17% to $1.52 billion, while traffic from smartphones increased 15% year-over-year.

Consumers last year spent 19% more online on Black Friday than on Cyber Monday, according to Salesforce.com Inc.’s Commerce Cloud, which analyzes data from 500 million shoppers world-wide across more than 2,750 retail sites. Salesforce expects the pattern to repeat again this year. Over Thanksgiving weekend last year, an estimated 109 million people shopped online, compared with 99 million in stores, according to a National Retail Federation survey.

The ease of shopping on phones has helped push that trend, prompting consumers who previously just researched deals online to actually click the buy button, said Rob Garf, vice president of industry strategy and insights at Salesforce, which works with companies including L’Oréal SE, Adidas AG and PetSmart Inc. Mobile devices have helped “equal the playing field as technology caught up with demand.”

Where to Bag the Bargains The WSJ is monitoring prices for 10 popular toys available at Amazon, Target, Toys ‘R’ Us and Wal-Mart.

More than half of Amazon.com Inc.’s shoppers last Thanksgiving used their mobile devices to access the site, the company said.

“Honestly, I think there’s a time during Thanksgiving festivities where you’re a little burnt out on too many people, too much conversation,“ said Dorion Carroll, vice president of mobile shopping at Amazon. So people sneak off to do a little gift shopping. He admits, “I do that.”

So did Rachel Guffey. After her Thanksgiving dinner and a round of family trivia, the 33-year-old dog treat baker from Lawrence, Kan., started shopping on her phone “right here in my pocket” for cheap videogames and DVDs on Amazon and Target Corp.

“It’s just a lot more convenient,” she says.

Amazon is the largest beneficiary by far of the boom in mobile e-commerce starting on Thanksgiving. It has captured about 42 cents of every dollar spent online this year on average, according to market research firm Slice Intelligence, which tracks a panel of more than 5 million U.S. shoppers.

Related UPS Move Pressures Retailers

Traditional retailers are hoping to get in on some of the action. Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target are spending heavily on e-commerce by improving shipping speeds or website infrastructure. But they haven’t given up on foot traffic. Lower prices and different deals in store—as well as offers to pick up online orders—are among the tactics brick-and-mortar retailers are attempting this holiday season.

Brick-and-mortar retailers are also adding mobile perks, including notifying sales associates of shopper preferences, pinging customers with deals and using in-store beacon technology to direct shoppers to express checkout lines. This helps secure purchases as customers check prices on their phones.

“Even if you go to the store, you are still shopping on mobile,” adds Nitin Mangtani, founder and chief executive of mobile commerce platform PredictSpring and former head of Google Shopping. He works with retailers including Calvin Klein and Charlotte Russe.

As more people shop online earlier in the holiday weekend, stores are adapting. Some stores, like outdoor retailer Recreational Equipment Inc., are closed for Thanksgiving and Black Friday, while others have cut back on or changed hours.

Holiday Shopping on the Move Online commerce on Thanksgiving has soared in recent years, with mobile purchases taking an increasing share of the total. Share of e-commerce traffic on Thanksgiving done on mobile Share of e-commerce traffic on mobile, by hour (2016) 65 % Peak traffic 59%

Here's what the messages say. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)

Donald Trump Jr. had just posted a batch of private mes­sages he exchanged with Wiki­Leaks during last year’s campaign, confirming reports that he communicated with the website that published stolen Democratic emails obtained by Russian military intelligence.

“More nothing burgers from the media and others desperately trying to create a false narrative,” the president’s oldest son wrote on Instagram. “Keep coming at me guys!!!”

Over the course of the week, Trump Jr. went on to tweet or retweet criticism of his father’s 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton; actor George Takei; Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.); and former vice president Joe Biden, sharing unsubstantiated claims about him from an anonymously sourced blog post.

Faced with deepening scrutiny of contacts he had in 2016 with people tied to Russia, the 39-year-old has adopted a provocative response: defiance.

In public appearances and on Twitter, Trump Jr. has taken an increasingly caustic tone, mocking critics and shoving himself into the scrum of the country’s most polarizing debates.

It’s an unorthodox legal strategy for someone under scrutiny by congressional investigators, whose every word could be used against him. But the approach fits with the real estate executive’s growing public persona as a right-wing provocateur and ardent defender of Trumpism.

“He’s very smart to be in the spotlight,” said Charlie Kirk, a friend and the founder of the conservative college and high school group Turning Point USA. “Would they stop the investigation if he stopped tweeting? He’s in a situation where either you defend yourself, reassure the base, reassure the supporters, or stay silent. And if you’re totally silent, it only increases suspicion.”

The Trump base is with him, Kirk added: “Most people can’t even keep up with this stuff, anyway.”

The Russia-related controversies have heightened Trump Jr.’s rising profile. Once a supporting character on his father’s reality TV show, the vice president of the family business is now an in-demand figure on the paid speaking circuit and a political player all his own.

Last month, he delivered a speech on the field of the cavernous Dallas Cowboys stadium, sounding off to a group of University of North Texas donors about “liberal imperialists,” media “vitriol” and universities that “train your children to hate our country.”

After the speech, for which Trump Jr. was paid $100,000, “he did selfies with half the people who showed up,” said G. Brint Ryan, a Republican mega-donor and Trump adviser whose tax firm co-sponsored the 800-attendee event.

Within hours, Trump Jr. was back on Twitter lashing out at his father’s targets, including Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake (“liberal globalist”), Clinton (“arrogance and entitlement”) and “opposition” protesters (“apparently my 3 year old is consulting”).

Two weeks later, he was billed as the featured guest at a party for Trump administration staff held in a chandelier-lit study at Trump’s Washington hotel, where dozens of high-ranking officials sipped cocktails and Trump wine from the family’s Virginia vineyard.



This image of Donald Trump Jr.'s Twitter account shows a series of direct messages he received from the Twitter account behind the WikiLeaks website, including his responses to the communications, which he posted Nov. 13. (Associated Press)

Trump Jr. referred questions about his activities to the family’s private company, which did not respond to requests for comment. His brother Eric Trump said in a statement that “Don and I are totally dedicated to running our family business, The Trump Organization, which has been an incredible experience.”

“While our sole focus remains on the business, our father has the most important job in the world, and we could not be more proud of all that he has accomplished in his first year,” he said to The Washington Post. “Don and I will always remain his biggest advocates and supporters.”

Trump Jr.’s attorney, Alan Futerfas, said his client is exercising his freedom to speak his mind as a private citizen.

“He is simply voicing thoughts and concerns and his hopes for America that he shared on the campaign trail,” Futerfas said in an interview. “He cares deeply about these issues, and there’s no reason that he should not continue to express his opinion.”

Friends say the flame-throwing by Trump Jr. — a devoted outdoorsman and father of five who spent the campaign revving up voters at camping outfitters and shooting ranges­ — is merely the response of a loyal son.

“If you were him and watching the mainstream liberal media attack your father day after day, it would get kind of tiresome and you’d react, too,” said Doug Deason, a wealthy Dallas donor and investor who joined Trump Jr. last month for a pro-Trump super PAC’s fundraising-strategy session at oilman T. Boone Pickens’s mega-ranch.

Others who know Trump Jr. see grander ambitions. He is “more of a politician than his father,” said Louise Sunshine, a former Trump Organization executive who has known the Trump kids since they were born. “Donald was a businessman . . . but Donald Trump Jr. is making it his business to be a politician.”

[Conservationists look to Donald Trump Jr. as their champion in new White House]

Trump Jr. did not always appear destined to follow his father’s path, moving to Aspen after college for a year of fly-fishing and bartending. But by the time his father launched his White House bid, Trump Jr. was a key purveyor of the family brand, having joined the family business and co-starred as a “boardroom advisor” on Trump’s reality show “The Apprentice.”

He traveled almost constantly for 18 months as his father’s surrogate, mixing his outdoorsman bona fides with sharp swipes at Clinton, at one point warning she would reshape the United States into a “socialist state.”

After the election, Trump Jr. and his brother took over managing the Trump Organization, which their father still owns. Eric Trump told The Post in February that “the company and policy and government are completely separated. We have built an unbelievable wall in between the two.”

This year, Trump Jr. attended the openings of a Trump-brand hotel in Vancouver and a luxury golf complex in Dubai. Later this month, when his sister, Ivanka, heads to India as part of a White House trip, Trump Jr. will travel there, too, to help launch two Trump-branded tower projects in Kolkata and Gurgaon.

But much of his public calendar appears dominated by politics rather than business. In recent months, he has headlined GOP dinners, fundraisers and rallies in Indiana, Texas and Montana.

Some organizers said they broke fundraising records after donors flocked to hear his stories of life as a Trump. At one event for the Indiana Republican Party in May, he said the first person to call his brother when Eric was expecting his first child wasn’t his father, but Vice President Pence.

Last month, a day after the Trump hotel division announced it had hired a new vice president, Trump Jr. was hunting pheasants with a shotgun alongside Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), one of his father’s top supporters.

Presidential children traditionally serve to soften and humanize their fathers, reminding voters that the nation’s leader can be a family man, too. But Trump Jr. has sharpened his father’s ­already-pointed edges, often amplifying the president’s grudges.

On Twitter, he regularly jabs at the president’s antagonists, from liberal media personalities to Republican politicians to kneeling football players. Responding on Tuesday to a CNN guest’s claim that the president rarely attacks white men, Trump Jr. rattled off 19 of his father’s white-male targets in a single tweet, including former president George W. Bush and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

He often retweets or references far-right voices, as well as websites aimed at conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit, the Federalist and Breitbart News. Earlier this month, he retweeted a comment that the Clintons were “an unscrupulous gang of thugs” and alluded to a fringe-right conspiracy theory alleging that the couple covered up a murder.

In more than 400 tweets last month, he referred to his company only once, retweeting one of its posts offering “thoughts and prayers” after the Las Vegas shooting massacre.

In the coming weeks, Trump Jr. will appear at a $200-a-person fundraiser in Kansas for gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, a torchbearer for the president’s voter-fraud crusade, and keynote a Turning Point USA banquet for thousands of students in West Palm Beach, Fla.

[Donald Trump Jr. headlining fundraiser in Kansas for a leader of his father’s voter fraud commission]

Kirk, the group’s founder, said the event received hundreds of new applications when Trump Jr.’s attendance was announced.

“Part of what makes Don’s brand unique is he’s not afraid to push the envelope, not afraid to push the boundaries and call people out,” Kirk said.

Trump Jr.’s public bravado comes as he faces persistent questions about what multiple Russia probes will reveal about the role he played during his father’s White House run.

Along with the messages he exchanged with WikiLeaks, Trump Jr. met at Trump Tower in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer in hopes of getting damaging information on Clinton. “I love it,” he wrote to an associate about the possibility that the lawyer would have material on the Democratic candidate.

[Donald Trump Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks during 2016 campaign]

Trump Jr. testified privately in September for five hours before a Senate committee and said in a statement that he “did not collude with any foreign government and [does] not know of anyone who did.”

But he faces growing calls by Democratic lawmakers to participate in a public hearing and answer questions about any knowledge he might have about Russia’s effort to boost his father’s campaign.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN in September that she expected Trump Jr. to take part in a hearing “come hell or high water.”

Meanwhile, some of Trump Jr.’s friends said he is struggling with a more fundamental frustration: craving more of a connection to the man he called at the Republican National Convention “my mentor, my best friend.”

In February, Trump Jr. told The Post that he had spoken briefly with his father but said “he’s got real stuff he’s got to deal with.” He told the New York Times earlier this year, “I feel ridiculous bothering him.”

“Don barely talks to his father, and they barely see each other,” said one person close to him who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. “It weighs on him. It does. . . . It didn’t really hit him until laying the wreath before inauguration that this is so much bigger than us, and they’re going to have to make sacrifices.”

Amid his angry online missives are nostalgic posts about the president, whom he dressed up as for Halloween. On the anniversary of the election win, Trump Jr. posted photos of the two hugging and what he called his “favorite piece of campaign memorabilia”: an electoral map signed, “Great job! Thanks, Dad.”

In one video, Trump Jr. says he “had the privilege of being able” to fly with his father to the White House. He can be seen in the helicopter window’s reflection as the president walks away.

A lawyer for former national security adviser Michael Flynn informed an attorney for President Trump this week that he can no longer discuss the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, a sign that Flynn may be preparing to cooperate in the probe, people familiar with the investigation said.

The call from Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner to Trump attorney John Dowd came Wednesday evening and is a potentially ominous sign for Trump and his close associates. Before this week, Kelner had been communicating with lawyers for Trump.

The split suggests that Flynn, who has been a top target of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his team, may be looking to share information with the prosecutor and his team.

The development was first reported by the New York Times.

Kelner did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.

View Graphic Team Trump’s ties to Russian interests

Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, said, “This is not entirely unexpected.”

“No one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president,” he said, adding, “It’s important to remember that General Flynn received his security clearance under the previous administration.”

In complex investigations, lawyers for subjects often enter into agreements that allow them to share information without waiving attorney-client privilege. Such agreements generally include provisions that require the lawyers to immediately end the arrangement if their clients begin discussions with prosecutors or if other developments pose a conflict of interest.

Even if Flynn has begun discussions with Mueller’s office, there is no guarantee he will ultimately reach a deal with prosecutors.

Flynn served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama before he was pushed out in 2014 amid criticism of his management style and clashes with other administration officials.

He then established a private consulting firm and gave paid speeches, work that has drawn intense scrutiny from Mueller.

In December 2015, Flynn was paid by the Russian-government-funded television network RT to attend a dinner in Moscow, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin.

Even as he became an adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign, his consulting firm was paid to promote the interests of the Turkish government. Flynn initially failed to report his payments from either engagement.

Flynn served 24 days as Trump’s national security adviser, but was forced to resign after acknowledging that he had secretly discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during Trump’s presidential transition in December.

Lawyers for the president and senior White House aides had been quietly speculating over the last few weeks that Flynn was under increasing pressure to cooperate because Mueller had signaled his ability to charge his son alongside the father.

Michael G. Flynn, the retired general’s son, helped his father with business arrangements and served as chief of staff at his father’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group.

Barry Coburn, an attorney for Michael G. Flynn, declined to comment.

Officials in nearly a dozen states are preparing to notify families that a crucial health insurance program for low-income children is running out of money for the first time since its creation two decades ago, putting coverage for many at risk by the end of the year.

Congress missed a Sept. 30 deadline to extend funding for CHIP, as the Children’s Health Insurance Program is known. Nearly 9 million youngsters and 370,000 pregnant women nationwide receive care because of it.

Many states have enough money to keep their individual programs afloat for at least a few months, but five could run out in late December if lawmakers do not act. Others will start to exhaust resources the following month.

The looming crunch, which comes despite CHIP’s enduring popularity and bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, has dismayed children’s health advocates.

“We are very concerned, and the reason is that Congress hasn’t shown a strong ability to get stuff done,” said Bruce Lesley, president of Washington-based First Focus, a child and family advocacy organization. “And the administration is completely out, has not even uttered a syllable on the issue. How this gets resolved is really unclear, and states are beginning to hit deadlines.”

Others paying close attention to the issue remain hopeful that Congress will extend funding before January, but states say they cannot rest on hope.

“Everybody is still waiting and thinking Congress is going to act, and they probably will, but you can’t run a health-care program that way,” said Linda Nablo, chief deputy director at Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services. “You can’t say ‘probably’ everything is going to be all right.”

Most CHIP families, who earn too much for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance, are not aware lawmakers’ inaction is endangering coverage. They’re about to find out, though. Virginia and several other states are preparing letters to go out as early as Monday warning families their children’s insurance may be taken away.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the program at the federal level, issued a notice to state health officials on Nov. 9 detailing their options if CHIP funding does run dry. States forced to end the program will need to determine whether enrolled children are eligible for Medicaid or whether their family will need to seek insurance through an Affordable Care Act marketplace, the guidance said.

Longtime physician William Rees remembers the years before CHIP’s safety net, when families without coverage would put off bringing a sick child to the doctor until symptoms were so severe they would end up in a hospital emergency room.

“Pediatrics is mostly preventive medicine, it’s so important what we do,” said Rees, who has practiced in Northern Virginia since 1975. “It’s about trying to keep up with routine visits. If [children] don’t have insurance, that often doesn’t happen, so CHIP keeps them in the system and they get their vaccines when they’re due.”

The program, which is credited with helping to bring the rate of uninsured children to a record low of 4.5 percent, has been reauthorized several times over the years. And under the ACA, the federal government sharply boosted its match rate. It now provides 88 percent or more of every state’s CHIP costs.

Congress has been unable to agree on how to pay for the $15 billion program moving forward, however. President Trump’s 2018 budget proposed to cut billions from CHIP over two years and limit eligibility for federal matching funds.

The uncertainty has states scrambling. Arizona, California, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon and the District of Columbia will run out of CHIP money by Dec. 31 or early January, according to Georgetown University’s Center on Children and Families. At least six more plan to take some sort of action to address the potential funding loss, including notifying parents their children are at risk of losing coverage.

Some states operate CHIP as an independent program and would have to shut theirs down if federal dollars dry up. In Virginia, resources are expected to be exhausted by late January. Nablo said she has no choice but to send notices Dec. 1 to the families of the 66,000 children and 1,100 pregnant women in the state who are covered.

“We don’t want to act too fast if Congress is going to restore this, but we also want to give families enough time,” she said. “We have kids in the middle of cancer treatment, pregnant women in the middle of prenatal care.”

Texas plans to notify families in January that the program could end. Funding problems there were exacerbated by Hurricane Harvey because the state asked the federal government that it be allowed to waive co-pays and enrollment fees for CHIP children in counties declared disaster areas. With less money coming in, funds could be exhausted even sooner than the state first projected, according to Christine Mann, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

In West Virginia, where CHIP funds are expected to run out in March, officials overseeing the program voted this month to shut it down Feb. 28 if Congress hasn’t acted.

Other states, including Maryland, developed their CHIP program as an extension of Medicaid and so are required by law to find a way to keep it going. The same applies to the District, which will need to come up with as much as $12.5 million in local funds to cover the approximately 14,000 children enrolled, the D.C. Department of Health Care Finance said. The agency will begin looking next month at where money can be diverted.

“It’s pretty chaotic out there,” said Joan Alker, executive director at the Georgetown center. “What really troubles me about it is [CHIP] is successful. Everyone should feel good about it. There’s no reason for this to be lagging on like this. This should be an easy win for Congress.”

CHIP has become a political issue in the gubernatorial race in Maryland, where funding would run out in March. Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has pressed for Congress to pass a reauthorization. A potential Democratic opponent, Ben Jealous, has criticized him for not having a backup plan to protect the 140,000 children who would be left uninsured.

In Washington, lawmakers in both parties agree on the program’s merits but are at an impasse over how to pay for it. The House passed a bill this month along largely party lines to extend CHIP funding for five years in part by cutting an ACA prevention fund and raising Medicare rates for wealthier seniors.

That measure is unlikely to be taken up by the other chamber. Senators, led by Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), are working to find a bipartisan solution. Hatch was one of the authors of the original CHIP legislation in 1997. The other was Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who died in 2009.

“I am working with my colleagues to advance this bill in a fiscally responsible manner so we can ensure coverage is maintained,” Hatch said in a recent statement. Yet during a heated exchange last week in a committee meeting on the GOP tax overhaul, he voiced little urgency.

Back up your concern for the poor by starting with an extension for CHIP, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) told Hatch.

Hatch responded angrily, “I’m not starting with CHIP.”

Andy Slavitt, who was acting CMS administrator under President Barack Obama, can’t believe there is anything to debate. That Congress would hold up popular legislation that has never before been subject to politics speaks to the “very fragmented culture of lawmaking,” he said.

“It’s a core program that many low-income families rely on. It’s widely acclaimed to be a success,” he said. “We’re operating in a mode that we don’t do anything until it’s an absolute crisis, and we’re creating more crises that don’t need to happen.”

When Congress failed to extend funding in late September, CMS was able to provide several states and U.S. territories with emergency money to keep their programs going a bit longer. The agency has used about $542 million in leftover funds from previous years, but it has limited resources to assist much longer.

As families hear that their children could lose health insurance, they’re shaken. Marbell Castillo learned about the possibility during a recent checkup with her granddaughter Maia Powell at Burke Pediatrics in Fairfax County, Va.

The appointment, in an exam room decorated with “Toy Story” and “Finding Nemo” decals, covered the gamut. A nurse practitioner asked about what the 16-month-old was eating and when she slept. Maia got her height, weight and temperature taken. She also got her chubby thighs stuck once, twice, three times with vaccinations for diphtheria and other illnesses.

Castillo walked out with Maia balanced on one hip and worries on her mind. She often takes the little girl to appointments so her 23-year-old daughter, who works two jobs, doesn’t have to take off.

Without CHIP, Castillo wondered, what would they do for affordable health insurance for Maia?

“They can’t leave people without this program,” she said.

"Caitlin Dewey, Caitlin Dewey","This generation of farmers is more likely to grow organically and be involved in the local food system, a survey finds.",2017-11-23T07:12:00Z,the-washington-post,A growing number of young Americans are leaving desk jobs to farm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-growing-number-of-young-americans-are-leaving-desk-jobs-to-farm/2017/11/23/e3c018ae-c64e-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/23/Local/Images/youngfarmers07.jpg?t=20170517,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"

Liz Whitehurst dabbled in several careers before she ended up here, crating fistfuls of fresh-cut arugula in the early-November chill.

The hours were better at her nonprofit jobs. So were the benefits. But two years ago, the 32-year-old Whitehurst — who graduated from a liberal arts college and grew up in the Chicago suburbs — abandoned Washington for this three-acre farm in Upper Marlboro, Md.

She joined a growing movement of highly educated, ex-urban, first-time farmers who are capitalizing on booming consumer demand for local and sustainable foods and who, experts say, could have a broad impact on the food system.

For only the second time in the last century, the number of farmers under 35 years old is increasing, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s latest Census of Agriculture. Sixty-nine percent of the surveyed young farmers had college degrees — significantly higher than the general population.

This new generation can’t hope to replace the numbers that farming is losing to age. But it is already contributing to the growth of the local-food movement and could help preserve the place of midsize farms in the rural landscape.

“We’re going to see a sea change in American agriculture as the next generation gets on the land,” said Kathleen Merrigan, the head of the Food Institute at George Washington University and a deputy secretary at the Department of Agriculture under President Barack Obama. “The only question is whether they’ll get on the land, given the challenges.”

The number of farmers age 25 to 34 grew 2.2 percent between 2007 and 2012, according to the 2014 USDA census, a period when other groups of farmers — save the oldest — shrunk by double digits. In some states, such as California, Nebraska and South Dakota, the number of beginning farmers has grown by 20 percent or more.

A survey conducted by the National Young Farmers Coalition, an advocacy group, with Merrigan’s help shows that the majority of young farmers did not grow up in agricultural families.

They are also far more likely than the general farming population to grow organically, limit pesticide and fertilizer use, diversify their crops or animals, and be deeply involved in their local food systems via community supported agriculture (CSA) programs and farmers markets.

Today’s young farmers also tend to operate small farms of less than 50 acres, though that number increases with each successive year of experience.

Whitehurst bought her farm, Owl’s Nest, from a retiring farmer in 2015.

The farm sits at the end of a gravel road, a series of vegetable fields unfurling from a steep hill capped by her tiny white house. Like the farmer who worked this land before her, she leases the house and the fields from a neighboring couple in their 70s.

She grows organically certified peppers, cabbages, tomatoes and salad greens from baby kale to arugula, rotating her fields to enrich the soil and planting cover crops in the offseason.

On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, she and two longtime friends from Washington wake up in semidarkness to harvest by hand, kneeling in the mud to cut handfuls of greens before the sun can wilt them. All three young women, who also live on the farm, make their living off the produce Whitehurst sells, whether to restaurants, through CSA shares or at a D.C. farmers market.

Finances can be tight. The women admit they’ve given up higher standards of living to farm.

“I wanted to have a positive impact, and that just felt very distant in my other jobs out of college,” Whitehurst said. “In farming, on the other hand, you make a difference. Your impact is immediate.”

That impact could grow as young farmers scale up and become a larger part of the commercial food system, Merrigan said.

Already, several national grocery chains, including Walmart and SuperValu, have built out local-food-buying programs, according to AT Kearney, a management consulting firm.

Young farmers are also creating their own “food hubs,” allowing them to store, process and market food collectively, and supply grocery and restaurant chains at a price competitive with national suppliers.

That’s strengthening the local and organic food movement, experts say.

“I get calls all the time from farmers — some of the largest farmers in the country — asking me when the local and organic fads will be over,” said Eve Turow Paul, a consultant who advises farms and food companies on millennial preferences. “It’s my pleasure to tell them: Look at this generation. Get on board or go out of business.”

There are also hopes that the influx of young farmers could provide some counter to the aging of American agriculture.

The age of the average American farmer has crept toward 60 over several decades, risking the security of midsize family farms where children aren’t interested in succeeding their parents.

Between 1992 and 2012, the country lost more than 250,000 midsize and small commercial farms, according to the USDA. During that same period, more than 35,000 very large farms started up, and the large farms already in existence consolidated their acreage.

Midsize farms are critical to rural economies, generating jobs, spending and tax revenue. And while they’re large enough to supply mainstream markets, they’re also small enough to respond to environmental changes and consumer demand.

If today’s young farmers can continue to grow their operations, said Shoshanah Inwood, a rural sociologist at Ohio State University, they could bolster these sorts of farms — and in the process prevent the land from falling into the hands of large-scale industrial operations or residential developers.

“Multigenerational family farms are shrinking. And big farms are getting bigger,” Inwood said. “For the resiliency of the food system and of rural communities, we need more agriculture of the middle.”

It’s too early to say at this point whether young farmers will effect that sort of change.

The number of young farmers entering the field is nowhere near enough to replace the number exiting, according to the USDA: Between 2007 and 2012, agriculture gained 2,384 farmers between ages 25 and 34 — and lost nearly 100,000 between 45 and 54.

And young farmers face formidable challenges to starting and scaling their businesses. The costs of farmland and farm equipment are prohibitive. Young farmers are frequently dependent on government programs, including child-care subsidies and public health insurance, to cover basic needs.

And student loan debt — which 46 percent of young farmers consider a “challenge,” according to the National Young Farmers Coalition — can strain already tight finances and disqualify them from receiving other forms of credit.

But Lindsey Lusher Shute, the executive director of the coalition, said she has seen the first wave of back-to-the-landers grow up in the eight years since she co-founded the advocacy group. And she suggested that new policy initiatives, including student loan forgiveness and farm transition programs, could further help them.

“Young farmers tend to start small and sell to direct markets, because that’s a viable way for them to get into farming,” Lusher Shute said. “But many are shifting gears as they get into it — getting bigger or moving into wholesale.”

Just last year, Whitehurst was approached by an online grocery service that wanted to buy her vegetables. While Owl’s Nest produces too little to supply such a large buyer on its own, the service planned to buy produce from multiple small, local farmers.

Whitehurst ultimately turned the deal down, however. Among other things, she feared that she could not afford to sell her vegetables at the lower price point the service wanted.

“For now, I’m focused on getting better, not bigger,” she said. “But in a few years, who knows. Ask me again then.”

On Friday, October 27, José Andrés and Alice Waters, the world-renowned chefs and food activists, sat down for a joint interview with The Washington Post’s Food Anchor Mary Beth Albright. Waters, the founder of the iconic California restaurant, Chez Panisse, and an early advocate of the organic and farm-to-table food movement, discussed her new memoir, “Coming to My Senses: The Making of a Counterculture Cook.” She also spoke about her decades of advocacy for local, sustainable agriculture and her ongoing work with the Edible Schoolyard Project, which aims to promote an edible education curriculum. She was joined on stage by Andrés, the chef/owner of the 26-restaurant ThinkFoodGroup. Andrés spoke about his work on food and hunger issues as well as his recent disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico with World Central Kitchen. (Washington Post Live)

"Jenna Johnson, Jenna Johnson",Yet the president’s critics were quick to note his holiday victory lap made no mention of his administration’s shortcomings.,2017-11-23T11:18:00Z,the-washington-post,Trump’s Thanksgiving message: ‘The enthusiasm in this country has never been higher’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-thanksgiving-message-the-enthusiasm-in-this-country-has-never-been-higher/2017/11/23/d9b1dedc-d072-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/11/23/National-Politics/Images/Trump_72278-0ded2.jpg?t=20170517,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"President Trump, with first lady Melania Trump, greets and hands out sandwiches on Thanksgiving to members of the Coast Guard at Lake Worth Inlet Station in Riviera Beach, Fla. (Alex Brandon/AP)

On Thanksgiving, President Trump celebrated winning.

Early in the morning, he tweeted a list of wins, including the “highest Stock Market EVER,” a reduced unemployment rate and a new Supreme Court justice. A few hours later, he video-chatted with troops stationed around the world and told them that they are now winning because his administration is allowing them to do their jobs and win.

Trump then traveled to a nearby Coast Guard mess hall to hand out sandwiches and commend the military branch for improving its brand over the past few months. Afterward, he stopped by his private golf club in West Palm Beach.

“Our country is doing great,” Trump said, standing behind an overflowing basket of sandwiches in the mess hall. “You folks are fighting so hard, and working so hard. And it’s nice that you’re working for something that’s really starting to work.”

Critics of the president are quick to note that this holiday victory lap is lacking context and makes no acknowledgment of shortcomings, such as Trump’s historically low approval rating or the Republican Party’s inability so far to make the major legislative changes they promised voters.

During a visit to a Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach, Fla., on Nov. 23, President Trump said “there is no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard” in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. (The Washington Post)

The president’s day started, as most now do, with an early-morning tweet.

“HAPPY THANKSGIVING,” Trump tweeted at 6:28 a.m., “your Country is starting to do really well. Jobs coming back, highest Stock Market EVER, Military getting really strong, we will build the WALL, V.A. taking care of our Vets, great Supreme Court Justice, RECORD CUT IN REGS, lowest unemployment in 17 years . . .!”

Three minutes later, the president responded to a tweet from Greg Sargent, a Washington Post opinion writer, that referenced Trump’s recent criticism of the father of a UCLA basketball player and stated, “Trump regularly attacks high-profile African Americans to feed his supporters’ belief that the system is rigged for minorities.”

“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote. The same message was later sent out on its own.

[Trump replies ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!’ to tweet about his attacks on African Americans]

Nearly three hours later, Trump sat down at a computer screen set up in the lavish living room of Mar-a-Lago, the exclusive club in Palm Beach where he spends many winter weekends. On his screen were troops from the five branches of the military who are spending the holiday in Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait and at sea.

“It’s an honor to speak with you all and to give God thanks for the blessing of freedom,” Trump said, often reading from a piece of paper in his hands.

He told those stationed in Afghanistan that “everybody’s talking about the progress you’ve made in the last few months since I opened it up.”

“We opened it up. We said, ‘Go ahead, we’re going to fight to win,’ ” Trump said. “We’re not fighting anymore to just walk around — we’re fighting to win.”

The same thing is happening in Iraq, he said, as he thanked the service members who are fighting the Islamic State terrorist group.

“We’re really winning,” Trump said. “We know how to win — but we have to let you win. They weren’t letting you win before. They weren’t letting you play even. We’re letting you win.”

Trump acknowledged that it is difficult for these troops to be away from home during the holidays — but he assured them that he is winning while they are gone.

“The economy is doing really great,” Trump said. “When you come back, you’re going to see with the jobs and the companies coming back into our country and the stock market just hit a record high. Unemployment is the lowest it’s been in 17 years. So you’re fighting for something real, you’re fighting for something good.”

The president, along with first lady Melania Trump, then hopped into the motorcade and traveled to Coast Guard Station Lake Worth Inlet in Riviera Beach, Fla. The Trumps purchased lunch for those working on Thanksgiving and briefly addressed dozens of Coast Guard members.

“It is an honor to be here,” the president said. “The Coast Guard — always respected — but if you were looking at it as a brand, there’s no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard” in responding to hurricanes that hit Texas, several Gulf Coast states and Puerto Rico.

[The White House almost slashed the Coast Guard’s budget. Now Trump can’t stop praising its brand.]

Trump offered to take questions, but no one spoke up. So he filled the time by telling them about increasing funding for the military and all the new equipment that it’s buying. And he promised that U.S. allies won’t get equipment that is quite as good because “even if they’re allies, you never know about an ally; an ally can turn.”

It was then time for the president to hand out sandwiches — and shake hands with the Coast Guard members. He joked about arm wrestling one of them and then remarked, “Such good shape, what’s going on here?”

Soon, the president was back on the road, this time to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, where he spent about four hours. He then returned to Mar-a-Lago for dinner with his family and some friends. The menu included turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows, a variety of baked goods, local produce and cheeses, red snapper, and Florida stone crab, along with various cakes and pies for dessert.

In honor of the holiday, the president also released a video address in which he retold the story of Thanksgiving, thanked those who responded to disasters this year and, again, recounted the wins.

“Our country is doing very well,” Trump said. “We are doing something very special. People are feeling it. The enthusiasm in this country has never been higher. We’re very, very happy on this Thanksgiving Day.”

FIRED/REHIRED : In this series, The Washington Post explores how police chiefs are often forced to put hundreds of officers fired for misconduct back on the streets.

In 2013, homicide detectives in Miami were finally closing in on suspects in the robbery and killing of a manager at a cellphone store six years earlier. A break in the case had led them to a colleague: police officer Adrian Rodriguez.

Rodriguez had been employed at the cellphone store before joining the Miami Police Department and was working there the night the manager was ambushed and shot to death. Investigators had come to suspect that the crime was an inside job, possibly involving Rodriguez, his brother and his father.

When Rodriguez refused to cooperate with detectives, the police chief fired him. Rodriguez then did what many other South Florida police officers have done to get their jobs back — he turned to Fort Lauderdale labor attorney Gene Gibbons.

Gibbons, who represents officers in job appeals on behalf of police unions across Florida, has over the past eight years won reinstatement for more than 22 fired officers, often returning them to work over the objections of police chiefs who say they are unfit for duty.

A former cop, Gibbons has prevailed by finding the weak point in a department’s case, no matter how severe the alleged misconduct. He frequently capitalizes on the mistakes of police officials, attacking sloppy investigations and hammering departments over missed deadlines.

“The city gives me ammunition to win,” Gibbons, 47, said of his strategy.

In May, Gibbons won again — persuading an arbitrator to order Rodriguez’s return to the Miami police force.

“He’s not fit to be a cop,” said Miami Police Chief Rodolfo Llanes of Rodriguez. “How could we face the victim’s family if we didn’t fire him?”

Llanes claims Gibbons’s success is undermining his effort to hold his officers accountable. Gibbons’s efforts have forced Miami to reinstate six of the 12 officers the chief has fired since 2014.

The work of labor lawyers like Gibbons helps explain why hundreds of officers nationwide have won back jobs through a quasi-judicial process known as arbitration. In August, The Post reported that since 2006 police chiefs at 37 of the nation’s largest police departments have been forced to rehire more than 450 officers, or nearly a quarter of the officers they have fired for misconduct. Often the officers conceded some aspect of the underlying misconduct, but arbitrators, swayed by union attorneys, overruled the firings.

For Gibbons, an affable, barrel-chested man, the path to becoming an advocate for embattled police officers began when he was a teen growing up outside Philadelphia in the early 1980s.

Then 16, Gibbons was driving home in the family station wagon when a Philadelphia police officer pulled him over. Gibbons sat quietly while the officer ran his license. When he returned, the boy asked the officer why he had been stopped. Gibbons said the officer abruptly punched him in the face and told him to go home.

“I was stewing mad,” he said. “The police had tremendous power.”

Gibbons wanted to be a police officer himself. He studied criminal justice at Lycoming College in Pennsylvania and then moved to Florida to become an officer at the Coral Gables Police Department. When the city threatened to reduce pension benefits for officers, Gibbons ran for president of the Coral Gables officers’ union and won.

“I thought I’d enjoy the fight,” he said.

Eventually, Gibbons realized he could do more to advocate for the rank-and-file officers as an attorney working for the police unions. He obtained a law degree from Florida’s Nova Southeastern University, left the force and started his own firm. He and his partner now represent about 3,200 officers on behalf of nine police unions across Florida.

“Gene Gibbons gave me back my life with his diligent fight,” said Mike Muley, an officer in Miami Beach who was fired after he developed a drinking problem and unholstered his gun in a club. In a job appeal, Gibbons forced Miami Beach to rehire Muley and provide him with treatment.

On occasion, the attorney has won cases against seemingly insurmountable odds. He sent back to work a Miami Beach detective who in 2013 tested positive for cocaine — by arguing that the results came from a home remedy for erectile dysfunction.

Gibbons said it’s important that officers be held accountable, but police chiefs are too quick to fire officers over misconduct. In job appeals, Gibbons tries to show arbitrators that the officers are duty-bound people, humbled by a terrible mistake.

‘I’m on top of you’

In Plantation, the police chief felt that Officer Pete Saglio’s conduct had crossed the line: While at work, Saglio used police department equipment to send a 26-second masturbation video to a woman whose case he was investigating.

The episode began in January 2015 when Saglio, working as a detective, began to look into anonymous flower deliveries to the woman’s home. One of the deliveries included a potentially threatening message.

Saglio reached out to the woman by text to discuss the case. Over the next two months, he sent hundreds of messages, around the clock, some of them salted with suggestive comments, according to copies of the messages, which were among the internal affairs files obtained by The Post in an open records request.

“I’m on top of you,” he wrote in one. Seconds later, he added: “OMG, I meant ‘it.’ ”

He joked in several texts about wearing a tightfitting superhero outfit: “I know secretly you want to see those tights.”

He told her that he was giving her case extra attention.

“I can’t remember ever doing the things I did for you,” he wrote in another text. “For anyone Lol.”

None of the messages explicitly suggested a sexual relationship, but the woman said she felt that Saglio was testing her boundaries.

“The officer was creeping me out with some of his comments,” the woman said in an interview. (The Post’s policy is to not identify victims of sexual assault or abuse.) “He told me I owed him.”

But the woman said she was afraid to confront Saglio or his supervisors about the troubling messages because she did not want to jeopardize the investigation.

That changed on March 3, 2015, when Saglio sent her the video.

“I opened it, and I started screaming, ‘Oh my god. Oh my god. He sent me a video and he’s masturbating!’ ” she recalled. “My friend said, ‘Oh my god, honey, call the police!’ and I said, ‘He is the police.’ ”

Minutes after she received the video, Saglio called her and said he had inadvertently sent something that wasn’t meant for her and not to open it, according to a statement Saglio later gave internal affairs investigators.

The woman immediately called her attorney. He reported it to Plantation city officials and called and told Saglio not to contact the woman further.

Saglio then destroyed the mobile device he used to send the video and told supervisors he had mistakenly sent a video, according to his statement.

Chief W. Howard Harrison fired Saglio in April 2016 after he concluded that the detective violated three department policies, including one that requires officers be of “moral character.”

Saglio appealed, and Gibbons argued in the December 2016 arbitration hearing that firing was too harsh because Saglio meant to send the video to his wife. Florida law, he added, does not specify masturbation as a moral character violation for police officers.

“This case is about something that everybody in this room has done, and I’m not talking about masturbation,” Gibbons said in the hearing. “I’m talking about accidentally sending something on their phone to the wrong recipient.”

Harrison said officers should not be sending pornographic videos at work and that he could no longer rely on Saglio’s judgment as an officer.

“He sent a video of him masturbating, while on duty, using the city WiFi, and you’re going to tell me that’s not a moral character violation?” Harrison said in the hearing.

In March, arbitrator Mark Scarr sided with Gibbons. He reduced the firing to a suspension and ordered that Saglio be demoted and retrained, according to the ruling.

“Had there not been arbitration or some similar process, here is an individual that would have been strung out, without a job, I think unjustly,” Scarr told The Post.

Saglio did not respond to requests for comment. His wife declined an interview.

The department removed Saglio from his detective assignment and returned him to duty as a patrol officer.

“What kind of message does the arbitrator’s decision send?” asked a Plantation police legal adviser, Melissa Zelniker-Presser, in an interview with The Post. “We have to remember that through all of this there is a victim. A very real victim whose life will forever be affected by what Officer Saglio did.”

Patterns of misconduct

In the city of Miami, the officers who have been fired can have long records of misconduct. Many have been returned to work, however, after Gibbons has convinced an arbitrator that a pattern of problems doesn’t justify a firing.

Over the past 12 years, Officer Jean-Marie Jean Phillipe has been reprimanded for alleged misconduct 12 times, including four suspensions, according to police disciplinary records. His offenses have ranged from using his badge to pressure a pawnshop employee for a better deal on a computer to mishandling criminal evidence.

In 2012, Jean Phillipe disobeyed department orders not to drive because his license was suspended. According to police disciplinary records, he has failed to show up for a court appearance twice, failed to come to work on two occasions without explanation and has been involved in two avoidable crashes in his patrol car, records show. He also was disciplined after he was allegedly caught dozing at the front desk of a police station and sleeping in his patrol car behind a warehouse.

In 2015, police said they discovered Jean Phillipe sleeping on his shift a third time. Just after midnight, a patrolman found him in his police cruiser on a quiet road. According to the officer, Jean Phillipe was sleeping so deeply that the officer could not wake him with a police siren. When a supervisor arrived and finally rousted Jean Phillipe, the officer ignored him and drove to the police station, records show.

The police department had had enough and Llanes fired him in August 2015.

“Is he a killer cop? No,” Kevin Jones, assistant city attorney for Miami, who represented the department in the firing, said in an interview. “Is he an incompetent cop? Yes.”

In an interview, Jean Phillipe, 47, generally disputed his disciplinary record and said supervisors have reprimanded him without reason.

“I can tell you, my records show that I’m among the best police officers in Miami,” Jean Phillipe said.

“Am I perfect? No. But I come to work and do exactly what I’m supposed to do. I go out there and do my job with honesty and integrity with great passion for the city of Miami.”

When Jean Phillipe’s firing went to arbitration in November 2016, Gibbons and the officer offered various explanations for the behavior. Jean Phillipe testified that a few sips of an energy drink rendered him semiconscious.

Gibbons also argued that the firing was too harsh. He pointed out that the two instances of misconduct cited by the department to show disciplinary options had been exhausted were under appeal or overturned, including the case when police said he was sleeping in his car behind the warehouse in 2012. (The city’s disciplinary action was recently upheld on appeal.)

In the 2016 case, the arbitrator said he thought the officer’s explanation for his behavior was “contradictory and/or illogical” but agreed with Gibbons’s assertion that the department had gone too far in firing him. In February, the arbitrator ordered Jean Phillipe reinstated, ruling that there was “just cause for a severe disciplinary penalty, namely, a lengthy suspension.”

“It’s difficult to explain to citizens how it’s possible that somebody gets their job back after exhibiting this kind of conduct,” Llanes told The Post.

Jean Phillipe has been returned to patrol.

When he was fired, he said he worried about providing for his family and feared that he would land in poverty, conditions he knew growing up in Haiti.

But he said Gibbons assured him, “Look, Jean, there is a good chance you’re going to get your job back. Just go with the flow.”

“He was right all along.”

A robbery and a homicide

The firing of Adrian Rodriguez dates to Oct. 28, 2007, when he was 20 and working at a Miami cellphone store. He had recently applied to become an officer with the Miami Police Department.

That night, a security camera at a nearby restaurant recorded Rodriguez, store manager Yosbel Millares-Vega and two other employees after they had exited the back of the store into an alley.

Two gunmen suddenly appeared and demanded money, according to witnesses. Millares-Vega, a 27-year-old former Marine who had served in Iraq, threw a bank bag containing about $30,000 to the ground. He was shot anyway. The gunmen then fled down the alley. Millares-Vega later died.

The crime scene offered little evidence aside from two bullet casings.

Detectives interviewed Rodriguez for 10 hours that night at police headquarters, according to Gibbons. He gave a description of the potential suspects, which led to the arrest of two people, who police later determined had no involvement. The investigation stalled.

Rodriguez, meanwhile, was hired by the department in 2009 and eventually assigned to a patrol district.

In 2011, detectives got a break in the case. Someone gave them a recording of a conversation between Rodriguez’s younger brother Brian and a relative, who was in jail.

On the call, Brian told the relative that he knew the relative had been talking to people about something Brian wanted kept quiet, according to a transcript.

“Hey, bro. I had told you something a long time ago, remember?” Brian said.

The relative said he remembered the conversation and had kept it confidential. Brian Rodriguez, however, said two people had told him about details of the conversation.

“I’m not a rat, and I don’t tell on people,” the relative replied.

The call, although cryptic, convinced detectives the men had information about the crime. They interviewed the relative.

He told detectives that Brian Rodriguez had confided to him that Brian’s and Adrian’s father had allegedly planned and carried out the robbery and that Adrian was the inside man, according to an account later given by a homicide detective in a deposition.

The new information seemed to resolve details that had puzzled detectives. The security cameras in the store had been disabled that night, and a few minutes before the robbery, Rodriguez moved his car and parked it behind the manager’s, blocking his exit.

“The source/sources and evidence also gave Homicide investigators reason to suspect that other members of Adrian Rodriguez’ family could be involved and, therefore, were persons of interest in the investigation,” according to the later reprimand of Adrian Rodriguez.

In 2013, they brought the officer in for another interview.

“During the interview, Homicide detectives notified Officer Rodriguez that his father, Norberto Rodriguez, was potentially a person of interest in the case,” the reprimand noted. Police said Rodriguez refused to talk about the case and left the interview.

“Officer Rodriguez’ unwillingness to provide information via a witness interview shows his unwillingness to cooperate with investigators, and ensures that he remains a suspect in the case,” the reprimand said.

The department placed Rodriguez on paid leave and ordered him to stay at home and check in twice a day with supervisors.

When confronted by detectives, Brian Rodriguez denied that it was his voice on the jailhouse recording. He was charged with felony perjury and eventually struck a deal to defer the prosecution if he admitted to the recording. The father has not been charged in the robbery or homicide.

“This is crazy they are going after my family like that,” Rodriguez’s father, Norberto, said in a phone call with The Post. Asked if he was involved, he said, “This conversation is over.”

In April 2016, Llanes, the Miami police chief, fired Rodriguez.

The officer had attended three of his brother’s court hearings, unaware that internal affairs investigators were watching him. Llanes claimed that by going to the court hearings without permission and on city time, he was stealing pay, and by refusing to help with the investigation, he was violating his oath as an officer.

“The times that Adrian lied about his whereabouts was to meet with the people who we think are responsible for this crime,” Llanes alleged in an interview with The Post. “It wasn’t like he took a sick day to go to the beach.”

Rodriguez appealed and the union brought in Gibbons.

During the February hearing, Rodriguez declined to answer most questions on Fifth Amendment grounds. Gibbons said Rodriguez had nothing to do with the robbery and had been charged with no crime. The lawyer said the department wrongly fired the officer to counter the intense publicity the case had drawn. Gibbons said he could not be fired for refusing to cooperate.

“It can’t get any clearer than that they fired the man because he exercised his constitutional right,” Gibbons said in an interview.

In May, arbitrator Donald J. Spero, a former labor lawyer for Sears, ruled that the department must reinstate Rodriguez.

Spero declined to discuss the details of the case but said he stands by his decision. “You have someone’s life in your hands. You have to give each party what’s due,” he said.

The city is appealing the decision to a state circuit court and has not returned Rodriguez to patrol.

Rodriguez, through Gibbons, declined to comment. The Post could not reach his brother Brian Rodriguez for comment.

If the department loses, Llanes said, “I would relieve him of duty again and send him home, so the taxpayers could be looking at paying his salary for 20 years.”

The killing remains unsolved.

Forty-four sailors were aboard. (Argentine Navy)

Argentina is continuing its search for a submarine that has been missing for nine days as relatives of the missing sailors fear the worst.

In the clearest sign of what may have happened to the ARA San Juan, which vanished a week ago off the coast of Patagonia, officials said a sound detected near the last known location of the submarine carrying 44 crew members is believed to have come from an explosion.

Enrique Balbi, spokesman for the Argentine navy, told reporters at a news conference Thursday that officials have found evidence showing that the abnormal sound, which was detected 30 miles north of the submarine's last-known location, was “singular, short, violent and non-nuclear” and “consistent with an explosion,” the Associated Press reported.

Balbi also said that officials do not know what caused the suspected explosion and that there is no evidence the vessel was attacked.

If the vessel remained intact, its crew would have only enough oxygen to survive submerged for a little more than a week. The submarine was supposed to arrive Monday at the Mar del Plata naval base, about 250 miles southeast of Buenos Aires.

“At this point, the truth is I have no hope that they will come back,” Maria Villareal, mother of one crew member, told local television on Friday morning, according to Reuters.

Itati Leguizamon, whose husband is among the missing, told reporters, “They did not tell us they were dead, but that is the logical conclusion.”

The United States, Britain, Brazil and Chile have sent teams of searchers to try to locate the vessel. The U.S. Navy has put more advanced resources into the Atlantic Ocean, including two unmanned underwater vehicles that use side-scan sonar to create images of large areas of the seafloor.

But the search has been stymied by 20-foot waves and winds near 50 mph, according to NPR.

Balbi told reporters Thursday that six teams were continuing to look for the missing submarine near the San Jorge Gulf, about 270 miles from the Argentine coast, CNN reported.

Earlier, officials were working to determine whether phone calls recorded from the area near the San Juan's last known location may have come from the vessel, the New York Times reported. But the Argentine defense minister later said the calls did not come from the submarine.

Argentine officials first learned about the noise Wednesday, Balbi told reporters. Argentine navy ships and aircraft from the United States and Brazil were then sent to check out the sound.

The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, based in Vienna, also said Thursday that two of its hydroacoustic stations detected an “unusual signal” near the submarine's last known location.

[Hope dwindles for families of lost Argentina submarine crew]

The signal was detected at 1:51 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (8:51 a.m. Eastern) on Nov. 15, when Argentine officials lost contact with the San Juan, the organization said.

Hydroacoustic stations are part of the organization's monitoring system that keeps track of signs of nuclear explosions around the globe.

The news of a possible explosion drove some family members at the base to tears, according to the AP. Photos show relatives of crew members hugging and consoling each other. Some can be seen collapsing to the ground.

Others responded with anger.

“They sent a piece of crap to sail,” Leguizamon, the wife of submarine crew member German Suarez, told the AP. “They inaugurated a submarine with a coat of paint and a flag in 2014, but without any equipment inside. The navy is to blame for its 15 years of abandonment.”

The German-built diesel-electric submarine joined the Argentine navy fleet in 1985 and was upgraded a few years ago.

Awards season wouldn’t be complete without the requisite number of controversies, and it got an early one last week when Universal announced it would submit the thriller “Get Out” for a Golden Globe in the comedy category.

The film’s writer-director, Jordan Peele, immediately communicated his disappointment, tweeting, “‘Get Out’ is a documentary.” Although he later moderated his reaction, he maintained that to categorize his directorial debut as a comedy is to fatally misunderstand the seriousness of the movie, in which a young African American man is existentially threatened by a Stepford-like liberal white family in the suburbs.

“The reason for the visceral response to this movie being called a comedy is that we are still living in a time in which African American cries for justice aren’t being taken seriously,” Peele explained in a statement. “It’s important to acknowledge that though there are funny moments, the systemic racism that the movie is about is very real. More than anything, it shows me that film can be a force for change. At the end of the day, call ‘Get Out’ horror, comedy, drama, action or documentary, I don’t care. Whatever you call it, just know it’s our truth.”

Back in February, when “Get Out” was released, Peele seemed more willing to embrace the satirical elements of a film in which, for every jump scare, there’s a wickedly observant laugh. Press notes for the film explained that he approached the screenplay as a mash-up of “humor, satire and horror,” the better to “tackle the current state of race relations in America.” Peele himself explained that his idea “came from my wanting to contribute something to the genres of thriller and horror that was unique to my voice. The fact that it goes to race goes to the area I’ve worked in a lot, which is comedy.”

Not only should Peele feel proud of “Get Out” as a stinging, socially aware satire, but should his movie be nominated for a Golden Globe, he’ll likely be in similarly strong company. In fact, 2017 has been a remarkable year for comedy, a genre that is reliable when it comes to box office but habitually stigmatized when it’s time to confer prestige by way of awards. Not only did “Girls Trip” help save an otherwise moribund summer, but such lighthearted films as “The Big Sick,” “Lady Bird” and even “Thor: Ragnarok” have proved to be hugely popular with viewers.

Lighthearted, but not lightweight: Like “Get Out,” this year’s comedies have shown themselves to be exceptionally elastic vectors for serious content.

Martin McDonagh’s “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” is full of the filmmaker’s signature lacerating humor, even as it addresses racism, criminal justice and accountability. “Battle of the Sexes,” Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris’s movie about Billie Jean King’s era-defining tennis match against Bobby Riggs, revisits the infuriating indignities of 1970s sexism, albeit with lots of amusing, sprightly set pieces. Equally timely in a year of rolling harassment and abuse accusations was “Colossal,” a quirky homage to Japanese creature features starring Anne Hathaway as an aimless millennial who becomes a gaslighting victim (until reclaiming her power in a triumphantly fantastical climax). Even Darren Aronofsky, whose movie “Mother!” was a polemic about ecological destruction, auteurism, biblical allegory, misogyny or all of the above, admitted recently that the outrageous physical action of the film owes at least a partial debt to the Marx brothers.

Peele might be disappointed that “Get Out” is being considered a comedy because, historically, the genre gets unjustly short shrift at the Oscars, such master practitioners as Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick, Elaine May and James L. Brooks notwithstanding. We’re long past due for that snobbery to come to an end, especially when those filmmakers’ temperamental heirs have emerged with such assurance, originality and verve. (And there are more on the way: Two upcoming films, Alexander Payne’s speculative adventure “Downsizing” and “I, Tonya,” about the figure skater Tonya Harding, manage to address loss, self-sacrifice, pain and abuse through lenses that are alternately playful and reflective.)

Whether satirical or sincere, the cardinal strength of these films hasn’t been their nonstop yuks but rather sophisticated, sometimes risky, tonal complexities that are the mark of movies willing to be more than just one thing. Far more effective than pretentious problem pictures or strident social commentaries, these are the films that feel most alert to and engaged with their social environment, capturing what it feels like to be alive in America right this minute — when it hurts to laugh but does no good to cry.","billy wilder stanley kubrick elaine may

During the three months that Burma has been rocked by a refugee exodus the United States has now deemed “ethnic cleansing,” de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi for the most part has remained hunkered down in her office in this capital city, hewed out of the jungle just over a decade ago by the military regime.

Witnesses have alleged that the military and Buddhist mobs raped women, executed civilians and burned more than 200 villages in a crackdown that followed an attack by Rohingya extremists Aug. 25, causing more than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya to flee into neighboring Bangladesh.

But in interviews here, officials and party leaders close to her not only deny the magnitude of the crisis but that civilian killings and other atrocities took place at all. This, Western observers say, could complicate the staggering task before them — carrying out a deal struck Thursday with Bangladesh to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees, many of them terrified to return to an area where they have clashed violently with their Buddhist neighbors.

On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who visited Burma and met with Suu Kyi and its top general Nov. 15, strongly denounced the “abuses” of the Burmese security forces and local mobs as “ethnic cleansing.” Burma also is known as Myanmar.

On. Nov. 22, the State Department labeled violence in Burma “ethnic cleansing,” after more than 600,000 Rohingya from Rakhine State fled to Bangladesh. (The Washington Post)

“No provocation can justify the horrendous atrocities that have ensued,” Tillerson said in a statement. “These abuses by some among the Burmese military, security forces, and local vigilantes have caused tremendous suffering. . . . It is clear that the situation in northern Rakhine state constitutes ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.”

Suu Kyi’s spokesman said in response that Tillerson’s statement “failed to mention” the killings of Hindus and other “innocent civilians” by Rohingya militants and that conclusions were made “without any proven facts.”

The government has repeatedly asked the United States to support its assertions and has not received any “meaningful” help in response, said Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Suu Kyi’s office. However, he added, the government will work to try to find a “durable solution” to the problem.

In recent days, Suu Kyi’s advisers have denied any atrocities occurred.

“We’ve seen some Muslim people leaving to Bangladesh, and I believe that the main reason they were leaving is because they were afraid to be killed by extremists,” said Win Myat Aye, Burma’s minister of social welfare, relief and resettlement. “The Tatmadaw [Burmese military] did not attack innocent villagers.”

The United Nations special rapporteur for human rights in Burma, Yanghee Lee, says she finds Suu Kyi’s position “worrying.”

“It’s one thing for the military to exonerate itself, but when the civilian government denies all this, Myanmar will never know what happened,” she said. “She owes it to all the people, they know the truth.”

In the weeks since the crisis began, Suu Kyi, 72, has gone about her official duties as Burma’s leader with doggedness, seemingly impervious to any threat to her legacy as a Nobel Peace Prize winner once compared to Mohandas Gandhi and the Dalai Lama.

She has been widely condemned for not using her moral authority to speak out on the Rohingya’s plight, and she has been stripped of honors and awards by the international community, which once lionized her. Most recently, the musician and humanitarian Bob Geldof called her “a handmaiden to genocide.”

[Analysis: The shameful silence of Aung San Suu Kyi]

When she has ventured out — this month helicoptering to the site of the violence in Rakhine state for the first time, for example — she has seemed woefully, or willfully, out of touch, gently chiding both sides not to “quarrel” with each other.

In September, in her first major speech on the crisis, she asserted that military clearance operations had ceased even as smoke from burning villages was still visible in the sky at the Bangladeshi border.

“She has fairly limited sources of information,” said analyst Richard Horsey, stating also that her government is in crisis mode. “They were blindsided by the severity of this and the speed at which it has moved.”

Suu Kyi has regular daily contact with just a handful of advisers — from her National League for Democracy party and a few foreigners. Her relationship with Burma’s generals remains frosty.

“Even her party leadership cannot approach her easily, so she’s a little bit isolated,” said Nyo Nyo Thinn, a former politician who now heads a civil society group. Suu Kyi and her party leaders often complain with exasperation that there are many more problems in Burma that need fixing than just the Muslim refugees, Nyo Nyo Thinn said.

Suu Kyi, who spent 15 years under house arrest under Burma’s military regime, has been long embraced by Washington politicians on both sides of the aisle, including Hillary Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who even today consider her Burma’s best hope for democracy.

But recent events have strained the goodwill. A bipartisan group of senators led by John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) have sponsored legislation calling for renewed sanctions against Burma’s military in the wake of the violence, and a similar effort is underway in the House.

[Washington begins to sour on Aung San Suu Kyi amid ethnic violence]

While McConnell and others still support her publicly, others have been disillusioned by what they see as her callous indifference to the plight of the stateless Rohingya.

“I sense a very distinct lack of empathy for anybody,” said one Obama administration official who spent time with her and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. “I found myself wondering whether all those years of separation from her family and the loss of her husband had an impact on her.”

Suu Kyi’s husband, Michael Aris, was fighting prostate cancer and denied a visa while she was under house arrest; she refused to return to Britain for fear the military would not allow her back into Burma. Aris died in 1999 without being able to say goodbye.

Many of her critics have alleged she shares the view of much of her core constituency in Buddhist-majority Burma who consider the Rohingya, who have lived in the country for centuries, to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

“This is the first moment in the last 50 years that everyone without exception in Myanmar is united,” Horsey said. “The military, civilian leaders and the vast majority of the population are all on the same page on this. This isn’t about ethnic cleansing. It’s about, ‘We don’t trust these people. They’re not registered, and they should go back to Bangladesh.’ ”

There were scant details available about the agreement Burma and Bangladesh reached Thursday for the return of the Rohingya. Before the accord was announced, many expressed doubts about returning refugees to Burma.

“Who will be overseeing the return? The security forces that drove them out?” asked Lee, the U.N. human rights rapporteur. There is a danger that they may end up in permanent detention camps rather than returning to their own homes, she said.

But Suu Kyi remains popular in her home country. When Oxford removed her portrait in September and placed it in storage, dozens of copies of the Chen Yanning painting — of a young Suu Kyi with red flowers in her hair — flooded the streets in Burma.

“People really support Aung San Suu Kyi. She suffered a lot. She was arrested in her house for more than a decade — the military repressed her, and she could not see her family. So we feel very sympathetic to her,” Nyo Nyo Thinn said. “Whatever she does, we can forgive her.”

Eric Tucker / AP,,2017-11-24T02:15:27Z,time,Michael Flynn's Lawyers Reportedly End Communications With President Trump's Team,http://time.com/5036211/michael-flynn-donald-trump-lawyers-break-russia-probe/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/635036616.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"(WASHINGTON) — Lawyers for former national security adviser Michael Flynn have told President Donald Trump’s legal team that they are no longer communicating with them about special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference.

The decision could be a sign that Flynn is moving to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation or negotiate a deal for himself. Flynn’s legal team communicated the decision this week, said a person familiar with the move who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.

In large criminal investigations, defense lawyers routinely share information with each other. But it can become unethical to continue such communication if one of the potential targets is looking to negotiate a deal with prosecutors. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday. A lawyer for Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., who has also come under investigation from Mueller’s team of prosecutors, declined to comment.

The New York Times first reported the decision.

Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser in February after White House officials concluded that he had misled them about the nature of his contacts during the transition period with the Russian ambassador to the United States.

He was interviewed by the FBI in January about his communications with the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. The deputy attorney general at the time, Sally Yates, soon advised White House officials that their public assertions that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak were incorrect and that Flynn was therefore in a compromised position.

Flynn was facing a Justice Department investigation over his foreign business dealings even before Mueller was appointed as special counsel in May to investigate potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Mueller has since inherited that investigation.

Flynn, a prominent Trump backer on the campaign trail, has been a key figure in Mueller’s probe and of particular interest to Trump. Former FBI Director James Comey, for instance, said that Trump encouraged him to end an FBI investigation into Flynn during a private Oval Office meeting in February.

In addition to scrutinizing Flynn’s contacts with Russia during the transition and campaign, Mueller has been investigating the retired U.S. Army lieutenant general’s role in $530,000 worth of lobbying work his now-defunct firm performed for a Turkish businessman during the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign.

The lobbying campaign sought to gather derogatory information on Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric and green-card holder living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Gulen of being behind a botched coup and has sought his extradition. Gulen has denied the allegations, and U.S. officials have rebuffed Turkey’s extradition demands, citing a lack of evidence.

Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, carried out the lobbying and research work for several months, meeting with officials from the U.S. and Turkish governments. Flynn also published an op-ed on Election Day in The Hill newspaper, parroting many of the Turkish government’s talking points about Gulen. At the time, neither Flynn nor his company was registered with the Justice Department to represent Turkish interests.

Soon after the publication of the op-ed, the Justice Department began investigating Flynn’s lobbying work, and in March, he registered with the department as a foreign agent. In federal filings, Flynn acknowledged the work could have benefited the government of Turkey.

Since then, FBI agents working for Mueller have been investigating whether the Turkish government was directing the lobbying work and not a private company owned by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin, as Flynn’s firm has contended. FBI agents have also been asking about Flynn’s business partner, Bijan Kian, who served on Trump’s presidential transition, and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., who worked for his father as part of the lobbying campaign. Flynn Jr. also was a near constant presence around his father during the Trump campaign and presidential transition period.

Mueller announced his first charges in the investigation last month, including the guilty plea of a foreign-policy adviser to the campaign, George Papadopoulos, and the indictments of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates.

He thanked troops for “having the tremendous courage to defend us and to defend freedom.”

Addressing troops stationed in Afghanistan, the President said: “Everybody’s talking about the progress you’ve made in the last few months since I opened it up,” referencing his decision earlier this year to send up to 4,000 more trips to the country — going against his campaign promise to scale back foreign commitments.

“We opened it up, we said, ‘Go ahead, we’re going to fight to win. We’re not fighting anymore to just walk around, we’re fighting to win.’ And you people, you’ve really turned it around in the past three to four months like nobody’s seen and they are talking about it. So thank you very much, brave, incredible fighters.”

Trump’s video message to American troops followed a tweet earlier Thanksgiving morning where he touted his administration’s accomplishments since he was elected.

“HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well,” he tweeted. “Jobs coming back, highest Stock Market EVER, Military getting really strong, we will build the WALL, V.A. taking care of our Vets, great Supreme Court Justice, RECORD CUT IN REGS, lowest unemployment in 17 years….!”

Back in Mar a Lago, Trump reiterated his message to the troops, who were connected to him via teleconference. “We’re being talked about as an armed forces. We’re really winning. We know how to win,” Trump said. “But we have to let you win. They weren’t letting you win before. They were letting you play even. We’re letting you win.”

He also mentioned the ongoing war against terrorism, specifically messaging ISIS. The self-declared Caliphate has been pushed out of most of its key strongholds in Syria recently, though much of the fighting has been done by Kurdish forces and Syrian government forces, with Russian assistance.

“The fight against ISIS, it’s coming our way. Coming our way. Big, big difference. A lot of things have happened. They say we’ve made more progress against ISIS than they did in years of the previous administration. That’s because I’m letting you do your job.”","thanksgiving

Almudena Calatrava and Luis Andres Henao / AP,,2017-11-24T02:07:45Z,time,An 'Explosion' Was Detected Near the Missing Argentine Sub's Last Known Location,http://time.com/5036196/missing-argentine-sub-explosion/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-877971370.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"(MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina) — An apparent explosion occurred near the time and place an Argentine submarine went missing, the country’s navy reported Thursday, prompting relatives of the vessel’s 44 crew members to burst into tears and some to say they had lost hope of a rescue.

Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said the search will continue until there is full certainty about the fate of the ARA San Juan, despite the evidence of an explosion and with more than a week having passed since the submarine disappeared. It was originally scheduled to arrive Monday at Argentina’s Mar del Plata Navy Base.

The U.S. Navy and an international nuclear test-ban monitoring organization said a “hydro-acoustic anomaly” was produced just hours after the navy lost contact with the sub on Nov. 15. It was near the submarine’s last known location.

“According to this report, there was an explosion,” Balbi told reporters. “We don’t know what caused an explosion of these characteristics at this site on this date.”

The navy spokesman described the “anomaly” as “singular, short, violent and non-nuclear.”

Relatives of the crew who had gathered at the Mar del Plata base to receive psychological counseling broke into tears and hugged each other after they received the news. Some fell on their knees or clung to a fence crowded with blue-and-white Argentine flags, rosary beads and messages of support. Most declined to speak, while a few others lashed out in anger at the navy’s response.

“They sent a piece of crap to sail,” said Itati Leguizamon, wife of submarine crew member German Suarez. “They inaugurated a submarine with a coat of paint and a flag in 2014, but without any equipment inside. The navy is to blame for its 15 years of abandonment.”

Balbi defended the Argentine Navy, saying that “with respect to the maintenance and state of our naval and air units, no unit ever leaves port or takes off if it isn’t in operating conditions to navigate or fly with total security.”

The German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in 1985 and was most recently refitted in 2014.

During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts say that refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers and even the smallest mistake during the cutting phase of the operation can put the safety of the ship and the crew at risk.

The Argentine navy and outside experts have said that even if the ARA San Juan is intact, its crew might have only enough oxygen to be submerged seven to 10 days. It lost contact as it was sailing from the extreme southern port of Ushuaia. The submarine’s captain had reported a battery failure.

Authorities said late Wednesday that Argentine navy ships as well a U.S. P-8 Poseidon aircraft and a Brazilian air force plane would return to the area to check out the abnormal sound, which originated about 30 miles north of the submarine’s last registered position.

The search location straddles the edge of the continental shelf, with widely varying ocean depths, some as great as 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Experts say the submarine could not have supported pressures that far down.

“If a submarine goes below its crush-depth, it would implode, it would just collapse,” said James H. Patton Jr. a retired Navy captain. “It would sound like a very, very big explosion to any listening device.”

Whatever it was, U.S. Navy Lt. Lily Hinz said the sound detected “was not a whale, and it is not a regularly occurring sound.”

Claudio Rodriguez, brother of crew member Hernan Rodriguez, said his family suspects “the explosion was so strong that they were not able to rise to the surface or shoot any flares. They didn’t have time for anything.”

“As a family, we’re grateful to all the people who prayed for us and for the families of all the 44,” he said.

More than a dozen airplanes and ships have been participating in the multinational search despite stormy weather that has caused waves of more than 20 feet (6 meters). Search teams are combing an area of some 185,000 square miles (480,000 square kilometers), which is roughly the size of Spain.

The U.S. government has sent two P-8 Poseidons, a naval research ship, a submarine rescue chamber and sonar-equipped underwater vehicles. U.S. Navy sailors from the San Diego-based Undersea Rescue Command were also helping with the search.

Britain’s Ministry of Defense sent a special airplane with emergency life support pods to join the hunt that includes planes and ships from a dozen nations.

Hopes were buoyed after brief satellite calls were received and when sounds were detected deep in the South Atlantic. But experts later determined that neither was from the missing sub.

“They haven’t come back and they will never come back,” said Jesica Gopar, wife of submarine officer Fernando Santilli, choking back tears. “I had a bad feeling about this and now it has been confirmed.”","testban monitoring organization

"Farai Mutsaka, Christopher Torchia / AP",,2017-11-24T01:37:59Z,time,"Robert Mugabe Won't Face Prosecution, Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Says",http://time.com/5036197/robert-mugabe-zimbabwe-resign-prosecution/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-1772026451.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"(HARARE, Zimbabwe) — Zimbabwe’s ruling party assured Robert Mugabe that he wouldn’t be prosecuted if he resigned, a party official said Thursday, as the fate of the 93-year-old became clearer and the country prepared to move on.

“Prosecuting him was never part of the plan,” ZANU-PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke told The Associated Press. “He is safe, his family is safe and his status as a hero of his country is assured. All we were saying is resign or face impeachment.”

As Zimbabwe prepared to witness the swearing-in of new president Emmerson Mnangagwa on Friday morning, its citizens circulated on social media a new photo showing what appeared to be Mugabe at the end of his 37-year rule.

Mugabe and his wife are shown sitting on a sofa with advisers standing behind them. A dejected-looking Grace Mugabe, who just days ago had been poised to replace Mnangagwa after his firing as vice president and even succeed her husband, looks off camera. A listing Robert Mugabe’s eyes are closed. The photo could not immediately be verified.

Mugabe, who resigned on Tuesday as lawmakers began impeaching him, has not spoken publicly since his stunning speech on Sunday defying calls from the military, ruling party and the people to step down.

But it appears he and his wife will remain in the capital, Harare.

According to protocol, Mugabe could even be present at the 75-year-old Mnangagwa’s swearing-in on Friday morning at a 60,000-seat stadium after making a triumphant return to the country. He fled shortly after his firing, claiming threats to his life.

Mnangagwa’s speech upon his return Wednesday night outside ruling party headquarters promised “a new, unfolding democracy” and efforts to rebuild a shattered economy. But he also recited slogans from the ruling ZANU-PF party, unlikely to reassure the opposition.

The opposition party MDC-T, which supported Mugabe’s removal, said it had not been invited to the inauguration. Spokesman Obert Guru said the party was closely watching Mnangagwa’s next moves, “particularly regarding the dismantling of all the oppressive pillars of repression.”

In a new statement Thursday, Mnangagwa urged Zimbabweans against “vengeful retribution.”

The pastor who led large anti-government protests last year, Evan Mawarire, says Zimbabweans should let Mnangagwa know that the country should be for everyone and not just the ruling party.

Mnangagwa, a former justice and defense minister with close ties to the military who served for decades as Mugabe’s enforcer, remains on a U.S. sanctions list over allegations of violently cracking down on opponents.

He fled Zimbabwe after being fired on Nov. 6 and was in hiding during the week-long political drama that led to Mugabe’s resignation. His appearance on Wednesday, flanked by heavy security, delighted supporters who hope he can guide Zimbabwe out of political and economic turmoil.

Mnangagwa will serve Mugabe’s remaining term until elections at some point next year. Opposition lawmakers who have alleged vote-rigging in the past say balloting must be free and fair, a call the United States and others have echoed.

Mugabe’s resignation was met with wild celebrations by people thrilled to be rid of a leader whose early promise after taking power at the end of white minority rule in 1980 was overshadowed by economic collapse, government dysfunction and human rights violations.

On Thursday, an editorial in the privately run NewsDay newspaper said Mnangagwa has “an unenviable task” and that he should set up a coalition government that represents all Zimbabweans.","emmerson mnangagwa

After browsing bargains from Target, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, J.C. Penney, Macy’s, and the rest of the retail field, we’ve come up with a master list of the absolute best Black Friday deals.

One of Amazon’s Black Friday deals will feature a 32-inch TV for under $70. Walmart has impressive sales on new iPhones and Samsung TVs. And multiple stores have outstanding deals on video game consoles like the Microsoft Xbox One S 500GB and Playstation 4. Shoppers hunting for Black Friday deals will find bargains on even more TVs, Apple tech, laptops, gaming consoles, hot toys, clothing, housewares, and more.

In most cases, the best Black Friday deals don’t require you to wait until Black Friday to take advantage of sales. Most items listed below are available at retailer websites starting just after midnight on Wednesday, November 22. In other words, just as Thanksgiving Day 2017 commences, Black Friday sales begin for folks shopping on laptops or other devices.

Other sales pop off in stores on Thanksgiving Day itself. And in some cases the “Black Friday” deals highlighted below are live right now. For example, nearly everything sold by Gap (in store or online) is already being discounted by 50%, and Amazon is already selling the Fire HD10 Tablet for $99.99, or $50 off the list price. So check with each retailer to see when Black Friday discounts are deepest.

Before shopping, take note of special Black Friday deals that come with bonus gift cards or retailer bonus cash.

Associated Press,,2017-11-22T08:03:21Z,time,The U.S. Navy Says an Aircraft With 11 Aboard Has Crashed Into the Pacific Ocean,http://time.com/5034703/navy-aircraft-crash-pacific/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-490736182.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"TOKYO — Eight people were rescued and three remained missing after a U.S. Navy plane crashed into the western Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, the Navy said.

The C-2 “Greyhound” transport aircraft came down about 500 nautical miles (925 kilometers) southeast of Okinawa as it was bringing passengers and cargo from Japan to the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, the Navy said in a statement.

The Reagan was operating in the Philippine Sea during a joint exercise with Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force when the twin-propeller plane crashed at 2:45 p.m. Japan time. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear and the incident will be investigated, the Navy said.

Eight people were rescued about 40 minutes later. They were taken to the Reagan for medical evaluation and are in good condition, the Navy said.

U.S. and Japanese naval ships and aircraft are searching for the missing. Japan’s Defense Ministry said the crash site is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Okinotorishima, a Japanese atoll.

The names of the crew and passengers are being withheld pending notification of next of kin.

Philippine military spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla said his military alerted its ships and aircraft shortly after learning about the crash but could not provide help because of the distance from the country.

The Nov. 16-26 joint exercise in waters off Okinawa has been described by the Navy as the “premier training event” between the U.S. and Japanese navies, designed to increase defensive readiness and interoperability in air and sea operations.

The Navy’s Japan-based 7th Fleet has had two fatal accidents in Asian waters this year, leaving 17 sailors dead and prompting the removal of eight top Navy officers from their posts, including the 7th Fleet commander.

The USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker collided near Singapore in August, leaving 10 U.S. sailors dead. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided off Japan.

The Navy has concluded that the collisions were avoidable and resulted from widespread failures by the crews and commanders, who didn’t quickly recognize and respond to unfolding emergencies. A Navy report recommended numerous changes to address the problems, ranging from improved training to increasing sleep and stress management for sailors.","restituto padilla

David Eggert / AP,,2017-11-22T14:20:32Z,time,Former USA Gymnastics Doctor Larry Nassar Pleads Guilty to Molesting Girls,http://time.com/5034888/larry-nassar-sexual-assault-usa-gymnastics/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/larry-nassar-guilty-sexual-assault.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"(LANSING, Mich.) — A sports doctor accused of molesting girls while working for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University pleaded guilty Wednesday to multiple charges of sexual assault and will face at least 25 years in prison.

Dr. Larry Nassar, 54, was charged with molesting seven girls, mostly under the guise of treatment at his Lansing-area home and a campus clinic. All but one of his accusers was a gymnast. He faces similar charges in a neighboring county and lawsuits filed by more than 125 women and girls.

Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas are among the women who have publicly said they were among Nassar’s victims.

Some of his accusers attended the hearing Wednesday in a packed Ingham County courtroom.

The plea deal in Ingham County calls for a minimum prison sentence of 25 years, but a judge could set the minimum sentence as high as 40 years. In Michigan, inmates are eligible for parole after serving a minimum sentence.

The girls have testified that Nassar molested them with his hands, sometimes when a parent was present in the room, while they sought help for gymnastics injuries.

“He convinced these girls that this was some type of legitimate treatment,” Assistant Attorney General Angela Poviliatis told a judge last summer. “Why would they question him? Why would they question this gymnastics god?”

Separately, Nassar is charged with similar crimes in Eaton County, the location of an elite gymnastics club. He also is awaiting sentencing in federal court on child pornography charges.

The Michigan criminal cases against Nassar followed reports last year in the Indianapolis Star about how USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians, mishandled complaints about sexual misconduct involving the doctor and coaches. Women and girls said the stories inspired them to step forward with detailed allegations of abuse, sometimes when their parents were in the exam room at Michigan State.","aly raisman mckayla maroney

Joe Barton (R-Tex.) has apologized after an anonymous user posted a nude photo of him on social media earlier this week.

“While separated from my second wife, prior to the divorce, I had sexual relationships with other mature adult women,” Barton said in a statement on Wednesday, the Texas Tribune reports. “Each was consensual. Those relationships have ended. I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days. I am sorry that I let my constituents down.”

Barton, who has served in the House of Representatives since 1985, announced earlier this month that he would seek reelection. In an interview with the Tribune on Tuesday, he said he was contemplating his political future.

“You’re as aware of what was posted as I am,” he said. “I am talking to a number of people, all of whom I have faith in and am deciding how to respond, quite frankly.”

It’s unclear if the person who posted the photo of Barton violated laws prohibiting the distribution of nude images without the subject’s consent, a practice sometimes called “revenge porn.”","house of representatives

Back in March, the Tesla founder made a bet on Twitter with Mike Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian, an Australian enterprise software company, that he would be able to install the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in Australia within 100 days, or he would supply it for free. That “free” would have been anything but to Musk, who said failing to meet the deadline would have cost him “$50 million or more,” Business Insider reports.

The 129-megawatt-hour battery was being built by Musk for South Australia, which generates a substantial percentage of its energy from wind power. Musk vowed to install the battery within 100 days of signing as agreement with the state government, which he did in September.

Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

The goal with the battery pack is to make South Australia more self-sufficient and able to provide backup power and affordable energy to South Australians during the summer months.

The battery is part of a $550 million plan by South Australia to help guarantee its power supply after a string of blackouts over the last 18 months. The state has not indicated how much it is paying Musk for the battery. A 250MW gas-fired generator is also expected to come online in the area next summer to help ease energy concerns.

Musk also recently supplied battery power to help aid Puerto Rico’s electrical grid following the devastating hurricane earlier this year.","musk for south australia

Billy Perrigo,,2017-11-23T13:58:02Z,time,How Black Friday Sales Madness Came to the U.K.,http://time.com/5036097/black-friday-britain-sales/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-625730794.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Before 2010, Black Friday didn’t exist in Britain. Now, the yearly retail sales bonanza is almost as ubiquitous in the U.K. as it is in the United States, and its tremendous growth shows little sign of slowing down in 2017.

In fact, this Friday Brits are expected to spend £1.8m ($2.39m) per minute on Black Friday, an eight percent increase on last year. That’s a faster rate of growth than in the U.S. — in a country that doesn’t even celebrate Thanksgiving. How did it happen?

Naturally it was American companies that brought Black Friday across the Atlantic. Amazon was one of the first, beginning to offer discounts in 2010. Amazon’s “global footprint” was key to turning Black Friday into a reality outside the U.S., Paul Murphy, analytics director at the consumer insight firm Kantar, tells TIME. “This is being driven much more by those people than the high street retailers.”

But the high street had no choice but to keep up, and that’s what they did – at least initially. Electronics retailer Currys PC World began to offer discounts in 2012, followed by the supermarkets Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury’s in 2013 and 2014. “Retailers are under continual pressure to keep their prices competitive,” says Murphy. “You have to play on such a key weekend.”

It was in 2013 that Black Friday truly entered the British consciousness. As prices in some stores were slashed by as much as eighty percent, hysteria broke out. Videos emerged from a London Asda of throngs of people clambering over each other, shouting and swearing, all to reach heavily discounted widescreen televisions during a U.S.-style “doorbuster” event.

Fights broke out, with police called to dozens of stores, the Telegraph reported at the time. A church leader lamented that the “ugly side of human nature” had been revealed. Shoppers compared the situation in supermarkets across the country to a “war zone.” (Americans, of course, are familiar with these kinds of frenzied scenes — in 2008, a Walmart worker was trampled to death by a crowd of shoppers).

In the wake of these events – but also because of the acute logistical strain caused by a massive influx of sales in a short period of time – some British shops scaled back. Asda didn’t run a Black Friday sale in 2015 or 2016, opting instead to run a number of smaller sales throughout the month of November. Amazon is now hosting 10 days of sales rather than packing everything into a single day.

Now, according to Kantar, 68% of people are choosing to do their Black Friday shopping online in the U.K., compared to just 26% in store – perhaps to be expected, given it is an ordinary working day for Brits.

So it’s unlikely fights will be breaking out in malls across the U.K. this year. Nevertheless, British consumers, burdened by inflation and a weak pound, are warming to the idea of sales occurring before rather than after Christmas. The holiday comes at a critical time of year, many people’s last payday before they do their Christmas shopping.

But whilst it might be good for consumers, pressure to engage with Black Friday might actually be hurting businesses in the long run. “Just winning at the weekend isn’t how retailing works,” says Murphy. “You need to win every day.”","atlantic amazon

Tamara Khandaker,"The Canadian government keeps saying there are 60 returned foreign fighters in the country, but experts say more context is needed.",2017-11-23T19:20:22+00:00,vice-news,"Chill out about returning foreign fighters, experts tell Canadians",https://news.vice.com/story/chill-out-about-returning-foreign-fighters-experts-tell-canadians,https://news2-images.vice.com//uploads/2017/09/farah-mohamed-shirdon-1024x576.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"Unlike England and France, which are seeing hundreds of fighters who travelled to Syria to join Islamic State militants return home, Canada should not expect a big influx of battle-hardened returnees, say experts, who are urging for calm amid recent alarms raised over the issue.

“I think Canadians need to calm the fuck down,” tweeted an exasperated Amarnath Amarasingam, a renowned expert on Western foreign fighters at the University of Waterloo on Tuesday. “We don’t have dozens of highly trained fighters back here. Most are dead. Some women and their kids will definitely come back. And we need to think about how to rehabilitate and reintegrate these kids.

“Don’t mean to sound too flippant, but we need to put ‘threat’ in context,” Amarasingam continued.

Two years ago, Canada’s Ministry of Public Safety was aware of 60 “extremist travelers” who had returned to Canada out of 180 people who were abroad and suspected of engaging in terrorism.

I think that number is open to all kinds of questions.

Official Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer demanded on Monday during Question Period that the government disclose how many returning Islamic State fighters “are now being welcomed back to Canada by the prime minister with the promise of reintegration services to help them,” in reference to the government’s preferred approach of aiming to reintegrate returnees instead of killing them abroad.

Goodale reiterated that the number of returnees known to the Canadian government is in the “order of 60.”

“Although we do not anticipate a large influx of returning foreign fighters, the government of Canada takes the threat they may pose very seriously, and we will continue to monitor and respond to the threat as appropriate,” Public Safety Canada spokesperson Karine Martle told VICE News in an email.

The debate in the House of Commons comes after a report last month from the US-based Soufan Centre said 5,600 ISIS fighters had returned from Iraq and Syria to their countries of origin. This includes about 400 of the 3,417 fighters from Russia, 760 of the 3,244 from Saudi Arabia, 800 of the 2,926 from Tunisia, 271 of the 1,910 from France, and 425 of the 850 people from the UK.

Everyone is determined to freak the crap out over extremist returnees to Canada. You could do that OR you could read Amar’s thread on making sense out of the numbers. https://t.co/ZNmJdfbFpK — Stephanie Carvin (@StephanieCarvin) November 22, 2017

The study said the flow of foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq came to a halt in late 2015, after ISIS began to suffer serious battlefield blows and countries implemented tighter travel restrictions.

Researchers studying Western fighters abroad say Canada should not expect a flood of returning foreign fighters, while urging the government to be more transparent about who the 60 supposed returnees in the country are.

“I think that number is open to all kinds of questions,” Lorne Dawson, another University of Waterloo professor studying Western foreign fighters, told VICE News. “We’ve inquired about the number and have received evasive answers.”

Dawson explains the initial figure of 180 people leaving Canada to fight includes everyone who has gone overseas to do anything terrorism-related. This includes, for example, those who went abroad and interacted with family members with connections to organizations like Hezbollah, and Canadian residents who travelled to Libya in the lead-up to the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gadaffi — not necessarily people who went to join ISIS in Syria and Iraq. They could also be returnees from conflicts in Yemen and Somalia.

“It’s really a big grab bag of people. It certainly shouldn’t be interpreted as those who were engaged in combat or warfare or serious terrorism in Syria or Iraq,” he said.

The Canadian government has been very sloppy with how it talks about returnees.

Since 2012, about 100 people have left for Syria and Iraq, according to Dawson and Amarasingam’s research. The professors can identify 65 of them by name. Most joined ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate, which are listed terrorist groups. Others joined groups that aren’t formally listed terrorist entities and therefore won’t be charged if they return.

“The Canadian government has been very sloppy with how it talks about returnees,” said Amarasingam, going on to explain why the numbers security officials have floated need more context.

He estimates that 22 former Canadian residents who joined ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra have since died.

That death toll could be higher, especially since the conflict has become particularly lethal for ISIS members in the past few months, making it more difficult for researchers to communicate with sources on the ground.

Another issue is that the government includes in their number of returnees at least 6 people who went to Syria, came back to Canada, and left again (and possibly died), said Dawson. One example is Ahmed Waseem, of Windsor, who returned to Canada claiming that he’d been injured near the Syrian border. He later returned to Syria despite his imam and family’s efforts to get him to stay, and may have died there.

Dawson said he’s aware of about a dozen ISIS fighters who have returned. He expects the grand total Canada will ever see is between 20 and 25. Based on statistics from previous conflicts, it’s safe to assume at least a third of those who have gone abroad to join ISIS have died, and that half of those who are left won’t return to Canada, knowing they’ll likely to be charged with terrorism offences. He expects them to move to places where they believe the struggle is continuing — Yemen, Somalia, and the Philippines, for example.

It only takes only one individual to make their way back into Canada, who is still seriously radicalized

Of those who do come back to Canada, a third will be likely disillusioned with the cause and another third will be suffering from PTSD, which is likely to neutralize them as a threat, Dawson said.

“The threat to Canada is small, it’s manageable, but it’s very real,” said Dawson. “It only takes only one individual to make their way back into Canada, who is still seriously radicalized.”

Classic intelligence practices say the best approach is to track returnees and engage in a long debriefing process upon their return to Canada. Unless there’s enough evidence to lay criminal charges, then let them go, Dawson explained. Next, intelligence officials would see if there’s enough evidence based on their social media activity to issue a terrorism peace bond. While the suspect is on a peace bond, Canadian authorities would work with international agencies to collect information to build a case for prosecution.

The government would not go into specifics into how returning foreign fighters are monitored, but outlined a number of other security measures that are already in place. The Criminal Code makes it an offence to leave or attempt to leave Canada to commit certain terrorist acts, and the RCMP’s National Security Joint Operations Centre examines cases of “extremist travelers” to coordinate responses.

The Passenger Protect Program, otherwise known as a no-fly list, is supposed to mitigate threats to transportation security and disrupt travel for terrorism purposes by denying boarding. The government can also cancel, revoke, or refuse passports in order to prevent national security threats, a Public Safety official told VICE News.

But Canada needs to be “much more transparent about these numbers and how they are calculated,” said Amarasingam. “Too much needless classification, which is creating too much needless confusion and alarm.”","stephanie carvin stephaniecarvin

The 75-year-old, due to be sworn in as president Friday, was returning from South Africa, where he had fled in fear for his safety after being sacked as the country’s vice-president earlier this month.

Now poised to become the country’s second leader in 37 years, Mnangagwa promised an ambitious, optimistic new direction for the once prosperous country that, under decades of misrule, has become an economic basket-case and international pariah.

“We want to grow our economy, we want peace in our country, we want jobs, jobs, jobs,” he told the crowd.

He acknowledged that international assistance would be necessary, a sign that he is looking to bring the country out of international isolation.

“We need the cooperation of the continent of Africa. We need the cooperation of our friends outside the continent,” he said.

Mnangagwa will need all the help he can get. He faces huge challenges in reversing the fortunes of an economy ruined by decades of mismanagement.

Once considered Africa’s bread-basket, Zimbabwe’s economy has shrunk by half since the turn of the century, when the government launched a disastrous program of farm seizures. The country hasn’t had its own currency since 2009, when hyperinflation destroyed its dollar, unemployment runs at about 90 percent, and the country has an estimated $11 billion in debt it can’t repay.

The good news for Mnangagwa is that the removal of Robert Mugabe gives him a honeymoon period, Chris Vandome, a research analyst at London’s Chatham House think tank, told VICE News. Amid the goodwill accompanying the ouster of the world’s third-longest serving statesman, domestic and international stakeholders will be prepared to give Mnangagwa chance to come up with a roadmap to save the shattered economy and harness the country’s considerable resources, including in mining, agriculture, and a skilled potential labor force.

Reforming failed economic policies will be a priority to rebuild confidence, attract the international investment needed to recapitalize the economy, and entice members of the three million-strong diaspora to return.

The new administration will need push through reforms on multiple fronts, including reworking laws that have weakened property rights and scared off foreign investors, stamping out corruption, and reducing the huge public sector wage bill – which currently accounts for the bulk of government spending. The new administration will also need to negotiate its huge foreign debt with international lenders.

Fixing the economy – Zimbabwe’s most immediate concern – will satisfy another critical challenge for Mnangagwa­: establishing his legitimacy and identity as a leader, said Vandome.

While Mnangagwa­, known as “The Crocodile” for his political wile and longevity, has strong credentials as a veteran of the independence movement, he lacks Mugabe’s standing as a national liberation hero. There have been questions for some Zimbabweans about the legality of his rise to power, given he lacked any formal position in government after his sacking.

“There’s an opportunity for Mnangagwa­ to build his legitimacy around being the one who turned around the economy,” said Vandome.

“Whereas Mugabe was willing to make political decisions regardless of economic consequences, Mnangagwa­ is seen as more business-friendly, more pragmatic and is expected to prioritize economic policy.”

Still, analysts aren’t overly optimistic about his prospects of turning the country around. An analysis by The Economist Intelligence Unit this week said the change of leadership was “unlikely to signal a rapid end to Zimbabwe’s political and economic stagnation.” However, it said it should lead to some reengagement with the international community – critical to reversing the country’s fortunes – and at least trigger an upward revision in miserable GDP growth forecasts.

There’s also the prospect that Mnangagwa will be forced to enact this ambitious reform program in the shadow of his former boss – as well as his arch-rival, former first lady Grace Mugabe. A spokesman for Zimbabwe’s military said Thursday that Mugabe and his wife have been granted immunity from prosecution as part of the agreement to step down, raising the prospect that the former first family will remain in the country.","millionstrong diaspora

The social network revealed Thursday it is creating “a portal to enable people on Facebook to learn which of the Internet Research Agency Facebook Pages or Instagram accounts they may have liked or followed between January 2015 and August 2017.”

The Internet Research Agency, an infamous St. Petersburg-based troll farm with links to the Kremlin, has been blamed for much of the government-backed disinformation campaign designed to disrupt the 2016 election.

The initiative is part of Facebook’s continuing effort to be more transparent about the network’s infiltration by fake Russian accounts; the network admitted content from fake Russian accounts could have reached as many as 126 million people over the two-year period, and a further 20 million on Instagram.

Facebook, along with Google and Twitter, faced Congress earlier this month to answer questions about how the infiltration happened and what steps are being taken to remove it.

In a meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied meddling in the U.S. vote. Trump said he believed him.

“He did not do what they are saying he did,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.

Facebook has said it is trying to be more transparent about who is buying ads on its network, but a report by ProPublica this week showed it still has major issues.

The report disputes Facebook’s claim that it had built a system to spot and reject ads that discriminated based on race.

ProPublica said it bought dozens of rental housing ads on Facebook last week but was still able to ask that they not be shown to certain categories of users, such as African Americans, mothers of high school kids, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews, expats from Argentina and Spanish speakers.

Facebook said “this was a failure in our enforcement and we’re disappointed that we fell short of our commitments.”","asiapacific economic cooperation summit

Beijing toddlers “fed pills and given injections” at kindergarten

Chinese special police officers stand guard at the gate of the RYB Education Kindergarten after parents accusing RYB Kindergarten of abusing and their children in Beijing, China, 23 November 2017. (AP)

Three kindergarten teachers in Beijing were suspended this week after several parents claimed their children had been injected with unknown substances.

Parents have been protesting outside the kindergarten in Beijing’s upscale Chaoyang district since claims emerged that the toddlers of at least eight parents had been molested, fed pills and given injections.

Authorities in the Chinese capital have launched a wave of security checks on local kindergartens in response.

“My child is only three-and-a-half years, and I found needle marks on his thighs and buttocks. I am trembling with anger now,” one parent said, according to the state-run Global Times.

Parents have been demanding access to surveillance footage that could confirm the abuse after children claimed they had been given pills to make them sleep, and others reported being physically examined in a dark room.

Photographs of the alleged needle marks on the childrens’ bodies have circulated online, sparking widespread outrage on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

The case is the third recent abuse scandal to hit China’s early childhood education industry, creating panic among middle-class parents who send their children to private kindergartens.

Earlier this month, there were claims that staff at a day-care in Shanghai had beaten children in their care and force fed them wasabi.

The kindergarten at the center of the latest allegations is run by RYB Education, which claims to be China’s largest early childhood provider, with more than 1,100 nurseries and pre-school centers around the country.

The company said in a statement it was “deeply sorry” for the situation, and was waiting on the findings of the police investigations.

“We are cooperating with the police by providing relevant surveillance material and equipment. The teachers involved have been suspended,” said the statement.

North Korea is not taking their soldier’s defection well

North Korea has replaced all its border guards and is planting trees and digging trenches around the DMZ to deter future defections to South Korea.

Authorities in Pyongyang replaced between 35 and 40 border patrol guards after one of their members succeeded in an audacious escape bid on Nov. 13, despite being shot five times.

A South Korean intelligence official quoted by the Yonhap news agency said the soldiers may have faced disciplinary action.

“Signs were detected that North Korea has replaced all border security officials following the defection,” the source said. “Given this situation, commanders of the responsible military unit and senior officers might have undergone punishment.”

Acting U.S. ambassador to South Korea Marc Knapper paid a visit this week to the Joint Security Area — the part of the Demilitarized Zone where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face.

He posted a picture on Twitter showing soldiers on the North Korean side digging deep trenches and planting trees.

Dramatic video footage of the escape was released this week, showing the unnamed defector fleeing in a military jeep, and then on foot.

The defector has now regained consciousness. Three South Korean and two U.S. soldiers were awarded the Army Commendation medal for dragging the him to safety.

After 37 years, Zimbabwe has a new president

Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in as Zimbabwe’s new president Friday, becoming only the second person to lead the country in nearly four decades.

The 75-year-old took the oath of office in front of tens of thousands of cheering supporters at a packed stadium in the capital, Harare. Greeting the crowd with a raised fist, Mnangagwa pledged to “be faithful to Zimbabwe.”

The ceremony marks a stunning reversal of fortune for Mnangagwa, who earlier this month was sacked as the country’s vice president and fled to South Africa, fearing for his safety. His dismissal triggered the political turmoil that prompted the army to intervene and force Robert Mugabe to quit.

Mugabe was not at the ceremony to witness his former confidant formally usurp him, but officials from the ruling ZANU-PF party have said he will remain in Zimbabwe, immune from prosecution.

READ MORE: Mugabe’s successor has landed an impossible job

Returning to Zimbabwe Wednesday, Mnangagwa promised the dawn of “a new and unfolding democracy” for a country that had become economically ruined and internationally isolated by decades of authoritarian misrule.

He has promised to uphold democracy, and reach out to other countries for help in rebuilding Zimbabwe.

But strong links to the former regime mean questions remain over whether the swearing in of the man known as “The Crocodile” signals a true break with the past.

Mnangagwa, who was Zimbabwe’s spy chief during a bloody civil conflict in the 1980s, is associated with some of the worst atrocities of the Mugabe era, including massacres in 1983 when an estimated 20,000 people were killed in a political crackdown.

Mnangagwa has denied any involvement in the killings.

Putin tells Russian industry to “be ready” for war

Vladimir Putin alerted Russian industry to be prepared to switch production to military needs Wednesday, warning all “large-scale enterprise” should be ready for conflict.

Speaking at a conference of military leaders and arms dealers in Sochi, the Russian president outlined how all industries should be ready to do their bit for the Motherland.

“The ability of our economy to increase military production and services at a given time is one of the most important aspects of military security,” Putin said. “To this end, all strategic, and simply large-scale enterprise should be ready, regardless of ownership.”

Putin told the audience he had flagged this issue as far back as 2015, issuing instructions “to modernize production facilities, build up reserves of material and technical resources, and ensure the transportation of troops.”

This followed a Tuesday speech in which Putin said Russian military needed to have “the very best equipment — better than foreign equivalents.”

“If we want to win, we have to be better.”

Increased investment by the Kremlin has elevated Russia to the world’s third largest military spender with a total budget of almost $70 billion in 2016, it emerged earlier this year.

However, Moscow’s spending still lags far behind to China ($215 billion) and the U.S. ($611 billion).

Holocaust memorial built next to “anti-Semitic” politician’s house

Far-right German politician Björn Höcke woke up Wednesday to a new view out of his window — a Holocaust memorial.

Eleven months after he called Berlin’s tribute to Nazi victims a “monument of shame,” activists rented land adjacent to his home in the Thuringian village of Bornhagen and erected a miniature version of the memorial.

A Berlin artists’ initiative called the Center for Political Beauty raised more than €40,000 in a crowd-funding campaign to pay for construction and rent on the property.

The memorial consists of 24 concrete slabs, which the cooperative wants to keep it in place for at least five years.

Berlin’s “Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe” features almost 3,000 commemorative blocks covering five acres.

“Because Höcke is a ‘secret admirer’ of the monument, we’re going to build it right outside the house,” the artists said in a video released Wednesday.

The group said they will remove the installation if Höcke falls to his knees and begs forgiveness for Germany’s actions during World War II.

Höcke, a politician with the populist Alternative for Germany party, was seen Wednesday morning inspecting the construction through a pair of binoculars.

South Korea — November 22, 2017

This is how quickly you run to escape North Korea

Dramatic video of a North Korean defector fleeing across the Demilitarized Zone while being fired upon by his fellow border guards was released Tuesday by the United Nations Command.

The closed circuit TV footage shows the unnamed soldier racing towards the border village of Panmunjom in a military jeep, pursued by his compatriots.

After the vehicle crashes, the defector runs to freedom, flanked by soldiers unloading their weapons.

He was shot five times before collapsing near the southern border of the DMZ where three members of South Korea’s security forces crawl out and drag him to safety.

The escape took place just after 3 p.m. on Nov. 13.

The defector is in a South Korean hospital, but doctors said last week he is struggling to recover due to the “enormous number” of parasites in his intestines.

Lead surgeon, Lee Cook-jong he had “only seen something like this in a textbook,” and revealed that the longest worm removed was 11 inches long.

The soldier has now regained consciousness and has asked to watch television, South Korean news agency Yonhap reports.

He is being shown South Korean films for his “psychological comfort,” the official said.

Lebanon’s PM rethinks quitting after getting the hell out of Saudi

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Saad Hariri reversed his shock resignation Wednesday after returning from Saudi Arabia, where the Lebanese government said he was coerced into quitting.

The PM unexpectedly announced he was standing down in a televised appearance from Riyadh earlier this month, sparking claims from his own government that he was being held hostage, part of the increasing regional tensions between the Kingdom and Iran.

Hariri said Wednesday he had presented his resignation to President Michel Aoun, but had been asked to “put it on hold ahead of further consultations.”

“He urged me to wait before offering it and to hold onto it for more dialogue about its reasons and political background, and I showed responsiveness,” Hariri said. Aoun had previously refused to accept the resignation unless it was made in person.

Hariri, who left Saudi Arabia following the intervention of Lebanon’s former colonial power France, has denied that Riyadh forced his resignation, during which he accused Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah of destabilizing his country.

There are fears the episode could spark conflict in Lebanon, a fragile multi-confessional democracy, by fueling tensions between the Saudi-backed political faction and Hezbollah, the most powerful force in the country.

Russia — November 21, 2017

Assad sneaked into Russia to thank Putin for “saving” Syria

Syria’s embattled president Bashar al-Assad has dared to leave his country only twice since it descended into a civil war six years ago. Both times, he’s gone to Russia to meet his strongest ally: Vladimir Putin.

On Monday, Assad slipped secretly into the Russian city of Sochi to thank Putin and a room full of Russian generals for “saving our country” after Russia intervened heavily against Assad’s enemies, some of which were backed by the United States. Assad’s previous trip to Russia, in October 2015, came right after Russia launched operations on his behalf.

Now, Putin appears to be maneuvering to become the key arbiter of Syria’s political future. Putin told Assad he planned to call Donald Trump later to discuss their conversation, before holding talks on Syria’s future with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran.

Unnamed Kremlin sources told Russia’s RBC news outlet that Russia plans to wrap up major operations in Syria by December this year, leaving behind only a small contingent for base maintenance.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently said Assad has “no role” to play in post-conflict Syria. But on Tuesday, a Kremlin spokesperson told reporters Assad’s future “can only be seen by the Syrian people.”

Turkey just banned pretty much all LGBT events in its capital

Last week Turkey’s capital city, Ankara, banned a German gay film festival, saying it could incite terror attacks. This week, local authorities decided to go ahead and just ban anything similar from ever happening again.

In a statement wide open to interpretation, the governor’s office announced it won’t allow any “film screenings” or “theater plays” related to homosexuality, or any such “panels, talks [or] exhibitions.”

The governor’s office said the ban is necessary to keep from stirring up the “hatred and hostility” of local residents, and the associated “danger that may arise in terms of public security.”

But rights groups said the move is akin to “criminalizing LGBTI existence” in the city.

“In an omnibus ban with a very wide scope, we are facing a situation that is vague, and open to interpretation and rights violations,” two Ankara-based LGBTI-rights groups, Pink Life and Kaos GL, said in a joint statement following the announcement by Ankara.

Homosexuality has been legal in Turkey since 1923, but rights groups say homophobia and discrimination are rampant amid a growing backlash by authorities in cities like Ankara and Istanbul. In 2015, for example, police drove off participants in Istanbul’s annual gay pride parade with tear gas and rubber bullets. Since then, the event “has been unjustifiably and unlawfully suppressed,” according to Amnesty International.

Germany’s embassy had helped organize the gay film festival that was banned last week, and the move seems likely to worsen the already strained relationship between Turkey and the European Union.

The Council of Europe’s independent Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muiznieks, issued a statement immediately slapping Ankara for the prohibition.

“The authorities’ duty is to protect these persons from the extremists and potential criminals threatening them, not restrict their rights,” he said in a statement on Twitter.

The move represents “growing intolerance towards LGBTI persons by the Turkish authorities,” he continued.

Turkey has faced widespread criticism in recent months over human rights abuses, including the arrest of tens of thousands in the wake of a failed coup attempt in 2016. Human rights advocates like local director of Amnesty International, Idil Eser, were among those swept up in the purge. Eser was recently freed after four months in jail but is still facing trial.

U.S. bans alcohol for 54,000 troops based in Japan

Takeshi Onaga in their meeting at the prefectural government office in Naha on Nov. 20, 2017. The U.S. military is under fire over an alleged drunk driving incident involving an Okinawa-based Marine which killed a local man. (Kyodo)

All 54,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan were ordered to stay away from alcohol for an indefinite period starting Monday after a 21-year-old Marine crashed his 2-ton military truck into another vehicle, killing the driver. The Marine had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit, according to local police.

The governor of Okinawa was furious.

“It’s the same thing over and over again every time. I’m speechless,” Takeshi Onaga, Okinawa’s governor, told reporters.

In this instance, a 61-year-old man named Hidemasa Taira died in the hospital after being hit by Nicholas James-McLean at around 5:25 a.m. Witnesses said James-McLean cruised through a red light while the Japanese driver was turning right. He sustained minor injuries.

A similar 30-day ban was placed on American troops in Japan in 2016 after what local press called a “crime spree” by U.S. military personnel, including a drunken sailor striking two cars while driving the wrong way down a busy highway, and another soldier charged with raping and killing a 19-year-old Japanese woman, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase in the woods.

American military personnel have been making headlines recently for drunken antics, crimes, and misbehavior. Most recently the Navy apologized after one of its pilots used his jet to sky-write a gigantic penis in the skies over Washington state.

Germany skids into crisis after coalition talks collapse

Germans face an unwelcome return to the polls for another national election after coalition talks collapsed Sunday, leaving the European powerhouse in political limbo.

After four weeks of negotiations, the free-market liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) exited talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, and the Greens.

FDP leader Christian Lindner said there was “no basis of trust” among the parties, who had “no shared vision” of the country’s direction following September’s vote.

“It is better not to rule than to rule badly,” he said.

The parties reportedly failed to find agreement on issues including tax, the environment, and asylum policies. One sticking point was whether the families of Syrian refugees should be allowed to join them in Germany.

“I will do everything to ensure that this country comes out well through this difficult time,” Merkel said Monday.

Canadians who either live in social housing or are on a waitlist for social housing, and those who live in private housing but struggle to make ends meet will all be eligible for what the government is calling the Canada Housing Benefit (CHB).

Households that meet the “housing need” criteria, will receive an average of $2,500 a year — the government expects 300,000 households to be recipients of this Benefit.

The CHB is just one pillar in a broader National Housing Strategy laid out today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that is the culmination of a year-long municipal, provincial and federal discussion on Canada’s housing affordability crisis.

The Strategy also pledges to cut homelessness by 50 percent over the next 10 years, and build up to 100,000 new affordable homes. The latter policy will be catalysed by a government plan to free up $200 million in surplus federal lands and buildings, that will be then made available to developers of affordable housing at at a small cost, or no cost at all.

“We have to stop thinking about housing as a problem, but more as a solution — it’s the best tool we have to address other significant social challenges,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in an announcement in Toronto late Wednesday afternoon.

The mechanics of Trudeau’s grand housing plan, laid out in very accessible fashion here, will include the creation of a National Co-Investment Housing Fund that will finance the construction of 60,000 new affordable homes, specifically geared towards those fleeing domestic violence, seniors, Indigenous people, and people with mental health issues and disabilities.

“At the end of the day, this strategy is a breakthrough for 1.7 million families who can’t find a decent home they can afford,” said Jenny Gerbasi of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in a statement.

The strategy, however, makes little mention of addressing housing affordability issues for the middle-class in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, many of whom have been priced out of the market, except for a brief paragraph which pledges to “make it easier for self-employed Canadians to get a mortgage.”

No details of how exactly that will take place were mentioned — in fact, come January 2018, a new set of mortgage rules introduced by federal regulators will actually make it much harder for the average Canadian to qualify for a mortgage.

On Wednesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, a one-time attorney for Verizon, officially released his final proposal to repeal the net neutrality regulations enacted under President Obama in 2015. The 210-page document reclassifies broadband internet as a “telecommunications service” instead of as a utility, which would give internet providers near-total control over how their customers get to access the internet. The proposal is on the agenda for the FCC’s December 14 open meeting, where a GOP majority on the commission will vote the new regulations into effect.

Under Pai’s proposal, the FCC would no longer have the authority to make open internet rules for broadband internet providers. Instead, these companies would agree to set of “open internet” principles, and the Federal Trade Commission would enforce violations of these principles. Critics however, say that this new policy would still allow telecoms to mess with internet speeds or build “fast lanes” prioritizing their own services.

Pai has repeatedly called for the introduction of such a “light-touch” regulatory regime, and he gave a litany of reasons for why he’s pushing it through in a Tuesday Wall Street Journal op-ed. A key rationale: net neutrality has disincentivized broadband companies from investing in internet infrastructure, exacerbating the “digital divide” in America between poorer rural areas and better-connected suburbs and cities.","republicancontrolled federal communications commission

Kelley was able to buy the gun because the Air Force didn’t report a prior domestic violence conviction to the FBI as it was supposed to, meaning Kelley’s name wasn’t in a database that alerts gun sellers that a prospective gun buyer has a criminal record. That database, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS for short, has come under scrutiny since the shooting, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions now says he plans to overhaul it.

The background check system has kept guns out of the hands of some 1.3 million people and checks have been run through the system about 230 million times, according to the FBI. But new policies this year saw the system’s database shrunken dramatically, and it’s not clear what effect that will have on its use.

Tens of thousands of people wanted by law enforcement were purged from the system this year after the Federal Bureau of Investigation changed its interpretation of “fugitive from justice” to apply only to alleged criminals who had crossed state lines, according to the Washington Post.","department of justice

Keegan Hamilton,The DEA has officially decided that a notorious fentanyl manufacturer’s synthetic marijuana product is safer and more medically valuable than actual weed.,2017-11-22T19:28:42+00:00,vice-news,"Synthetic THC is safer than actual weed, according to the DEA",https://news.vice.com/story/synthetic-thc-is-safer-than-actual-weed-according-to-the-dea,https://news2-images.vice.com//uploads/2017/11/AP_17308632364730-1024x683.jpg,general,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The DEA has officially decided that a notorious fentanyl manufacturer’s synthetic marijuana product is safer and more medically valuable than actual weed.

In an announcement posted Wednesday in the Federal Register, the DEA announced that the drug Syndros, a liquid form of synthetic THC, will be classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, meaning it can be legally prescribed by doctors. Meanwhile, regular marijuana will continue to be listed alongside heroin in the more restrictive Schedule I category, which is reserved for drugs that have “no currently accepted medical use” and “a high potential for abuse.”

The FDA has already approved Syndros and the DEA’s final scheduling announcement means Syndros has cleared the final regulatory bar on the way to market.

Syndros is made by Insys Therapeutics, an Arizona-based pharma company accused of using dubious marketing practices to sell Subsys, a spray form of the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl approved by the FDA to treat cancer pain. Several former top Insys executives — including John Kapoor, the company’s billionaire founder — have been arrested and charged with bribing doctors and defrauding insurance companies. The company and its ex-leaders also face several lawsuits from states and individuals for allegedly triggering America’s opioid epidemic.

Kapoor, who remains the largest shareholder at Insys, has pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing. He was freed on $1 million bail after his arrest on Oct. 26.

READ: Ex-pharma execs arrested for allegedly bribing doctors to prescribe fentanyl

Earlier this year, new Insys president and CEO Saeed Motahari called the launch of Syndros “a pivotal milestone” for the company. The drug is similar to Marinol, another synthetic THC product previously approved by the FDA to treat anorexia from AIDS or cancer. THC occurs naturally in marijuana, and it’s the main psychoactive component that makes users feel high.

The DEA granted preliminary Schedule II status to Syndros in March and listed it alongside OxyContin, Percocet, cocaine, methamphetamine, and other drugs in the category for substances that have some medical value but “a high potential for abuse.”

Despite that 29 states and Washington, D.C., have now legalized some form of medical marijuana, the DEA and FDA still maintain that marijuana is not medicine. Last year, the FDA rejected a petition to remove marijuana from the Schedule I category due, in part, to studies that showed weed is addictive to monkeys and causes “increased merriment and appetite” in humans, according to documentsobtained last year from the FDA by VICE News.

The DEA noted in its announcement on Wednesday that it received public comments from people opposed to making synthetic THC products Schedule II while keeping marijuana Schedule I. The DEA also said “two commenters expressed concern that pharmaceutical companies are making a profit from approved drugs containing marijuana constituents.”



“The DEA notes that FDA-approved products of oral solutions containing dronabinol [THC] have an approved medical use, whereas marijuana does not have an approved medical use and therefore remains in Schedule I,” the agency said in its response.

While developing its synthetic THC product, Insys has worked to keep real marijuana illegal. The company donated $500,000 last year to the successful campaign to defeat a marijuana legalization ballot initiative in Arizona. Insys said it opposed the measure because it “fails to protect the safety of Arizona’s citizens, and particularly its children.”","arizonabased pharma

It’s easy to get ripped off by a deal that seems too good to be true (it usually is). To save you a few headaches, and a lot of dollars, we’ve compiled some WIRED picks for the best PCs and mobile device deals going on Black Friday weekend, some of which are already available. All of these deals are purchasable online, not in-store. If you insist on trudging through the crowds, we wish you the best, but you won’t find a lot of help here, outside the Black Friday ads linked below.

(Be sure to also check out our main Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals guides for a lot more sales.)

Handpicked WIRED Black Friday Guides:

Our Favorite Laptop, Phone, and Device Deals

Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 ($150 off)

Buy Galaxy S8 (Unlocked) for $575 ($150 off) on Amazon

Buy Galaxy Note 8 (Unlocked) for $800 ($150) on Amazon

The Galaxy S8 and larger Note 8 are two of the best phones this year, and buying Unlocked is the smart way to go. It means that your phone will not be tied exclusively to any one wireless carrier, so if you switch from, say AT&T to T-Mobile, you can use the same phone on your new carrier.

LG G5 32 GB - $199 ($300 off)

Buy on B&H Photo

LG's modular phone system didn't quite work out, but the G5 is still a very decent phone, especially for only $200. What you're getting for the money is a 2016 flagship at 2017 mid-range prices.

Acer E5 15-inch Core i3-7100 Laptop - $299 ($100 off)

Buy on Walmart or Jet

These mid-range Acer laptops are normally a great deal since they include a big, 15-inch HD screen, nice trackpad, and a backlit keyboard. With $100 off its MSRP, this i3 Acer is more than worth the money. What you save on this laptop you can spend on some upgrades, since it's very easy to add RAM and a solid state drive.

Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Laptop ($200-$330 off)

Buy Surface Pro for $330 off on Microsoft’s store

Buy the Surface Laptop w/free Cortana Speaker on Microsoft’s Store

The Surface Pro is the best 2-in-1 tablet you can buy, but it’s expensive. Microsoft is discounting two versions of it with an Intel Core i5 processor. We recommend the one with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. If you want a Surface Laptop (we like it), it will come with a free Cortana-enabled speaker. We can’t vouch for the speaker, but it is a Harman Kardon Invoke.

Huawei Honor 6X Unlocked - $149 ($50 off)

Buy on B&H Photo, Amazon

This affordable phablet gets even better this Thanksgiving weekend thanks to a $50 savings.

Desktop PC Peripherals are 40% off

Buy on Amazon

If you're looking for a new desktop PC, keyboard, monitor, gaming headset, laptop, etc, it might be worth checking out Amazon's PC deals today (Black Friday). Be careful if you've never heard of the brand, but many of the deals are worth checking out if you're in the market.

Amazon Fire HD 10 - $100 ($50 off)

Buy on Amazon

The Fire HD 10 is the most robust Fire tablet that Amazon offers, and at this price, it's hard to pass up. It has a larger, Full HD screen and hands-free Alexa, so you can bark commands from across the room. We recommend you also pick up Amazon's standing case.

Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition - $90 ($40 off)

Buy on Amazon

We picked the Fire HD 8 as our favorite Amazon Fire Kids tablet. It comes with a nice shock-resistant case and some great kid-friendly features. It's high enough quality that you won't hate watching content on it with your kid, either.

Kindle Paperwhite - $90 ($30 off)

Buy on Amazon

The Kindle Paperwhite is the ebook reader to buy. There isn't much competition, and $90 is as good as we've seen the price go for a while. We recommend this Kindle because it has all the essential features, still gets a month of battery life, and and has that nice light-up display.

Anker 13,000mAh Portable Phone Charger - $24 ($20 off)

Buy on Amazon

There’s nothing exciting about buying a portable charger, but if you need one, this is a fantastic one. Anker makes durable, solid accessories and 13,000mAh is enough to charge most phones four times over. It has two high-speed USB 3.0 ports and comes with a charge cord.

Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro - $100 off

Date: Nov. 19

Buy Chromebook Plus for $350 on Samsung.com, Amazon

Buy Chromebook Pro for $450 on Samsung.com, Amazon

Samsung has a bunch of Black Friday deals going, and the Plus and Pro are two good ones. We griped about the problems with Android apps in our Chromebook Pro review, but overall we recommend it. Google continues to improve the app experience, and at $350 - $450, both of these devices are a lot more attractive. We aren’t sure if Amazon will have this deal, but it already has the devices for $50 off.

HP Laptop with 8GB RAM, Intel Core i3, 1TB drive - $300 ($200 off)

Buy on the Microsoft Store

This HP laptop checks most of the boxes for a decent Windows 10 laptop, including having a touchscreen, a decent amount of RAM, and a very good Intel Core i3 processor. HP claims it will get about 8 hours of battery life.

Apple MacBooks and iMacs ($200 off)

Date: Nov. 23-25

Buy the MacBook Air for $800 ($200 off) on Best Buy

Buy the iMac for $900 ($200 off) on Best Buy

Best Buy is the place to be for Apple deals this holiday. During Black Friday, it will discount the MacBook Air and iMac by $200.

Apple Watch Series 1 - $180 ($70 off)

Buy on Target, Macy's

Track and share your activities, and monitor your post-Turkey Day health.

Garmin Vivoactive HR watch - $120 ($130 off)

Date: Nov. 23-25

Buy on Best Buy

No, it's not a phone, but it is a mobile device! This Garmin watch isn’t the sexiest, but like most Garmin’s it’s fantastic for those into fitness or sports, and it’s also more than 50 percent off it’s normal price. If you’re at all interested in a fitness watch, this may be a fun option.

If their old GoPro isn't cutting it any more, give them an upgrade to last year's flagship action cam for only $350. With a rugged, waterproof case, a rear-mounted touchscreen, and signature GoPro modes like super slow-mo and ProTune, this is more than enough camera for most enthusiasts.

Rhett Allain,"Really, Thanksgiving is all about thermal transfer.",2017-11-23T12:00:00Z,wired,Want a Perfect Turkey? Calculate Its Specific Heat Capacity,https://www.wired.com/story/want-a-perfect-turkey-calculate-its-specific-heat-capacity/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a13341daadb2129c427785a/191:100/pass/meat-TAFA.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"As I understand it, the whole point of cooking a turkey is to take it at some temperature and then increase it to a higher temperature. Sure, maybe there's something about family togetherness in there, but really, Thanksgiving is all about thermal transfer. The USDA recommends a minimum internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). I guess this is the minimum temperature to kill all the bad stuff in there—or maybe it is the lowest temperature that it can be and still taste great.

Either way, if you want to increase the temperature of the turkey you need to add energy. Perhaps this energy comes from fire, or an oven or even from hot oil—but it needs energy. But be careful. There is a difference between energy and temperature. Let me give you an example.

Suppose you put some leftover pizza in the oven to heat it up. Since you don't want to make a mess, you just rip off a sheet of aluminum foil and put the pizza on that and then into the oven. The oven is set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit so that after 10 minutes, both the pizza and the foil are probably close to that temperature. Now for the demonstration. You can easily grab the aluminum foil without burning yourself, but you can't do the same to the pizza. Even though these two objects have the same temperature, they have different amounts of thermal energy.

The thermal energy in an object depends on the object's mass, the object's material and the object's temperature. The change in thermal energy for an object then depends on the change in temperature.

In this expression, m is the mass of the object and the variable c is the specific heat capacity. The specific heat capacity is a quantity that tells you how much energy it takes to one gram of the object by 1 degree Celsius. The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 Joules per gram per degree Celsius. For copper, the specific heat capacity is 0.385 J/g/°C (yes, water has a very high specific heat capacity).

But what about turkey? What is the energy needed to heat up 1 gram of turkey by 1°C? That is the question I want to answer. Oh sure, I could probably just do a quick search online for this answer, but that's no fun. Instead I want to calculate this myself.

Here is the basic experimental setup. I am going to take a turkey breast (because I am too impatient to use the whole turkey) and put it in a known amount of hot water. I will then record the change in temperature of the water and the change in temperature of the turkey. Of course, this will have to be in an insulated container such that all of the energy that leaves the water will go into the turkey.

With the change in temperature of the water, I can calculate (based on the known specific heat capacity of water) the energy lost. Assuming all this energy goes into the turkey, I will then know the increase in energy of the turkey. With the mass and change in turkey temperature, I will have the specific heat capacity of a turkey.

Just to be clear, I can set the changes in energy to be opposite from each other and then solve for the specific heat capacity of the turkey. Like this.

OK, it's experiment time. I am going to start with 2,000 mL (2 kilograms) of hot water and add it to a foam box with my turkey breast. I will monitor both the temperature of the water and the turkey. Oh, the turkey has a mass of 1.1 kilograms. Here's what this looks like (without the box lid).

I collected data for quite a while and I assumed that the water and the turkey would reach an equilibrium temperature—but I was wrong. Apparently it takes quite a significant amount of time for this turkey to heat up. Still, the data should be good enough for a calculation.

Hopefully it's clear that the red curve is the hot water and the blue is for the turkey. From this plot, the water had a change in temperature of -21.7°C and the turkey had +27°C. Putting these values along with the mass of the water and turkey, I get a turkey specific heat capacity of 6.018 J/g/°C. That's a little bit higher than what I was expecting—but at least it is in the ballpark of the value for water. But overall, I'm pretty happy.

But what can you do with the specific heat capacity for a turkey? What if you want to do a type of sous-vide cooking in which the turkey is placed in a vacuum-sealed bag and then added water at a particular temperature? Normally, the temperature of the water is kept at some constant temperature. But what if you want to start with hot water and cold turkey and then end up with perfect temperature turkey? In order to do this, you could calculate the starting mass and temperature of water that would give you the best ending turkey temperature. I will let you do this as a homework assignment.

Of course there is another way to cook a turkey. You could drop it from some great height such that it heats up when it lands. Oh, wait—I already did this calculation.","temperature

Nick Stockton,"Every year-and-a-half or so, a bunch of hardcore space engineers meet in Tennessee to figure out how to get humanity to the stars.",2016-04-12T16:00:12Z,wired,The Far-Out Summit Where Geniuses Learn to Build Starships,https://www.wired.com/2016/04/far-meeting-rocket-scientists-learn-space/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5927114caf95806129f5185c/191:100/pass/Torus_Interior_AC75-2621_5718.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"To get to the spaceship convention I have to go to Chattanooga. To a former train depot once called Terminal Station, a beaux-arts building downtown, which was built in a time when trains were the apex of industry—the smartest, fastest, most high-tech way to move through space—and when stations were elegant ports of call. It has a soaring dome, and the bathrooms are naturally lit through stained glass.

Terminal Station closed in 1970, not quite a year after Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. The building reopened in 1973, four months after the Apollo program ended, as the Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel. The new owners put a neon train on the roof, the concourse beneath the freestanding dome became a lobby, and the baggage room became a dining hall. Passenger cars were moored to the rails and refurbished as luxury suites. The iron horse engine became a thing for guests to climb aboard for selfies. The outbuildings and rail yards sprouted a gift shop, a pizza parlor, a comedy club, an indoor jungle-themed swimming pool, and an outdoor doughnut-shaped swimming pool, among other things.

Chattanooga is not quite the regional transportation hub it was in the latter golden age of rail travel, and in fact these days is kind of a pain in the ass to get to. So after 12 hours of planes, delays, and courtesy shuttles, I drop my baggage in my room and go looking for a drink.

Joey O'Loughlin

The spaceship convention mostly happens in the drab convention center adjacent to the Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel. But the hospitality suite is at the end of a long and—to my eyes—superlatively Southern garden in what used to be the rail yard. Arriving late, I almost walk right by, except this giant logo catches my eye. It is a giant spaceship and star swoosh—aesthetically similar to an Apollo-era mission patch—printed on a freestanding cardboard poster on a buffet table inside the suite. I can see it through parted curtains; I also see people mingling. And, are those people holding alcoholic beverages?

Yes they are. “Have you ever seen an Alpha Centauri sunrise?” says Robert Kennedy III, standing near the door with two other men also named Robert. I assumed Kennedy III was talking about the triple star system closest to our own solar system. Based on proximity alone, the system is a prime candidate for humanity’s first interstellar trip and therefore a conversational topic one would not be surprised to wander into at the spaceship convention. Nope. Kennedy III is trying to offer me a cocktail—specifically the peach-colored thing he and the other Roberts are drinking from clear plastic cups.

The only Alpha Centauri sunrise I will ever see is a peach-colored cocktail made with moonshine and Red Bull.

In the kitchenette Kennedy III spins the lid off a jar of moonshine—Tennessee, right?—and then adds orange juice, grenadine, and (try not to make a face) Red Bull. He is a good conversationalist, partly because he grins while he talks, partly because he engages by angling his forehead like he is peeking at you over an invisible pair of spectacles. Mostly though, Kennedy III is good at threading the conversation with fun topics, like the history of distillation, stellar luminance, and Greek mythology. The drink, he says in a fourth-wall-breaking sotto voce, is a pun. Centaur means “horse person,” but the name has the word taur in it, which is Greek for—Kennedy pauses to make a horn symbol with his pinkie and forefinger—The Bull.

Kennedy III is also a heavy pour. Which means I am up far later and drinking much more than I had planned, given that tomorrow’s marathon of rocket talks begins at 8 am.

This is not a spaceship convention in the way you are probably thinking. I invented that name as shorthand to explain to people why I was going to Chattanooga. This is the Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop. Nobody is actually building a spaceship. But they are talking about it.

Joey O'Loughlin

Kennedy III is one of TVIW’s cofounders, and he describes the meeting as a place for reality-based discussions about technologies that will help humans reach other star systems. “Reality-based” means do not bring your warp drives, your wormholes, your bullshit equations that let you skip through the universe on theoretical physics. If you want to talk propulsion, keep it sub-bullshit. Do bring your: latest idea for mining rocket fuel from asteroids; proposal for gigantic solar-powered orbital lasers; thermodynamic equations for making it rain inside a starship.

This is the fourth (non-annual) TVIW, and its theme is “From Iron Horse to Worldship.” Choo Choo! Get it? But that construction also illustrates the scope of technological challenge. As another TVIW cofounder—NASA physicist Les Johnson—put it, the mothballed locomotive in the Choo Choo’s backyard is better equipped for steaming to Tokyo than a modern rocket is for interstellar travel.

Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light years away. At current technological levels it’d take a spaceship from Earth 30,000 years to see a real Alpha Centauri sunrise. Three hundred centuries is a significant chunk of the sum total of human history, the vintage of some of the oldest cave paintings.

Figuring out how to shorten that flight time is why people come to TVIW. And most do not come from too far. The Tennessee Valley is chock-full of people interested in space. It contains Oak Ridge National Lab (nuclear geeks), Marshall Space Flight Center (rocket geeks), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (engineering geeks). Plus plenty of other geeks to fill the spaces between.

There are nuclear geeks from Oak Ridge, rocket geeks from Marshall Space Flight Center, and engineering geeks from the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Most are pragmatic about the realities of interstellar travel: Odds are, nobody here lives to see it. This could have something to do with demographics. People in the aforementioned professions tend to have institutional mindsets, and they are accustomed to starting big projects that some other generation will finish. Even the sizable contingent of science fiction writers at TVIW seem pretty clear-eyed about the difficulties of interstellar travel (though to be fair, several of the science fiction writers are engineers or physicists).

Strictly, a spaceship convention this is not. But it is as close as you are going to find in 2016: a professional, intense, inclusive-but-nerdy meeting not of big-talk entrepreneurs but of real-talk rocket-builders. These are the people who will figure out how to get human beings out of the solar system, if anyone can.

Philip Lubin/University of California/NASA

Must Go Faster

Even the most committed NASA lifer has no taste for interstellar missions with a duration longer than recorded human history. Spaceships need to get faster.

But propulsion talks are very boring. Because again, this is not wrinkle-in-spacetime, dilithium crystal, punch-it-Chewie magic. Sub-bullshit propulsion—be it an Atlas rocket, fusion, matter-antimatter annihilation, or laser beam—is always the same thing: Force goes one way, spaceship goes the other. A change in velocity: delta V. As one engineer told me repeatedly, everything is about delta-freaking-vee.

(Obviously, the people who come to TVIW do not think propulsion talks are boring. They stay up until well past midnight talking about propulsion, then wake up by 8 am to watch hours of PowerPoint about sub-bullshit propulsion and delta-freaking-vee. But if you were not at the Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel in early March, I assume you are like most of the people I’ve spoken to since—who perk up when I mention spaceship convention but give me an oh, cool, but not really nod the second I start talking about delta-freaking-vee. [Conversely, if you thought, “Hey, I love delta-freaking-vee, where can I learn more?” the answer is TVIW’s YouTube channel.])

Philip Lubin, a UC Santa Barbara physicist, begins his plenary talk—“Roadmap to Interstellar Flight”—by announcing that he rarely goes to these kinds of conferences “because they are too far on the imaginary axis for me.” But Lubin has a plan for launching vehicles from Earth that would reach Alpha Centauri not in 30,000 years but in 20.

Here’s what you need: an orbital laser, a small satellite equipped with a square meter of reflective sail, and the sun. Superefficient solar panels power the laser, which can fire the equivalent of about one-eighth the amount of electricity the US consumes each year. That dense stream of photons creates enough pressure against the sail to accelerate the craft to 100 million miles per hour—one fifth the speed of light.

Which at first sounds pretty bullshitty. Laser sails? But nobody in this lecture hall full of no-bullshitters snorts. So keep listening: A single photon exerts an infinitesimal amount of force. Can’t get much much delta-vee from that. But a lot of photons pushing against a very tiny spacecraft? That will give you a whole hell of a lot of delta-freaking-vee. Which is why Lubin spends a lot of his stage time talking about Moore’s law, the exponential rate at which computers get simultaneously faster and cheaper over time. His plan requires fully functioning satellites—processors, camera, nav, comms, and even a tiny propulsion unit for course adjustments—weighing less than a gram.

Oh, and a really big laser. Throttling a wafersat up to 100 million miles per hour will take a 100-gigawatt laser array. Or, for the no-bullshit, build-it-with-today’s-technology—by strapping together 100 million 1-kilowatt lasers.

The plan has technical hurdles. During the Q&A after the talk, astrophysicist (and third TVIW cofounder) Greg Matloff raises objections about how the Doppler effect will sap photons’ propulsive force. But for the most part, the plan uses existing or close-enough technology and is therefore very non-bullshit until you start talking price.

A 1-kilowatt laser retails for about $70. Even if you get the bulk discount for buying 100 million of them, you still have to put them in orbit. Current launch rate is about $3,000 a pound. Also, the solar panels that will power the thing are very expensive (and heavy). The whole apparatus could be anywhere from three to 10 square miles across. For comparison, the International Space Station is slightly bigger than a football field.

Lubin’s talk pisses off a lot of people. He’s up there onstage, basically telling them their ideas for fusion, matter-antimatter, and whatever else are too expensive, too slow, and too imaginary for interstellar travel in this lifetime. Oh, also, don’t bother building a worldship or whatever, because the human body is 99 percent wasted mass. Sorry.

Joey O'Loughlin

But then, a little more than a month after the TVIW talk, Russian billionaire Yuri Milner announces that he plans to seed Lubin’s idea with $100 million. That’s not Apollo money—$200 billion in 2016 dollars—but Milner also scales back some of Lubin’s ideas. (He grounds the laser, eliminating a lot of the launch costs). Milner tells me he expects the $100 million will buy the project a proof-of-concept. The complete 100-million-mph mission to Alpha Centauri will likely cost between $5 billion (one Large Hadron Collider) and $10 billion (A James Webb Space Telescope plus two New Horizons).

If you want to send people to space, propulsion is the least of your problems. It's not as hard as food, water, and not catching space madness.

Again, that is for a mission with no people. The price tag for a crewed mission to the stars is Apollo squared. Maybe even cubed. Who knows. But despite Lubin’s ambivalence toward crewed interstellar flight and Milner’s low investment relative to the goal, this proof-of-concept pushes the humans a little bit closer toward being an interstellar species.

And if you are talking about people, propulsion is probably the easiest problem to solve, spacewise. Even if your sub-bullshit interstellar engine runs on nuclear fusion (which no one knows how to build) fueled by helium-3 from Jupiter’s atmosphere (which no one knows how to harvest), learning how to create such a thing is still not as hard as feeding, hydrating, protecting from radiation, keeping sane, and otherwise keeping healthy multiple generations of human beings. But that’s what you have to do if you’re using a sub-bullshit engine to go to another star.

Michel Lamontagne

The Worldship

Imagine a rod over 9 miles long, maybe a quarter-mile wide. Now put 12 rings around it, each 3 miles in diameter, attached to the central rod with spokes. Spin the wheels to simulate gravity. That’s a generation ship, designed to spend hundreds or thousands of years traveling between star systems. A worldship.

There’s a picture of that one taped to a wall in a meeting room at the Chattanooga Choo Choo’s convention center. The room is temporary headquarters for the Worldship Working Track, an effort to add a little bit of variety to TVIW’s propulsion-heavy diet. The dozen and a half worldshippers are split into two subgroups, each gathered around their own round banquet tables covered with laptops, spiral notebooks, elbows, and soda cans.

On a large, easeled, tearaway pad in the middle of the room, somebody on the worldship team has drawn a color-coded cross section of the rings. From outside in: a one-meter-thick structural shell; three meters of two-phase water to shield against radiation; varying thicknesses of substrate, rock, and soil; 500-meter air gap; clear ceiling; and about 2 kilometers of vacuum between the ceiling and central hub.

Michel Lamontagne

The climate subgroup of worldshippers is huddled over a single laptop, working on the rain problem. A French-Canadian engineer named Michel Lamontagne tells me planet Earth has the best plumbing system in the universe. Solar energy heats moisture, moisture rises, cools, condenses, falls, wash, rinse, repeat. Figuring out the thermodynamics of cloud formation is a pain in the ass, but way more reliable in the long run. No pipes to clog, filters to foul, screws to strip, vents to dent, valves to rust. Maintenance is not just a hassle; any mission-critical system with an abundance of moving parts is bound to fail—critically—at some stage of a multigenerational interstellar mission. Plus, rain helps keep the dust down.

Worldship passengers: cockroaches, dogs, Maine coon cats, rats, crickets, and tarantulas. But nothing from Australia. Everything there wants to kill you.

How much energy does moist ground need for evaporation to occur? On Earth, insolation is about 1200 watts per square meter, Lamontagne says.

“Actually, 164 watts per square meter is the day/night average for Earth’s energy,” says Geoffrey Landis, a NASA physicist (and science fiction writer).

“Wait,” Landis says. “Actually, the Earth’s surface is convex, so it doesn’t absorb as much heat.” The worldship’s rings will be concave, meaning energy absorption will be a lot higher. So for now, they figure, 240 watts per square meter.

The subgroup around the other table is figuring out life: flora, fauna, and the nutrient cycles that sustain them. This group is more crowded, but quieter. Three are working out the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous cycles. Each of the remaining has been assigned a batch of plants and animals by an evolutionary biologist from Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital named Cassidy Cobbs. She is the group’s Noah.

Mosquitoes, no; cockroaches, yes. Wolves, no; dogs, yes. Rats, crickets, tarantulas: yes, yes, yes. Except no tarantulas from Australia. In fact, most of Australia is right out, doomed to remain Earthbound with everything else too venomous, fanged, large, or aggressive. “The top predator is a Maine Coon cat,” Cobbs says. Crops are exactly what you would expect: grains, legumes, tubers, brassicas, lettuces, and nightshades.

I peek over Cobbs’ shoulder at her master list and freak out a little bit. It includes neither cacao nor coffee plants. Who the hell would want to jump on a spaceship without coffee and chocolate? Later, in the hospitality suite, I corner one of Cobbs’ team members and ask her: What the hell?

“We discussed both crops,” Ashleigh Hughes, a high school student, assures me. Both plants could grow along a ring’s elevated ridges, so long as that ring has a tropical climate.

Joey O'Loughlin

The table next to the biology group is unpeopled, covered with backpacks, open laptops, and a few books. Including a copy of Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel Aurora. Which I find a little bit surprising, given (no spoilers) Robinson’s book about a worldship trip to the Tau Ceti system portrays interstellar missions as dismal and doomed.

Science fiction and space culture enjoy a mutualistic relationship. During presentations, speakers often preface digressions with phases like “This next bit would be a cool idea for any science fiction writers in the audience to play with …” Every physicist, engineer, and enthusiast I spoke to said their career had been, and still is, inspired by books, TV shows, movies, comics about space travel. The physicist Les Johnson, who MC’d the talks, is deputy director of NASA’s Advanced Concepts Office, principal investigator of a solar-sailed probe set to explore an asteroid in 2018, and, yes, a sci-fi writer. He told me science fiction is part escapism, part aspiration, and part inspiration, bringing broader acceptance to the dream of exploring the stars. Preach.

(I should add that not everybody agrees with this notion of science fiction as an aspirational genre. My editor sees science fiction as primarily a fantastical lens for writers to comment on contemporary society. I posed this alternative hypothesis to science fiction author Jack McDevitt, who counterposited that my editor must have been an English major.)

NASA Ames Research Center

It will cost how much?

One night I asked a table full of engineers if they could foresee an inflection point when the relatively flat line of space funding would start arcing into a trajectory that could fund human interstellar flight. This group, which earlier had been holding a graduate-level discussion on the combustive properties of superchilled rocket fuel, basically shrugged. Maybe if there was an impending asteroid strike?

Finally, a retired nuclear engineer sitting across the table uncrossed his arms and growled. “Let us make the assumption that we do go into space and build a habitat. If you go back in time from that point and look at a line leading back to the present, we are currently so close to zero that they won’t know where to start the graph,” he says. “$20 billion, $50 billion a year is so far down the graph that it’s almost in the noise. We have to somehow generate ourselves off the zero point.”

No one knows what it'll take to convince human beings to pay for space.

Robert Kennedy III has thought a lot about this inflection point. He says it will come from a societal change, when a critical mass of people commit themselves to a sustained, multigeneration, self-perpetuating institution committed to the cause. Something like the Catholic Church, or maybe because this is an engineering problem, the Dutch dike builders.

Joey O'Loughlin

Kennedy III was born in Staten Island and spent his college years in California preparing for the Cold War to become a hot war (he still carries a nuclear effects calculator in his right breast pocket). After stints building robots that work in nuclear reactors, writing computer code, and advising the US House of Representatives on space, he wound up in Oak Ridge, where he consults large renewable energy projects like an Ethiopian geothermal tap. He also owns a business that publishes media on Russian space technology.

One of Kennedy III’s coauthored geoengineering ideas—a brute-force fix to global warming that involves installing a gigantic shade at the Lagrange point between Earth and the sun—got him an invitation to the the International Association of Astronautics Symposium of Realistic Near-Term Advanced Scientific Space Missions. Doesn’t matter; point is, it was a conference in the Italian Alps. The crowd loved the presentation and especially applauded the plan’s practicality. (Practicality among engineers typically refers to the soundness of the underlying engineering, not cost or logistics).

After his talk, Kennedy III was standing on a hotel balcony with Les Johnson and astrophysicist Greg Matloff from the New York City College of Technology. They hit upon this idea of a practical, grounded space community based in the Tennessee Valley, and scheduled the first meeting. They have been meeting every 18 months or so since. The group takes the practicality thing seriously and submits its projects (such as the worldship) to peer-reviewed publications like the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society.

So they do not become a ghetto of insular rocket dweebs, Kennedy III tries to invite younger people, and people from other disciplines—biologists, chemists, philosophers. “Various subcultures who want to get into space, they might do some original thinking on their own, but then what? What’s their next step?” Kennedy III says. “If you want to actually do something you have to generate a consensus.”

One very early morning, or night, or, whatever, it is 2 am in the hospitality suite and Kennedy III is trying to explain the origins of TVIW over the sound of two guys playing space-themed country songs on acoustic guitar (“She’s Nothing But Trouble, She’s Just Like Tea-Teb""). Anyway, space culture can be sectarian, or it has been in the past, says Kennedy III. Just about every space group from the 1960s onward has been reaching for the heavens. Their ideologies might have differed. Like, space should be free from the government, so let’s cut NASA out of the deal. Or, space should be for whoever can get there first, so let’s help out the Soviets. Or, space should be for those who deserve it, so let’s build a Randian refuge up in Lagrange Point 5. The groups form and schism, and never really get anywhere. TVIW is trying to stay outside all of that. They just want to go to space.

No-Go for Liftoff

The evening of the Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop’s opening reception, attendees gather around a projection TV in the corner of a hotel party hall to watch a SpaceX launch livestream.

Customary silence at the one minute mark, then the 10-second countdown, and then the top-down camera angle shows a series of fiery bursts. Before I can begin holding my breath for liftoff, a space enthusiast in the back of the room named Lorraine Glenn pipes up. “That doesn’t look good. That does not look good. That’s three in a row,"" and the room collectively sighs. The chatter comes back up, and even as I am still thinking this launch looks promising, the guy next to me explains that the launch is cancelled, probably because SpaceX couldn’t get their oxygen chilled properly. But he can’t be sure, so don’t quote him on the record.

Except he was right. No-go for liftoff. Problem with the liquid oxygen. Space: still hard.

Joey O'Loughlin

And the next morning I am up by 7 am and eat a mountain of Southern breakfast and hustle to the big lecture hall for the 8 am opening remarks. Johnson gets up onstage and gives his customary disclaimer. Yes, he is an employee of NASA, but today he is here as a private citizen and space enthusiast who took vacation from his job to attend.

He stands in behind a podium decorated with the Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop star-and-rocket swoosh logo and gives a shout out to the Valley Conservancy of Huntsville, Alabama, whose performance of the Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop orchestral theme music had been playing just before he took the stage.

Then he thanks the volunteers and points out that even they did not get a free ride to the TVIW, because this is a labor of love. People’s chairs squeak because they are nodding along or maybe just reaching for their coffee mugs, but either way Johnson is on message. This is a room of people dedicated to a better future for our species and our planet, and he is so proud to be a part of what is contributing to that. It is all a part of the bigger goal: to be, simply, a footnote.

That is all most of these people want, really. Forget even being retconned into the decor like the trains next door. They just want to be in the references, a TVIW journal article buried in the citations of a boring history of a human colony on a distant planet, circling a distant star.

But if you’re interested in a different way of getting around, have time to spend, and don’t want to do the whole cruise or road trip thing, you need a train.

We’re not talking about Amtrak. We’re talking about a sort of old-world technology, which also happens to be a terrific way to see some of the world’s most majestic sites and scenery.

To get you started, we’ve selected some of the best train trips on the planet. Consider the Hiram Bingham that climbs the Inca Trail to Machu Pichu, or the Glacier Express that carves through the Swiss Alps. See Canada’s wilderness from the Rocky Mountaineer, or play the tsar and roll through Russia and China in style.","hiram bingham

A number of retailers will offer the Xbox One S for $190 on Black Friday. This is a very low price, and unless you have a 4K TV with HDR, there’s no reason to get a One X over a One S this holiday. Microsoft’s Store has the best deal of the bunch. It includes a free game and one month Game Pass.

Razer Mano'war Gaming Headset - $119 ($50 off)

Buy on Razer

Razer's award-winning wireless gaming headset for the PC is at a discount for Black Friday. PC/Mac/PS4 only. Sorry Xbox fans.

1 Year of PlayStation Plus - $40 ($20 off)

If you own a PS4, you need PS Plus to play online. It also gives you access to a few free games each month. This is an easy way to save a few bucks.

Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers Bundle - $350 ($50 off)

Buy on Amazon

The Rift keeps getting cheaper, and that's a great thing for anyone who wants to try out VR. If you're thinking of buying into high-end VR this year on your PC, the Rift likely won't get cheaper.

PS4 and Xbox One Controllers - $40 ($20 off)

Date: Nov. 23-24

Buy PS4 Controllers on Amazon, Best Buy (Crystal Red), Walmart

Buy Xbox One Controllers on Amazon, Microsoft Store

PS4 controllers seem like they run out of juice every day or two, and they always cost at least $60 to replace. If you’re in need, most Sony DualShock controller colors will be $40 all week, and Microsoft is discounting many versions of its Xbox One controller to match. Oddly enough, leading up to Black Friday, both companies are already discounting their controllers. Best Buy and Walmart have some new exclusive DualShock colors, as well.

PlayStation VR headset with Skyrim VR - $350 ($100 off)

Date: Nov. 22-27

Buy on Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target

Sony’s PlayStation VR headset (read WIRED’s review) works with any PS4, and it’s finally coming down in price. This bundle comes with a special version of Skyrim, two motion controllers, the headset, and camera.

B&H Photo has a similar PSVR bundle with PlayStation Worlds, if the Skyrim version sells out.

Nintendo Switch Console - $300 (Hard to find)

Buy on Amazon

It's not on discount, but if you hope to get a Nintendo Switch in time for Christmas or another holiday, we highly recommend you order it now. Amazon is currently out of stock, but is still accepting orders and Nintendo is ramping up availability over the holidays.

Nintendo Switch Travel Case - $8 ($22 off)

Buy on Amazon

If you own a Nintendo Switch, you should get a case for it. It's screen will scratch if you're not careful. This travel case is perfect for packing in your luggage.

Game Deals

Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle for Nintendo Switch - $48 ($12 off)

Buy on Amazon

You wouldn't think that a game filled with Ubisoft's annoying Rabbids would be fun, but you'd be wrong. This is a fun and utterly absurd Mario crossover collaboration that is worth picking up.

Madden 18 - $30 ($30 off)

Buy on Amazon and Jet.

This year's new Madden game is already half-off in physical and download form.

FIFA 18 - $30 ($30 off)

Buy on Amazon, Jet.

Prefer football to American football? FIFA 18 is also half-off right now.

Civilization VI - $30 ($30 off)

Buy for Mac on Amazon

Buy for Windows on Amazon

Sid Meier's Civilization is one of the defining gaming series since the dawn of the PC gaming era, and it's better than ever. This installment is the newest and got near universal praise upon its release.

Destiny 2 - $30 ($30 off)

Buy on Walmart

Destiny 2 improves on a lot of the issues players had with the first Destiny and at $30, it’s very affordable for a relatively new game. Developer Bungie continues to fill the game with new content on a regular basis, as well.

Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Explorer’s Edition - $60

Buy on Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Walmart ($10 off)

Breath of the Wild is a serious candidate for Game of the Year, and one of the best reasons to buy a Nintendo Switch (which is actually in stock at Amazon for once). This special version comes with a special two-sided map of Hyrule and an Explorer’s Guide with extra lore and fun info about the game.

Overwatch Game of the Year Edition - $30 ($30 off)

Buy on Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart

Overwatch is one of the few multiplayer games that’s held interest for a year and a half now, and shows no signs of losing its community yet. With more maps and more characters, it’s better than ever.

Doom - $15 ($15 off)

Buy on Amazon, Best Buy

Doom is scary and twisted, but also a very fun single player game with some solid multiplayer components. At $15, it’s hard to pass up.","crystal red walmart

Handpicked WIRED Black Friday Guides:

Our Favorite Headphone Deals

Sennheiser HD 6XX - $200 ($150 off)

Buy on Massdrop

Sennheiser's HD600 series cans are an easy pick for any budding audiophile, but Massdrop's custom Senny headphones are a steal for $150 less.

Skullcandy Uproar Wireless Headphones - $25 ($25 off)

Date: Available Now

Buy on Walmart, Amazon

These wireless headphones won’t redefine audio, but they’re a bargain at $25. They have great reviews and should give you a great all-around sound without breaking the bank.

RHA MA600i Noise Isolating Earbuds With Remote and Microphone - $40 ($50 off)

Buy on Amazon

These silicone-tipped in-ear headphones might not be wireless, but they're designed to isolate noise and provide clear sound.

Bose QuietComfort 25 - $179 ($100 off)

Buy on Amazon and Microsoft Store

At $179, this almost qualifies as a stocking stuffer from one of the undisputed noise-canceling kings. Know anyone who needs a break from the constant family socializing? Give them the gift of sweet, sweet silence.

Our Favorite Wireless Speaker Deals

Alexa Tap - $80 ($50 off)

Buy on Amazon

This is an amazing price on an Alexa-enabled speaker that you can take with you everywhere.

Google Home - $79 ($50 off)

Buy on Walmart

Google's first home assistant device is on deep discount, putting it well below $100. This functions as a handy aid around the home, but also has a nice speaker inside to pump up the jams.

Harman Kardon Invoke - $100 ($100 off)

Date: Available Now

Buy on Best Buy, Harman Kardon, Microsoft

Microsoft enters the smarthome speaker and virtual assistant game with the Invoke. It has better sound quality than most other smarthome speakers and plays well with your familiar friend from Windows, Cortana.

Amazon Echo Show - $180 ($50 off)

Buy on Best Buy, Amazon

The Echo Show is basically another Alexa speaker, but with a 7-inch screen on it.

Amazon Echo Dot - $30 ($20 off)

Buy on Amazon, Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond

Toss your Echo and Echo Show out the window (okay, don't actually do that) and replace it with the small, discreet Echo Dot.

UE Boom 2 - $80 ($120 off)

Buy on Best Buy

Yes, we love the Blast and Megablast, but the Boom 2 is still one of our favorite speakers and this is a positively unbelievable price.

UE Megaboom - $170 ($130 off)

Date: Available Now

Buy on Best Buy

Okay, it may seem nonsensical to buy this version of UE's insanely popular, portable, shockproof, and waterproof Bluetooth speakers when their new Wi-Fi-enabled and Alexa-compatible line debuted barely a month ago. But this is still one of our favorite picks and retains the ""Double Up"" feature that allows you to sync up with multiple speakers, which the new Blast line currently does not. So there.

Sonos Speakers - ($25 - $100 off)

Date: Nov. 23-27

Buy Sonos One for $175 ($25 off) on Sonos, Amazon

Buy Sonos Play:1 for $150 ($50 off) on Sonos, Amazon

Buy Sonos Playbar for $600 ($100 off) on Sonos, Amazon

Buy Sonos Playbase for $600 ($100 off) on Sonos, Amazon

Sonos is discounting quite a few of its speakers over Thanksgiving weekend. We highly recommend the Sonos One because it has Alexa support, as well as the Play:5, Sonos Playbar, and Sub. If you really don’t care about Alexa, the Play:1 is also available and the Playbase, which is great if you want your soundbar to sit below your TV (though the Playbar sounds nicer).

Other Audio Goodies

Blue Yeti USB Microphone

Buy on Amazon

We've seen better deals on this microphone elsewhere, but it's sold out. This is the second-best price on a very nice microphone.

Audio Technica Turntable with USB - $229 ($70 off)

Buy on B&H Photo

If you wanted to get into vinyl, make 2018 your year to jam out! This high-quality Audio Technica is aimed at DJs and home Hi-Fi users alike.

Audio Technica Turntable with Bluetooth - $149 ($30 off)

Buy on Jet

This affordable turntable lets you stream your vinyl directly to wireless headphones or speakers, which kind of defeats the purpose of listening to vinyl, but this is a nice discount anyway.

Google Home Mini - $29 ($20 off)

Date: Nov. 24

Buy on Walmart

Google's latest and tiniest helper device is small enough to put in every room, whether you want to control Spotify in the kitchen or find out the weather in your bedroom. On Black Friday, it will be affordable enough to buy several.

"Jason Parham,Emma Grey Ellis,Peter Rubin,Brian Raftery,Angela Watercutter",Looking to avoid your family and don't like football? These flicks will get you through your turkey hangover.,2017-11-23T14:00:00Z,wired,11 Streaming Thanksgiving Movies to Queue Up After Your Meal,https://www.wired.com/story/best-thanksgiving-streaming-movies/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a14e91c61502d203c9d166d/191:100/pass/HolidayFilms-DXKK36.jpg,technology,2017-11-24 00:34:00.129124,"The only Thanksgiving tradition more prevalent than turkey and stuffing is falling asleep in front of the TV as soon as dinner is over. (Just us? Oh, OK.) But falling asleep watching what? For a lot of folks it's sports, for others it's the NFL (zing!)—but once the food coma starts to hit, classic Turkey Day-themed movies are where it's at. Movies like Planes, Trains & Automobiles are time-honored staples, but everyone has their deep cuts, too. Looking for something to watch as you process the tryptophan? Gobble these movies up.

Big (1988)

If Thanksgiving planning proves too stressful this year, you might want to consider its lesser-known companion holiday: T.Hanksgiving, in which everyone gathers to watch the best Tom Hanks movies, while eating nothing but french fries (in honor, of course, of Hanks' yo-yo-diet cravings during the filming of Cast Away). And while there's a long list of family-friendly Hanks-a-million titles to choose from—like the breezy retro-romp That Thing You Do! or the sleek caper Catch Me If You Can—your best bet is this 1988 body-shifting comedy, in which a fortune-telling Zoltar machine transforms a wistful pre-teen into an excitable 30-year-old. Big finds Hanks at his '80s-charmer peak, his performance a mix of verve and earnesty that captures the whipsawing joy of childhood (and adulthood, for that matter). It's a movie that will likely charm everyone in the family, and perfect conversational fodder as you chew that thing you chew. — Brian RafteryWhere to stream it: Amazon, iTunes, YouTube

The Big Chill (1983)

There’s never really a bad time to watch The Big Chill, but holidays—the times folks spend around family, biological or chosen—are the best. Written and directed by Star Wars scribe Lawrence Kasdan, this 1980s classic perfectly encapsulates what it’s like to reunite and reconnect with college friends after a few years of real adulthood. And even though it focuses on a clique that gets back together after the funeral of a mutual pal, it never gets too sentimental, or too cheesy. Wonderful chemistry, an A+ soundtrack, and Jeff Goldblum—The Big Chill has everything you want to enjoy while on your third piece of pumpkin pie. —Angela WatercutterWhere to stream it: Amazon, iTunes, YouTube

Four Brothers (2005)

By the time director John Singleton made Four Brothers in 2005, he’d already augured three formidable classics into theaters: there was the insurgent Boyz N the Hood, the Janet Jackson-led Poetic Justice, and college-campus race fable Higher Learning. The knot that ties each of those films together is also what makes Four Brothers, his Detroit western about the bonds of kinship, such a satisfying watch. Singleton has always had a particular eye for urban noirs, a particular taste for expanding the breadth of marginalized stories, and Four Brothers (in one of Outkast's Andre Benjamin’s first starring roles) unfolds with the kind of redemptively entertaining grit only a mid-aughts crime thriller could capture. —Jason ParhamWhere to stream it: Amazon, iTunes, YouTube

Grumpy Old Men (1993)

There will never be another actor like Walter Matthau. Somehow, a gangly hangdog managed to harness the anything-goes weirdness of the ’60s and ’70s to star in rom-coms (Cactus Flower) and neo-noirs (Charley Varrick) alike. By the time he reunited with his Odd Couple counterpart Jack Lemmon for this crusty, crabby goofball, though the only thing Gen-Xers really knew him for was The Bad News Bears—meaning the cool crowd dismissed it like it was a credulous reporter calling Sub Pop. Regardless, I defy you to watch this and not howl for 104 minutes. Walter Matthau is a goddamn treasure. This movie is also one. Get over yourself and enjoy them both. —Peter RubinWhere to stream it: HBO Go

Home for the Holidays (1995)

Honestly, sometimes I can’t tell if this is a good movie or just a perfect time capsule of the mid-1990s film world that I can’t resist swallowing. It’s directed by Jodie Foster and stars a pre-Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. and a fresh-off-My-So-Called-Life Claire Danes. But more importantly it has Holly Hunter at her relatable, hilarious best as a struggling woman who just lost her job and now has to go deal with relatives. Full of that loosely plotted, we-made-this-for-the-cost-of-a-Biggie-Smalls-video vibe that you just don’t that much any more, Home for the Holidays is ten times better than actually being home at the holidays. And there’s turkey, too. —Angela WatercutterWhere to stream it: HBO Go

North By Northwest (1959)

Roger Thornhill (played by ‘50s George Clooney, Cary Grant) is a distinctly un-suave ad man is mistaken for a government agent by a troupe of foreign spies. After they attempt to whack him and then frame him for murder, Thornhill has to hightail it from cops and spooks alike. It’s one of Hitchcock’s best: There’s plane chases, a sassy Eva Marie Saint, and (duh) suspense. OK, so calling it a Thanksgiving movie is kind of a stretch—a newspaper date tells us that some of the action must have taken place on Turkey Day, but Cary Grant never eats or mentions any—but really, what’s more American than dangling off the face(s) of Mount Rushmore? —Emma Grey EllisWhere to stream it: Amazon, iTunes

Planes, Trains & Automobiles* (1987)

For reference, these are the four movies John Hughes directed prior to this John Candy-Steve Martin buddy-out-of-water flick: Sixteen Candles; The Breakfast Club; Weird Science; Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In other words, Hughes was just about unstoppable, and he didn't miss a step in his tale about two marooned mismatched salesmen trying to find their way home in time for turkey. Thirty years later, looking back on its iconic ""those aren't pillows!"" joke may be an exercise in regret—was that gay-panic stuff really funny?—but all the enduring good parts of ’80s comedies are still there, too. Martin's Type-A act. Candy's clueless, overbearing schmuck-schtick. An Edie McClurg moment! It's as ridiculous and sweet as anything you'd want to watch this time of year. (It still doesn't make up for Long Duk Dong, though.) —Peter RubinWhere to stream it: Amazon, iTunes

Prisoners (2013)

Set in a rural Pennsylvania town during Thanksgiving, Prisoners captures the chilly, drizzly, leaf-slick feel of fall—and uses it as the backdrop of a brutal revenge-thriller. Hugh Jackman plays Keller, a good-dude dad whose daughter is kidnapped; the crime transforms him into a morally malleable justice-seeker, and sends him on a collision course with Loki, a circumspect cop played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Their shared mission to find the kid leads to a series of harrowing discoveries about the community in which they live, as well as about the boundaries of their own humanity. Prisoners is modern noir at its most brutal, and while it will likely drive some family members from the room, at least that will give you some valuable holiday alone-time, right? —Brian RafteryWhere to stream it: Amazon, YouTube, iTunes

Rocky (1976)

This 1976 sleeper hit launched a decades-long franchise, yielded a chart-flying No. 1 hit, and turned Sylvester Stallone into an Oscar-nominated, box-office KO'ing superstar. But while later Rocky films were bogged down by get-in-the-ring revenge narratives, the original is a deeply affecting working-class romance that finds Rocky and Talia Shire's Adrian (sorry: Adriaaaaaaaan!) trying to overcome their social shortcomings. They're aided in part by her brother, Paulie (Burt Ward), who serves as accidental their go-between, resulting in a disastrous Thanksgiving dinner in which a turkey goes flying out the door (""You want the bird? Go in the alley and eat the bird!""). Watch it with Ryan Coogler's equally affecting 2015 hit Creed for the perfect one-two holiday punch. — Brian Raftery Where to stream it: Amazon, iTunes

Spider-Man (2002)

Sam Raimi's first entry in the web saga seems charmingly modest nowadays: Released at a time when superhero movies were still a chancy prospect, Spider-Man is so uncomplicated, and so semi-small-stakes (there's only one major villain!) that it plays less like a big-screen epic, and more like a high-school dram-com. But the movie's peppy spirit and sharply drawn characters pay off throughout, especially in one tense holiday scene in which bad guy Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) shows up for Thanksgiving dinner with his nemesis, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire, never more wide-eyed). The movie's 15-year-old computer effects may no longer be quite as awe-inspiring, but when it comes to unfussy, pre-franchise-era family fun, Spider-Man still swings. —Brian RafteryWhere to stream it: Amazon, YouTube, iTunes

The West Wing, ""Shibboleth"" (2000)

Rewatching The West Wing is like going home for the holidays—better, really, because it's actually soothing. And “Shibboleth” (Season 2, Episode 8) is the walk-and-talk political drama at its feel-good best. Sure, President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) has to decide whether to grant asylum to a boatload of Chinese evangelical Christians, but for most of the episode, he’s just being hilariously, dadishly picky about turkey-carving knives. And—as always—the show’s real delight is in the antics of Press Secretary CJ Cregg (Allison Janney), who has to decide whether the president should pardon a turkey named Eric or another named Troy. (A good West Wing binge, I might add, would also provide an opportunity to bask in the presence of a Sorkinian president who really, really knows his way around a sentence.) —Emma Grey Ellis Where to stream it: Amazon, YouTube, iTunes","wemadethisforthecostofabiggiesmallsvideo

The consulate official, identified by the AP as vice consul Stephanie Bohlen, was attacked while driving on a coastal road in Angra dos Reis, according to police. Bohlen was driving with a man identified as her partner. He was not hit.

Bohlen was initially transported to a local hospital but she was then transferred to a hospital in Rio for surgery, the AP reported.

A State Department spokesperson confirmed to ABC News that a consulate official was involved in an incident involving gunfire, but declined to provide further information.

A British tourist was shot and wounded in Angra dos Reis earlier this year, when she ended up in a rough neighborhood.","state department

People were seen fleeing the Oxford Circus Tube station, taking shelter in nearby buildings and holding each other as police descended on the area to respond to the reports.

Oxford Street erupted into chaos as panicked people ran for cover, according to Ian Pannell, ABC News’ senior foreign correspondent, who was on the scene.

APTN

People screamed and shouted, tripping and falling over each other in sheer terror. One woman was injured in the rush, police said, but it was minor.

The London Ambulance Service said it treated several patients who had sustained injuries while leaving the Oxford Circus area. Eight people were taken to two hospitals for minor injuries, according to the service.

Oxford Street is one the busiest shopping centers in London, comparable to New York City’s Times Square. The stores in the area immediately shuttered their doors and windows to protect people from the commotion.

Police are looking into what led people to flee the station.

For six months, Wilmington,...",2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,abc-news,Chemical company's response to water worries: Silence,http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/chemical-companys-response-water-worries-silence-51377365,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_ca750284b7694b5fa5203abd5c413972_16x9_992.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Americans have grown accustomed to hearing apologies from everyone from cheating car-makers to cheating presidents, but a Fortune 500 chemical company with a pollution problem in North Carolina is following a different model: don't apologize, don't explain.

For six months, Wilmington, Delaware-based Chemours Co. has faced questions about an unregulated chemical with unknown health risks that flowed from the company's plant into the Cape Fear River, which provides drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people.

The company has said virtually nothing in its own defense about chemicals it may have discharged for nearly four decades, and it skipped legislative hearings looking into health concerns.

Earlier this month, North Carolina environmental regulators said they might fine Chemours, revoke its license to discharge treated wastewater into the nearby river and open a criminal probe. State officials said the company chose silence over reporting a chemical spill last month as required.

In a rare response, Chemours said it's committed to operating the plant, which employs about 900, ""in accordance with all applicable laws and in a manner that respects the environment and public health and safety.""

New tests have detected the chemical GenX, used to make Teflon and other industrial products, at levels beyond the state's estimated but legally unenforceable safety guidepost in 50 private water wells near Chemours' Fayetteville plant and at a water treatment plant in Wilmington, about 100 miles (62 kilometers) downstream. There are no federal health standards addressing GenX and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies it as an ""emerging contaminant"" to be studied.

Lack of information about the chemical, its prevalence and health effects has disturbed people across eastern North Carolina.

John Fisher, 77, said when he moved into his home 20 years ago the company's predecessor, DuPont, would invite neighbors through the gates for picnics and plant tours. But the only contact he's had with Chemours was a notice a couple of weeks ago that his water well needed testing, and its outside vendor arranging to drop off bottled water.

""They haven't officially gotten a hold of us saying, hey, we feel sorry for you, this is what we're going to do for you,"" Fisher said.

Fisher said he wonders whether GenX or other chemicals in his well water caused the cancer deaths of his dog and his daughter's dogs next door.

""They would get big balls hanging off their bellies and they were all cancerous,"" Fisher said. ""We couldn't figure out why all our dogs were dying of cancer.""

DuPont began using GenX to replace another fluorinated compound after neighbors of the company's Parkersburg, West Virginia, plant claimed in more than 3,500 lawsuits that the compound made them sick. DuPont spun off Chemours into a separate company two years ago. A jury in July 2016 found the two companies liable for a man's testicular cancer that he said was linked to a chemical emitted by the West Virginia plant.

The two companies this year agreed to pay nearly $671 million to settle further lawsuits.

Chemours' zipped-lip strategy is likely a defensive crouch against the threat of costly lawsuits at a time when its financial future looks bright, said Geoffrey Basye, a public affairs consultant and former Federal Aviation Administration spokesman under President George W. Bush. Bond rating agency Moody's has upgraded its opinion of the company and Chemours' stock price has more than doubled since the start of the year.

""Not only can a stock's performance play a pivotal role in how a company chooses to respond, or not respond, major shareholders and the board can also influence a company's public affairs posture,"" Basye said.

The company's caution could make people think it's hiding something, he said, but he noted that industrial companies like Chemours tend to have a different culture from enterprises that deal directly with consumers.

""Companies who tend to operate in the shadows before a crisis occurs have a tendency to stay in the shadows once the crisis hits,"" Bayse said.

Chemours' silence runs contrary to legal lessons and social science research that suggest addressing mistakes eases hard feelings and saves corporations money, said Maurice Schweitzer, a Wharton business school professor who teaches negotiation and corporate decision-making.

Studies have found an apology for medical mistakes can be enough to satisfy aggrieved patients, leading to fewer malpractice actions, greater willingness to settle lawsuits and lower demand for damages, Schweitzer said.

""The natural tendency to keep a low profile, hope things blow over, is exactly what anyone who's been harmed by some action doesn't want,"" he said.

President Donald Trump plans to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday to try to hammer out the end-of-year agenda.

For Trump and the Republican-run Congress still reaching for their first major legislative victory, tax cuts would fit the bill. Democrats will carry leverage into year-end talks on agency budgets. Hanging over it all are congressional elections less than 12 months away.

A look at December's difficult agenda:

———

TAXES

The House has passed a 10-year, $1.4 trillion tax cut that blends a sharp reduction in top corporate and business tax rates with more modest relief for individuals. The Senate anticipates voting on its version this coming week. The Senate plan has larger rate cuts for individuals and a more generous per-child tax credit, but contains greater budgetary gamesmanship. Republicans can pass the measure without Democratic votes.

———

SPENDING

A temporary spending measure expires Dec. 8. Congress needs to pass an extension to avert a partial government shutdown. There also are 12 unfinished appropriations bills that must be completed. Accomplishing that would require an adjustment of spending caps that are the remnant of a failed 2011 budget deal. Democratic votes are required to pass the measures but bipartisan talks are behind schedule. Trump's recent $44 billion request for hurricane aid, his third, is drawing criticism from Texans and others who say it ignores desperate needs in hurricane-hit states and Puerto Rico.

———

IMMIGRATION

A major battle over paying for Trump's long-promised border wall with Mexico should finally come to a head. Also, Democrats and moderate Republicans are pressing for a legislative fix to protect the legal status of immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Republicans do not want that issue caught up in the funding bill, but Democrats have other ideas.

———

HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN

A popular program that provides health care to 9 million children of low-income families faces reauthorization after its funding expired at the end of September. States have been getting by on holdover money, but some states are reporting that they'll run out this month and would have to cut off care. Bipartisan talks over how to pay for an extension will require a breakthrough soon.

———

ODDS & ENDS

The financially troubled flood insurance program expires Dec. 8. A bill to renew it has passed the House, but the Senate measure is stalled. A program permitting warrantless electronic surveillance of foreigners by U.S. intelligence agencies faces renewal. More revelations regarding sexual harassment on Capitol Hill are possible, and ethics investigations involving Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and, perhaps, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., could get underway. The House plans to vote this coming week on requiring anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for all members and their staffs. Alabama voters on Dec. 12 will elect Republican Roy Moore or Democrat Doug Jones in a closely watched Senate race.","republicanrun congress

Justice Neil Gorsuch didn't disappoint them, just as he hasn't in his first seven months on the Supreme Court.

""Tonight I can report that a person can be both a publicly committed originalist and textualist and be confirmed to the Supreme Court,"" Gorsuch said to sustained applause from members of the Federalist Society, using terms by which conservatives often seek to distinguish themselves from more liberal judges.

The 50-year-old justice has been almost exactly what conservatives hoped for and liberals dreaded when he joined the court in April. He has consistently, even aggressively, lined up with the court's most conservative justices. He has even split with Chief Justice John Roberts, viewed by some as insufficiently conservative because of his two opinions upholding President Barack Obama's health law.

During arguments, Gorsuch has asked repeatedly about the original understanding of parts of the Constitution and laws, and he has raised questions about some long-standing court precedents, including the civil rights landmark ruling on ""one person, one vote.

Liberals' despair about Gorsuch goes beyond his judicial actions. He occupies a seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia which they thought Obama would get to fill. But Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama's nominee, a strategy that paid off when Donald Trump unexpectedly won the White House.

At the Federalist Society, Gorsuch recognized the improbable turn of events that led him from an appellate judgeship in his native Colorado to America's highest court.

If someone had told Gorsuch a year ago what would soon transpire, ""I would have said that you had taken way too much advantage of my home state's generous drug laws,"" he said.

Gorsuch likes to remind audiences of his relative youth, despite his head of silver hair, suggesting a long tenure on the bench. In front of a nonpartisan audience last month, he talked about his teenage daughters and the regular, early morning 17-mile bike rides along the C&O canal that he does with a friend.

He spoke fondly of the horses, goats, chickens and rabbits on the small farm where his family lived outside Boulder, Colorado, before moving to the Washington area this year. He enthusiastically recounted ski outings and his favorite moguls.

Early reviews of Gorsuch's time on the court have varied with the ideological bent of his reviewers.

While his confirmation was pending, the liberal Alliance for Justice worried that Gorsuch would often embrace the most conservative outcome on the high court.

""Our concerns were confirmed,"" said Nan Aron, the group's president.

Daniel Epps, a Washington University law professor in St. Louis and onetime law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy, said he finds Gorsuch's style sometimes grating, less so the substance of his questions at arguments.

During a high-profile argument about politics in redistricting in October, Gorsuch began a question by suggesting that ""maybe we can just for a second talk about the arcane matter, the Constitution.""

To Epps, the tone was all wrong, especially for the new guy on the nine-member court. ""I'd love to see a bit more recognition that the court deals with really hard questions that many people, including his colleagues, have struggled with for a long time. If someone thinks he has all the answers, maybe he's missing something important,"" Epps said.

Some of Gorsuch's choices of where to speak — with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., at the Trump International Hotel and at the Federalist Society dinner — also have fed perceptions that rubbed his critics the wrong way.

The dinner, Aron said, ""was just the latest stop on Neil Gorsuch's thank you tour to honor the people who got him what should have been Merrick Garland's job."" Garland, an appeals court judge, the Obama nominee whom the Senate blocked.

""I think he could have done a better job certainly in the public appearances he chooses to make to sort of send the signal that he's not a Republican justice, he's a justice,"" said Epps, who also co-hosts the Supreme Court-focused First Mondays podcast.

His co-host, Ian Samuel, said there has been ""a hysterical overreaction"" to Gorsuch's questions in the courtroom. Samuel, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Scalia law clerk, said Gorsuch has an obvious interest in questions about accountability in the American system of government and control over the court system. ""It's better that he puts it out there and says this is who I am. I don't think he cares whether some people think it's shocking,"" Samuel said.

Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president who has advised Trump on judicial picks, also took issue with Gorsuch's critics when he introduced the justice at the dinner. ""They mischaracterize candor and a demand for rigorous analysis as polarizing,"" Leo said.

Gorsuch and Leo embraced on the podium, in front of an adoring crowd of like-minded lawyers, judges and academics. The Federalist Society, which counted Scalia among its earliest backers, has helped Trump identify candidates for federal judgeships and has members in legal jobs across his administration.

Gorsuch made no apologies either for the substance of his questions and writing, or his style. He talked at length about the importance of seeking out the meaning of the Constitution and laws as they were understood when they written.

""Originalism has regained its place at the table of constitutional interpretation, and textualism in the reading of statutes has triumphed. And neither one is going anywhere on my watch,"" Gorsuch said.

He went on to note that ""some pundits have expressed bewilderment"" about the questions he asks in court.

""But while I have you here tonight, I thought I might just settle the matter once and for all by taking a poll. ... Should I just keep on asking about the text and original meaning of the Constitution?"" he asked.

The response was predictably and overwhelmingly in favor.

Thousands of riot police and paramilitary personnel on Saturday fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon at the protesters in an attempt to dislodge them from a major highway into Islamabad.

The protesters, numbering as many as 2,000, stood their ground, fighting back by throwing stones and beating police with sticks and metal rods in running battles that continued throughout the day.

The protesters have been blocking the Islamabad expressway, the main road into the capital, since November 8, demanding the resignation of Federal Law Minister Zahid Hamid over a perceived softening of the state's position on blasphemy.

Last week, a Pakistani court ordered the government to clear the sit-in protest, prompting a series of meetings between protest leaders and the government to attempt to reconcile differences.

By midday, the demonstrators appeared to have beaten back the police to roadblocks located several kilometres away from the site of the protest.

""We will remain deployed but are holding our positions for now,"" Khalid Khattak, Islamabad'd police chief, told Al Jazeera. ""We do not want to cause further casualties [and] will adopt a new strategy soon.""

At least 111 of those injured in the clashes were members of the police or other security forces, said Dr Farrukh Kamal, an official at the PIMS government hospital where most of the wounded were being treated.

Official figures on how many protesters had been arrested during the crackdown were not immediately available.

Caught in the crossfire

Liaquat Kazmi, 30, was standing outside his home near the Faizabad interchange, where the protest is centred, when he was manhandled and beaten by police as the crackdown got under way.

""I am just a regular citizen, I have no connection to the protesters or to the police,"" he said from his hospital bed. ""Without asking any questions as to who I was, [the police] brutally beat me, and then one of them shot me at close range with a rubber bullet.""

Kazmi suffered a serious wound to the chest, but doctors said he would make a full recovery.

Safoor Akram, 23, a police constable from the nearby town of Rawat, was among those tasked with being the first wave in the clearing operation against the protesters.

""We were surrounded by those maulvis [religious leaders]. First, they stole our mobiles and wallets, and then they beat us mercilessly with sticks and their fists,"" he told Al Jazeera.

Akram and two other policemen were then taken hostage and held by the protesters for five hours, he said. They were eventually released.

As the crackdown got under way, Pakistan’s media regulator ordered all television news channels other than the state broadcaster taken off air, saying their live coverage was compromising the security operation.

Shortly thereafter, access to social media sites Twitter and Facebook was also cut across the country.

Protesters digging in

By nightfall, small protests had spread to other cities, with gatherings and limited clashes reported from Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, as well as in Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad.

In Islamabad, the protesters appeared to have dug in for the night, with more than 1,000 gathered around a makeshift stage, raising slogans of solidarity with Islam's Prophet and vowing not to back down.

The smell of tear gas hung heavy in the air, hours after the last shell had been fired from the day’s onslaught.

The road that has become the protesters home over the last two weeks was strewn with stones and other detritus from the earlier battle. Among the crowd, many protesters stood armed with sticks and rods, policing the entry points of the demonstration.

Nearby, many others were huddled around small fires in makeshift tents, as night drew in.

Al Jazeera,"Army statement says air force destroyed a number of vehicles used in Friday's deadly attack, killing all those aboard.",2017-11-25T08:10:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Egyptian air strike kills 'terrorist' mosque attackers,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/egyptian-air-strike-kills-terrorist-mosque-attackers-171125074521875.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/25/166e31a318994dc8ba755a1187eedfac_18.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The Egyptian army says an air raid killed some of the attackers involved in Friday's massacre when at least 305 people died in a bomb-and-gun attack on a mosque.

In a statement late on Friday, army spokesman Tamer Rifai said the Egyptian air force chased down the assailants who, according to officials, arrived in four 4WD vehicles and carried out the attack during noon prayers.

""The air forces chased the terrorists and discovered and destroyed a number of vehicles that were involved in carrying out the brutal terrorist attack ... Those on board were also killed,"" Rifai said.

The massacre occurred in Bir al-Abed, a town in North Sinai province.

The mosque - about 40km west of el-Arish, the provincial capital of North Sinai - was frequented by followers of Sufism, a more mystical form of Islam.

No group has claimed responsibility, but according to a statement on Saturday from Egypt's public prosecutor, the attackers were carrying a flag representing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL, also known as ISIS). The government declared a three-day period of mourning for the victims.

Egyptian state media MENA said 120 people were also wounded in the attack.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi condemned the assault, which he described as ""criminal"" and ""cowardly"" in a televised statement on Friday.

He said the attack ""will not go unpunished"".

""The armed forces and the police will avenge our martyrs and restore security and stability with the utmost force,"" Sisi said.

Egypt has for years battled an armed, anti-government campaign on the rugged and thinly populated Sinai Peninsula. The campaign has gained pace since the military overthrew democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013.

In 2014, following a suicide bombing that killed 33 soldiers, Sisi declared a state of emergency on the peninsula, describing it as a ""nesting ground for terrorism and terrorists"".

{articleGUID}

Previous attacks in Sinai mostly aimed at security forces and members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority.

However, mosques in North Sinai's Sheikh Zuweid town have also been hit.

The Bir al-Abed mosque was an easy target because it was outside the province's main cities.

The mosque may also have been targeted because it was attended by members of the Sufi sect, who are considered infidels by armed groups such as ISIL.

In 2016, ISIL fighters released images purportedly showing the execution of a 100-year-old Sufi religious leader, whom they accused of ""witchcraft"".

Timothy Kaldas, a professor at Nile University in Cairo, told Al Jazeera that Friday's assault ""fits the pattern of ISIS attacks"".

""Potentially, it's another attack against Sufis in northern Sinai. Potentially, it's retaliation for tribes co-operating with the state in the crackdown on ISIS,"" he said.

Kaldas said ISIL has been ""more willing to target civilians, as we saw with a lot of attacks on the Egyptian-Christian community in the past year"".","egypts coptic christian

Al Jazeera,Dhahi Khalfan calls for the bombing of Qatar-based media network after Friday's attack on a mosque in Egypt's Sinai.,2017-11-25T16:09:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Dubai security chief calls for bombing of Al Jazeera,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/dubai-security-chief-calls-bombing-al-jazeera-171125143439231.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/8/7/86daa8ef78864892a540a88ccd3d9f46_18.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"A senior security official in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has sparked outrage after calling for the bombing of Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based media network.

In a series of posts on Twitter on Friday, Dubai Lieutenant General Dhahi Khalfan launched a scathing attack against Al Jazeera, accusing it of provoking a bomb and gun assault on a mosque in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula earlier in the day.

على التحالف أن يقصف الآلة الداعية للارهاب..قناة داعش والقاعدة والنصرة جزيرة الارهاب — ضاحي خلفان تميم (@Dhahi_Khalfan) November 24, 2017

""The alliance must bomb the machine of terrorism ... the channel of ISIL, al-Qaeda and the al-Nusra front, Al Jazeera the terrorists,"" the former police chief and now head of security in the Emirate told his 2.42 million followers on the social media site.

""For how long will they [Al Jazeera] continue to tamper with the security of Egypt and the Arab world?"" he tweeted.

Khalfan then posted an image of Al Jazeera's iconic logo superimposed in front of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group, former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and 91-year-old Islamic theologian Yusuf al-Qaradawi.

What Dhahi Khalfan is doing is incitement to terrorism. Terrorism is not just limited to committing a crime, but any act or statement that paves the way for a terrorist act or incites it, and incitement to terrorism is terrorism itself. Yaser Abuhilalah, managing director of Al Jazeera Arabic

Yaser Abuhilalah, managing director of Al Jazeera Arabic, said Khalfan bore ""full responsibility for any attack against Al Jazeera and its employees"".

""The UAE needs to respond [to Khalfan's comments]. He's not just an Emirati citizen but an official in the UAE government,"" Abuhilalah told al-Quds al-Arabi on Saturday.

""He is using a moment of anger and grief over the terrible attack in Sinai to fuel his hatred against Al Jazeera.

""What Dhahi Khalfan is doing is incitement to terrorism. Terrorism is not just limited to committing a crime, but any act or statement that paves the way for a terrorist act or incites it, and incitement to terrorism is terrorism itself,"" he said.

Stoking controversy

Khalfan has made several controversial comments in the past but has never been prosecuted under the UAE's anti-hate speech laws.

In March of last year, he made headlines after urging Arabs to ally with Israel against ""enemies of the Middle East"" - a veiled attack against Iran and the region's Shia Muslims.

And earlier this year, the 66-year-old tweeted his ""complete support"" for US President Donald Trump's Muslim ban.

{articleGUID}

Khalfan railed against Iraqis, Somalis and Iranians, nationalities included in the US travel restrictions, calling them ""unproductive groups"", mocked the war and poverty afflicting Iraq, and would also call on the UAE to annex Qatar, referring to it as an ""eighth emirate.""

The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting ""terrorism"", an allegation Doha has vehemently denied.

As part of the blockade, the UAE made expressing sympathy towards Qatar a punishable offence, with a jail term of up to 15 years and a fine of at least AED 500,000 ($136,000).

On June 22, the Saudi-led group issued a 13-point list of demands, including the shutdown of Al Jazeera, the limiting of ties with Iran and the expulsion of Turkish troops stationed in the country, as a prerequisite to lifting the sanctions.

Qatar rejected the demands as an infringement on its sovereignty.

Since its launch 21 years ago, Al Jazeera's offices have occasionally been bombed or shut down in many places, including Kabul, Baghdad and Gaza.","donald trumps muslim ban articleguid khalfan

Farah Najjar,"Confrontation 'looming' between SDF and FSA, with the pair at odds over the reasons for a major military defection.",2017-11-24T11:54:00Z,al-jazeera-english,What is the future of the Syrian Democratic Forces?,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/future-syrian-democratic-forces-171124110417741.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/24/e0cc3acfac6a428490d174c44facda38_18.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Two Syrian groups are at odds over the sudden departure of a high-ranking Syrian commander who reportedly left for neighbouring Turkey last week.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA), a loose entity of opposition rebel groups, have presented different versions of the reasons behind General Talal Silo's departure.

Silo served as the SDF's spokesperson, and his parting marks the first major defection among the forces' top ranks. While the SDF refuses to acknowledge the departure as an official resignation, the FSA says his defection has been ""in the works for a very long time"". Silo, who belongs to the Turkmen ethnicity, previously served as a high-ranking general within the FSA when the group was first created.

""We had several options in front of us, so the best and most feasible one was for Silo to break away from the SDF towards [Turkey],"" Abou al-Farouk, an FSA spokesperson and lieutenant in the north, told Al Jazeera.

The FSA aided Turkish authorities in facilitating Silo's departure via northern Syria, from where he was ushered to Turkey, according to Abou al-Farouk.

There has been no official comment from Turkey, which perceives the SDF, led by the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), as a security threat for its alleged links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) separatists inside Turkey. The PKK has waged an armed campaign since 1984 that has killed more than 40,000 people.

""In a nutshell, the SDF, who call themselves democratic, have been claiming that they are the representatives of the people - of all the minorities and races - from Arabs to Kurds to Turkmen,"" Abou al-Farouk said.

""So when we work on pulling out people like our brother Silo from the SDF, we would have succeeded in making them lose the diversity tactic that they promote,"" he added. ""In this case, they used Silo's Turkmen origin to promote that they are representatives of a minority and not just Kurds.""

Initially founded by a group of officers who defected from the Syrian Armed Forces in 2011, the FSA is a conglomeration of armed groups fighting under a larger umbrella, without a unified, central command. Several FSA groups have since shifted alliances, but in 2016, they were mobilised with Turkey's support to limit the SDF's influence along Turkey's southern border.

Founded in 2015, the SDF says it is fighting to establish a democratic and federal Syria along the lines of the Rojava region in the north. Its makeup largely consists of Kurdish YPG fighters and smaller groups of Arab, Turkmen and Armenian fighters.

Earlier this year, the US began arming them before an offensive to recapture Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS). The Kurdish YPG and its allies have carved out autonomous regions in the north, and they now control nearly a quarter of Syria.

The FSA and SDF are adversaries, and are currently controlling various parts of Syria, which is in its seventh year of war.

""We're still working on pulling out Arab leaders within the SDF,"" said Abou al-Farouk, noting this has been in the works on a ""high intelligence level"".

Silo's defection comes after months of mounting discontent by Arabs within the SDF, who say they have been sidelined when it comes to decision-making.

They also blame the YPG for discriminating against them, but the YPG has denied these allegations.

Complex proxy war

Silo's departure reflects the complexities of Syria's proxy war. While the two groups were created to fight varying enemies - the FSA against Syrian government forces and the SDF against ISIL - each claims to represent the ""oppressed"".

Aron Lund, a Syria expert and Century Foundation fellow, said that the SDF will remain relevant as long as it controls territory and has powerful armed forces.

""The fact that they have the US Air Force at their back makes it impossible for Assad's government to simply ignore them or try to seize their areas with force,"" said Lund. ""How Assad and his allies decide to handle the SDF problem will probably be determined by what the United States decides to do.""

He further noted that since American policy under US President Donald Trump remains unclear, the SDF would have a much ""weaker hand"" or ""risk military defeat"" if the US signals that it wants to leave Syria.

""But American decisions will likely be informed by several factors, including the risk of a jihadi resurgence, Turkish pressure to abandon the SDF, and concerns in Washington over Iran's influence in an Assad-run Syria,"" Lund explained.

US alliance

The US has come under international scrutiny for arming the Kurdish-led SDF, especially since they have undertaken operations in Arab-majority cities. The fear in shifting these regions' demography has been a point of contestation, augmented by Silo's departure and the fact that his position, for the time being, has been filled by a Kurd.

A spokesperson told Al Jazeera that the coalition fighting ISIL in the region does not have any role in determining the internal staffing of the SDF, but indicated that the US would remain in Syria supporting ""its partners"" for the foreseeable future as ""a lot of fighting remains to defeat remaining pockets of ISIL"".

Mostafa Bali, the SDF's media relations head, reiterated the importance of the SDF in fighting ""other terrorist groups"".

""We [SDF] were not just created for the goal of fighting ISIL. We will not simply disappear afterwards,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""There are still many terrorist factions that remain in Syria, and these are strong. They include Hayet Tahrir al-Sham [former al-Qaeda affiliates] and al-Nusra Front.""

The SDF considers itself the ""better, more refined model"" of Syria's future army. According to Bali, the forces will ""naturally"" remain centred in the Kurdish north.

But Samer Abboud, an associate professor of international studies at Arcadia University, noted that there will be a sustained campaign by the Astana powers - Russia, Turkey and Iran - to downplay the SDF's capacity, despite it being ""one of the strongest"" armed groups on the ground.

""The confrontation with the SDF was put on hold until this later stage because the Kurdish issue is the major one facing the regime and its allies now,"" he said, referencing Silo's defection as the first stage of a ""looming"" confrontation.

Abboud questioned whether the US would abandon its SDF partners to maintain its relationship with Russia.

""We can't have it both ways - it's a threat when it's around and a threat when it's not around,"" he said of the SDF. ""So I think that eventually the US-SDF link could be severed, sacrificed at the altar of US-Russian agreement on Syria.""

However, the FSA's trust in Turkey has given the group hope.

""In light of the international aggression that happened, we have to coordinate with our biggest ally and supporter moving forward, Turkey, to rebuild ourselves better and stronger to prepare for future battles,"" said Abou al-Farouk.","kurdistan workers party pkk

Leonid Ragozin,"Almost four months before the presidential elections, the Russian president still hasn't announced if he will run.",2017-11-25T12:16:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Is Vladimir Putin tired?,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/vladimir-putin-tired-171125121152173.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/11/25/7cc92f7a7ece4d628358838da3dca7a9_18.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"There is suddenly too much entropy in the Russian political universe. At least some people are acting as if there are no adults in the house. Political campaigns seem to start without the Kremlin's blessing, state TV channels contradict each other in their coverage of important stories, and infighting between Kremlin factions gets into the open. A major player in that infighting has been Igor Sechin, the head of the oil giant Rosneft, who helped engineer the arrest of Economy Minister Alexey Ulyukayev, but who is currently ignoring court summons for the same the case.

All of this prompts one question: Where is Vladimir Putin?

The March 2018 elections

Of course, the Russian leader is very much still around, his busy schedule reflected in daily news broadcasts on state TV. But as political expert Gleb Pavlovsky writes: ""the president is disappearing"". Currently a critic of Putin's political regime, Pavlovsky was one of its chief architects in the 2000s - definitely a man whose opinion matters on such occasions. In the article, he goes on to describe the Russian leader as a ""not-so-young gentleman dogged by power fatigue and accumulated weaknesses"".

Putin does often look drained during public appearances. Kremlin sources, quoted by Independent, went as far as claiming that he was on the verge of quitting in 2016 and only changed his mind after the surprise election of Donald Trump in the US.

It is conventional wisdom that Putin will seek re-election for what would be his fourth presidential term. But is a lame duck presidency what he really wants?

Russia's next presidential election is due in March 2018, but with only four months to go, the Kremlin is not giving away enough clues about how it is going to run the campaign and, in fact, still hasn't confirmed that Putin will be running. It is conventional wisdom that Putin will seek re-election for what would be his fourth presidential term. But is a lame duck presidency what he really wants?

There is also the issue of perceived legitimacy, which didn't come up for years as Putin had no strong rivals. But now he is being challenged by Alexey Navalny, who has revolutionised Russian politics by running an efficient presidential campaign and mobilising opposition supporters not just in Moscow and St Petersburg, but all over the country. No other opposition politician was ever able to achieve this during Putin's era.

Again, conventional wisdom goes that the authorities will bar Navalny from the election. But as time passes without the Kremlin making any coherent statements on whether Putin will run, Navalny is gaining strength. The stronger he gets, the weaker Putin's claim to legitimacy will be in the event that he chooses to run in an uncompetitive election.

If the Kremlin allows Navalny to register as a candidate, Putin is still very likely to win, but for him, that means stepping into unchartered territory. Will this let a revolutionary genie out of the bottle, as it happened with Mikhail Gorbachev's limited reforms leading to the colossal release of political energy which destroyed the entire communist system? Will it be interpreted as a sign of weakness by the hardline part of the establishment? And is this allegedly tired man up for the challenge of running a real campaign against a real rival? Can he run in an election that does not use the surrogate opposition leaders who helped the Kremlin maintain a semblance of pluralism in the last three elections?

A paramount issue is the agenda of the next presidency. Russian political cycles can be compared to TV series, where each season is tied by a single coherent plot. The first season was all about political stability and economic growth, spurred by high oil prices. That theme exhausted itself by 2012 when the economy slowed down and the middle class showed open discontent with corruption and undemocratic nature of the regime.

The second season began with the chaotic revolution in Ukraine, which allowed the political leadership, or - as many Russians say - the ""collective Putin"", to rebrand the regime by embracing irredentist nationalism and aggressive conservatism, a plagiarised version of the Christian fundamentalism of the US Bible Belt. That transformation culminated in the annexation of Crimea, which sent Putin's approval ratings soaring to almost 90 percent.

But this plot is about to exhaust itself, too. Whatever new unifying agenda Russia's ruling elite might come up with, it will define both the direction the country will take in the next six years and who will be the face of this new political brand. Putin is a not a brand per se - it is the agenda he embodies, which matters.

The third season with a new plot

The Kremlin already has a plot in mind for the third season that will help keep the pro-Kremlin majority intact and the Navalny-led opposition at bay. It already has something up its sleeve. It is the mind-bogglingly massive reconstruction and modernisation of urban infrastructure in Moscow - an accomplishment the government is preparing to replicate during the next presidential term in dozens of other large Russian cities.

Such a new positivist agenda would contrast sharply with the confrontational negativism that defines Putin's current presidential term. The modernisation of Russian cities, which retain much of the outdated Soviet-era infrastructure is long overdue. It will not only improve the quality of living for Russians, but also serve as a contrast to the impoverished and war-torn Ukraine, which the Kremlin desperately wants to prevent from becoming an alternative Russia - a place where millions of Russian-speakers will live better and freer than in Russia proper. Besides, such a large-scale public-sector project may boost the sluggish economy.

The current face of this agenda is Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin, who used to serve as Putin's chief of staff between 2005 and 2008. A shrewd apparatchik experienced in dealing with both politics and the economy, Sobyanin is also relatively old (59 years old) and uncharismatic, the latter two qualities, in fact, giving him an advantage in the anti-meritocratic system that the Russian establishment is. Crucially, he defeated Navalny in the 2012 local elections in Moscow, when the opposition leader was surprisingly released from prison and allowed to run for mayor's office (Navally gained 27 percent of the vote campaigning on a shoestring with almost no access to state TV airtime).

If Putin finally confirms that he is running for the fourth term, Sobyanin could become a near-ideal replacement for Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev providing a sense (or at least an illusion) of change to the growing number of Russians who seek it.

If - perhaps not now, but sometime in the middle of his term - Putin decides to call it a day, the current Moscow mayor will be uniquely positioned to offer a popular forward-looking agenda that preserves the pro-regime majority and provides a smooth transition into a post-Putin era.

Cross the two-lane avenue outside and one will have entered Brazil.

Not far away, one will find casinos, motels and brothels typical of a crime-ridden frontier.

The town is on a key trafficking route into Brazil, with two major gangs - the First Command of the Capital (PCC) from Sao Paulo and the Red Command (CV) from Rio de Janeiro - competing to import Bolivian cocaine, firearms and other contraband.

In June 2016, a ceasefire between the factions came to an end when lead gangster Jorge Rafaat, allied with the CV and known as the ""king of the frontier"" was executed in his armoured Hummer. His death has been attributed to the PCC.

Pedro Juan Caballero is just the start of a journey into a more tranquil, hidden - but no less illegal - world just a few kilometres from the border with Brazil.

It is here - for the most part, untroubled by police or other authorities - that gigantic plantations exist to grow the vast majority of the cannabis smoked by millions of Brazilians.

The plantations

Eighty percent of cannabis produced in Paraguay is smuggled to Brazil, according to data from Paraguay's National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD).

{articleGUID}

Three million Brazilians regularly use the drug, according to the Second National Survey on Alcohol and Drugs at the Federal University of Sao Paulo, and in the first six months of 2017, Brazil's Federal Police seized 126 tonnes of the drug, most of it originating from Paraguay.

Unlike Colombia and Uruguay, planting cannabis is illegal in both Brazil and Paraguay.

The Paraguayan plantations are believed to cover 7,000 hectares. Those working on land reveal a widespread system of impunity, guaranteed by a network of corrupt police officers and other officials.

Among these plantation workers is Adriano*, a 25-year-old Brazilian who manages a plantation for its ""owner"". Adriano spends most of the year in the fields with the workers who plant and pick cannabis, mediating any problems between them and the field boss.

Adriano's boss, Gerson*, is a 50-year-old Brazilian who was born into a family that has always exploited cannabis.

While he is the ""owner"" of two plantations, he is not the legitimate owner of the farms, which are usually appropriated public land - including forests and protected national parks - or rented from the owner of a much larger estate.

In a Toyota pick-up truck, loaded with food and cleaning products, Gerson drove to his plantation, talking to Adriano about the threats they face from police units.

The Paraguayan police do not cause many problems, Gerson said.

When stopped, the pair paid a bribe of about $70 and were allowed to continue.

The Brazilian police are similar, Gerson added, except one feared military police unit.

""They do not mess around,"" he said. ""With them, it is either jail or a coffin.""

Like the town they had just left behind, the Brazilian and Paraguayan roads run side by side. The only difference between the two is that if the Brazilian asphalt is bad, the Paraguayan is often nonexistent.

Along the way, the pick-up changed side, and country, several times, in an effort to avoid police stations.

While passing through the nearest town to the plantation, which has less than 1,000 inhabitants, Gerson rolled up the tinted windows to avoid being seen.

{articleGUID}

The headquarters on the farm is a simple house with a bedroom full of bunk beds, a bathroom with hot water and a television and satellite dish.

Adriano explains that in his five years at various plantations in the region, it is the first time that he has such comfort; usually, he would spend months camped out on the plantations.

Adriano and Gerson are armed with pistols.

But unlike the frontier, in the countryside disputes between groups are almost unheard of and police operations are usually announced beforehand and the outcome negotiated.

The 'operations'

No one wants to draw too much attention to what is going on.

According to Gerson, politicians are bribed to delay the pavement of roads that would improve access to the region, helping to complicate any police operation.

{articleGUID}

On one occasion, Gerson's informants called to tell him that SENAD were planning to carry out an operation in an area that included a plantation of his and four others.

Immediately, Gerson's team went to the farm and hid many tonnes of dried cannabis.

A day later, Gerson received a visit from Cabanas*, a Paraguayan man in his 70s, with a cowboy hat and a pistol in his holster.

He is the ""boss"" of the region and acts as an intermediary between the landowners and the Paraguayan government.

Cabanas said that police were proposing cancelling the operation if each plantation boss paid 10 million guarani ($1,800). It was unclear how many bosses there were, but Gerson said there hundreds of plantations in the region.

He explained that it is always the same at harvest time: the police threaten to invade the farms as a means of upping their bribes.

Last year, Brazilian Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes arrived in the region with SENAD officials, local media reported at the time. He used a machete to cut down cannabis plants, sending a signal to traffickers that illegal plantations would not be tolerated.

""It's all negotiated,"" Gerson said when asked about the operation.

""We deliver a little crop for them, take everything that's worth something out of there and leave the plants alone,"" he said.

'No one is ever arrested'

When asked about these claims, Francisco Ayala, the SENAD communication director, said that it ""must be assumed that there is no institution that is 100 percent transparent or 100 percent incorruptible, especially when it comes to drug trafficking, a business that moves many millions, which often makes it possible to buy what you wish, or the temptation to fall in the drug trafficking network"".

Ayala told Al Jazeera that ""any security force is in constant danger of its members falling into corruption"", but that SENAD has implemented policies to try to prevent this.

""We believe that this historic level of seizures that has taken place in the last three years, we have never before seen these levels of destruction of marijuana crops or seizures of cocaine, is precisely the result of this policy of purification and internal transparency,"" Ayala said.

""We are not infallible, there might always be corruption, but this policy is getting results and as the drug trade has been damaged in recent years in various regions of the country.""

The fields

During the four months the cannabis grows, a field is taken care of by two or three workers. At harvest time, another 10 are recruited to pick, dry, sack, shred and press the flowers.

Most workers receive 70,000 guarani ($12) a day.

The rates, as well as the price of the cannabis, are decided by the farm owners to avoid competition.

The camps where the peasants sleep are made of logs, canvas, string and wire.

The water comes from wells or streams and is often hot and brown.

The camp is very dirty and is scattered with cheap bottles of wine and Fortin, a local cachaca spirit.

The men work from sunrise to sunset, except for the cannabis press, which runs non-stop with lighting from a petrol generator.

There are also some fields that operate 24 hours a day during the harvest, with reflectors illuminating the fields.

Few have ever worked in any other type of agriculture. Most of the workers are young, around 20, silent and suspicious.

Their ambition is only evident in the looks in their eyes.

Roque* is responsible for a field, from sowing to harvesting. He puts his hand into the ground, chooses the seeds, fertilizers and techniques that will be used to grow the crops.

The now-25-year-old started planting cannabis at the age 17 after finishing high school and not being able to find a job. After four years harvesting crops for others, he now co-ordinates his own field, financed by Gerson.

Roque, who now takes half the profit from selling the cannabis, wants to get out of the plantation-life and start an agricultural supply shop.

He cares for his plants with affection and gives the patches nicknames.

He spends any profit he makes on girlfriends and prostitutes.

There are practically no women on the plantations, but workers communicate with girlfriends via WhatsApp.

There are still a few family farms, but these days, they are rare.

""It's getting harder and harder to work without a boss,"" Roque explained. ""Because the police are asking for more and more money.""

The older workers carry the calm acceptance of a life spent in monotony.

Cannabis money feeds families and keeps communities functioning in this corner of Paraguay, but does not provide enough to get these people out of their misery.

Even the managers live a paranoid existence with very few possessions - a motorcycle and some brand-name clothing, perhaps - and the certainty that they are easily replaceable.

If the money made from the trafficking of cannabis offsets the risk for anyone involved, it is not for these workers at the sharp end of the deal.

Joseph Stepansky,News of a preliminary repatriation agreement has sparked concerns among Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.,2017-11-25T09:03:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Rohingya refugees: 'I do not hope to return',http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/rohingya-refugees-hope-return-171125082135256.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/9/29/60af76f41b2b47069793ab3e3d42930f_18.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Kutupalong Refugee Camp, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - Rohingya refugees tuned in on handheld, nine-band radios to the news that the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar had signed a preliminary deal for their return.

The news slowly made its way throughout the labyrinthine alleyways of tarpaulin and bamboo shelters that more than 800,000 stateless Rohingya now call home. For those living in the camps, the development was frustratingly light on details, but the first repatriations could start in two months.

More than 620,000 Rohingya, a minority Muslim group, have fled Myanmar's Rakhine State since August 25 amid allegations of murder, mass rape, and coordinated arson carried out by the Myanmar military, in what the United States and United Nations have called ""ethnic cleansing"". The violence came after attacks on Myanmar police stations by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.

A 1982 law prohibits Rohingya from becoming citizens of Myanmar. For decades, smaller groups of Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh to escape persecution from the majority Buddhist population in Myanmar. The most recent repatriation agreement was in 1992.

Rights groups have called for international monitors to oversee the latest repatriation, noting that Rohingya must be promised safety, the right to return to their land, equal rights and citizenship. Amnesty International has called the deal premature, as thousands of Rohingya continue to flee to Bangladesh every week.

Al Jazeera spoke with Rohingya refugees at the Kutupalong Refugee Camp about the prospects of returning to Myanmar.

Abdul Jabar, 65, former community chairman from Tung Bazar Village

The military started firing at us as we were fleeing our village when they started the attacks [in August]. My son was killed and two of my daughters were taken away by the military. I have five other children who made it to Bangladesh … I am educated. When I was younger, it was better for us. I was educated by a Muslim government teacher.

But education is not so easy for Rohingya any more. I did not get a job, despite being educated, because I was Rohingya. Rather, other non-Rohingya got the job, even though I was better educated.

I heard the news about the repatriation agreement from the radio. We don't want the 1992 agreement. We want that no violence will happen to us, that people will get an education, that people will freely move and not have to bribe the military to get around. If we do not get more rights, I will die here in Bangladesh.

Nur Kamal, 18, farmer from Maungdaw Township

I came to the camps in the beginning of October. Our mosques and madrasas were closed by the government in 2012. The government has been pressuring us, and the situation got gradually more difficult. Our clerics were jailed.

If a Rohingya is well educated, he cannot get any job like Rakhine people. We cannot live freely. I'm extremely eager to go back to my homeland, but the first and main thing we need is citizenship. If we are not given citizenship, I would die rather than go back.

After the repatriation in 1992, Rohingya continued to be repressed. They would say, ""Why are you here? You are Bengali."" We're afraid this repatriation agreement will be the same as in 1992. We want a different agreement. In the 1992 agreement, you needed to show Myanmar identity papers to return. Most people don't have Myanmar identification cards. I have one and my grandfather has one, but my father does not. Families will be separated.

I will also only go back if we can return to our land. We really miss our land in Myanmar; it is too crowded here in the camps. We are in hardship here. We don't have fuel to cook food. First, we want citizenship status; that is our main demand. We want all people to be treated equally.

Nur Bahar, 35, mother of five from Buthidaung Township

I will never go back to Myanmar as things are now. The Myanmar government disregarded our dignity. Women were raped and oppressed by them. The military surrounded our village and began firing on us. We ran. My aunt's child and husband were killed.

We tried to hide in the woods. I was raped by the military. I was beaten, hit in the head and shoulders and legs. I never experienced peace in Myanmar. There, we could not sleep. Here, at least we can sleep and know we are safe.

Even if the Myanmar government says we are safe, I won't go. They say one thing and do another. I will only go if we are given citizenship status and the government promises us protection. They need to settle this in a just way. Otherwise, I will not go back to Myanmar, even if they have to kill me here in Bangladesh.

Sole Mohammed, 50, former shopkeeper in Maungdaw Township

I came to Bangladesh in 2007. When I left Myanmar, there wasn't any violence, but we had no rights. I had to bribe the government just to do business and move around where I wanted to.

We want to go back to our homeland, our farms, our cattle and our shelters. We miss these things. But we are trying to get more rights from Myanmar. If they don't give us citizenship, why would we want to go back there? The people are not free to work, do any kind of ritual, choose any kind of profession. It is hard for children to get an education and we cannot freely move.

I will return if the situation improves, and our kids can get an education, and our land is returned, so we can live like the other people in Rakhine. We want equality.

Feroza Khatum, 24, from Rathedaung Township

My daughter was thrown into the fire of a burning house by the Myanmar military. The military killed her. She was three and a half years old. I have no other children.

I will not return now because we have been oppressed and I remember that oppression. I do not hope to return.

We should have citizenship status and the military must assure the international community that they will not oppress us. But I don't believe we will be safe. I don't believe the military will change anytime soon. The Myanmar government must promise us stability, and the world must force them to obey.","arakan rohingya salvation army

Nathan Mattise,"Time Trap, Chasing the Blues, and Meerkat Moonship are cursed (as Ars’ favorite AFF indies).",2017-11-25T15:30:19+00:00,ars-technica,Not the four-letter kind: Familiar curses get new stories at the Austin Film Fest,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/not-the-four-letter-kind-familiar-curses-get-new-stories-at-the-austin-film-fest/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MEERKAT_1.569.1_preview-760x380.jpeg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"AUSTIN, Texas—If you’re not a regular Fantastic Fest attendee or a disciple of folks like Richard Linklater or Wes Anderson, it may surprise you just how much Austin, Texas, loves film. Just know there’s a reason major movie outfits like the Alamo Drafthouse and Mondo started and succeed here.

Within this sneaky cinema town, perhaps no event outpaces the annual Austin Film Festival & Conference. It’s a non-profit-led, eight-day movie love affair with panels devoted to screenwriting (both practical industry advice and folks like the team behind Arrival sharing insight on crafting believable sci-fi) and a wide-reaching film program. This year, buzzy A-list work like Armie Hammer’s Call Me By Your Name or Margot Robbie’s I, Tonya shared the schedule with “documentaries” about Apollo 18, actual documentaries on famed political cartoonists, and a slew of independent filmmakers (from both Texas and beyond). Further Reading Anna and the Apocalypse: A zombie-Christmas-high school musical can’t be this good

That last category caught our eye in particular because of an unexpected overarching theme—curses. Among the handful of films we managed to catch, many relied on an inexplicable, supernatural omen to bring the story together. Luckily, none of ‘em left us muttering the four-letter variety on the way out. Instead, each took a familiar brand of ominous curse and used it within a new context.

Time for all the films in Time Trap

Ben Foster and Mark Dennis, the Texas team behind Time Trap (and former festival darling Strings), evidently grew up on the same ‘80s movies many of us did. An academic archaeologist has a dangerous pursuit in mind that may or may not involve an otherworldly relic. A group of kids takes on an adventure larger than they could fathom in order to save a friend. And as part of a school project, students inadvertently end up with people from multiple time periods running around within the same space.

Those ideas happened in separate ‘80s films, of course—but Time Trap audaciously strives to mix ‘em all together in a not-so-straightforward adventure flick. The Indiana Jones-ish professor here is named Professor Hopper, and he knows of a local urban legend that involves an entire family gone missing while exploring a cave somewhere nearby. Hopper tells a group of his best students that he thinks he’s recently found the spot. And when the professor soon goes silent for several days, the students (along with their kid sibling and her friend) suddenly must take up the search, too.

Time Trap wears its inspirations on its sleeve and has fun doing it. For instance, the younger sibling’s pal is a rotund, long-haired, annoying boy nicknamed Furby. When he expresses a bit of nervousness about dropping down into a cave, student Taylor has a winky line ready and waiting. “Relax,” he tells Furby. “It’s not The Goonies.” (“What’s The Goonies?” the kid asks. “You do look like Chunk,” another student replies.) The film also references the Holy Grail/fountain of youth, and at least one character possesses an Indiana Jones-and-snakes-like fear of spiders.

The curse in Time Trap comes into play late in the film after the group of students successfully deciphers exactly what is happening to people when they enter this cave. (That process happens through some clever deductive reasoning via smart phone footage.) It doesn’t turn the film tonally into a horror; it doesn’t stand-in for any profound lesson. Instead, Time Trap’s curse is ultimately what allows its dizzying array of varied genre-inspirations to co-exist within a single story. Without spoiling anything, even if you can foresee this twist, you can’t predict how it winds up for our present-day heroes. As a coherent story, it mostly works. But what you’ll walk away admiring most is the film’s ambition.

Time Trap is currently within the film festival circuit, including a January screening at Japan’s Yubari Fantastic Fest. Follow its Facebook page for future screening dates, distribution news, and evidently an endorsement from Kathie Lee.

Listen and die with Chasing The Blues

Stop us if you’ve heard this one before—a cursed piece of media causes bad things to happen to anyone who comes in contact with it. However, Chasing The Blues is distinctly not like The Ring. Instead, this film takes the same basic curse concept and transports it into a comedy about vinyl-obsessed music nerds.

Back in the late 1980s, Alan taught music history at a local Chicago school. And his favorite shop in the city, located on the other side of town, belonged to Paul. The two share of a love of blues, and it’s quickly evident they’re frenemies at best. “This is the people’s music,” Paul tells Alan as the latter flips through the stacks and complains about the asking price for what he sees as pedestrian records. “A blues snob is an oxymoron; a white blues snob is just a moron.”

One day, Alan gets a tip that an elderly black woman near Paul’s shop recently lost her husband... who left behind a giant vintage record collection. Even better, this collection is rumored to contain a ultra-rare copy of Jimmy Kane Baldwin’s only single, “O Death, Where’s Thy Sting?” It’s one of just four pressings in circulation because, well, the people in that studio back in the 1930s all mysteriously died shortly after the recording session. Unbeknownst to the studio exec or session musicians, Baldwin was wanted for murder in Louisiana when he beelined up to Chicago to record. Evidently, certain listeners can hear screams in the background of the chorus, and those people usually suffer tragedy soon after.

Chasing The Blues mostly focuses on the love/hate relationship between Alan and Paul and how the duo encounters more and more absurd bad happenings in pursuit of the cursed record. (Luckily, Grant Rosenmeyer, aka one of The Royal Tenenbaums kids, and Ronald L. Conner work together charmingly as Alan and Paul.) On the milder end, the duo ends up spending the better part of a week living with this elderly woman in order to befriend her for the album (and ensure the other guy doesn’t do it first). “These aren’t worth much anymore, people are switching to compact discs—digital is the future,” Alan tells the woman at one point. “It sounds like you’re in the room with musicians, and I hear they last forever. In 100 years, you’ll still have the same albums you have today.”

The story bounces around time periods while crime and death occur. But Chasing the Blues keeps its audience smirking throughout as these two adults try to screw each other over a record that would supposedly ruin them anyway. “I can’t explain why this supposedly cursed-by-the-devil record made me move into someone else’s apartment, made me abandon my own life,” Alan tells someone on a bus later in the film. Well, that’s simply what curses do, Alan. They operate in mysterious ways.

Chasing The Blues is currently within the festival scene, including an upcoming screening at the Anchorage International Film Festival in Alaska. Follow its Facebook page for notices about upcoming screenings or distribution announcements (the film has also compiled its referenced blues tracks in a Spotify playlist; you've been warned about ""O Death, Where Is Thy Sting?"")

Hanneke Schutte

Life and curses in Meerkat Moonship

Meerkat Moonship may likely be the most traditional curse movie we caught at AFF 2017, or, at least it seems like a traditional curse movie. But South African filmmaker Hanneke Schutte’s quiet film offers more depth and artistry than other tales of the young and ill-fated.

We meet young Gideonette as she’s watching community theater with her father, and the production tells the story of a local monster that preys on young kids in the woods. But the monster on stage soon appears to be a metaphor—off-stage, the local village is convinced the name Gideon is what’s cursed. Several prior Gideons in town met early and unfortunate demises, so Gideonette’s preacher/father named her as such to demonstrate to his parishioners that this was BS.

Gideonette initially believes her father, but slowly her confidence erodes. A series of unfortunate events leads Gideonette to fear some kind of monster constantly lurking around the corner, conveniently looking like the troll-ish thing from the play. After being shipped to her grandparents to get away from the toxic community, she’s scared to even step outside.

That is, until she meets young Bhubesi. Bhubesi is a younger deaf boy who lives down the street from Gideonette’s grandparents, and he has been working with Grandpa on a longterm project to build a spaceship that looks like a meerkat (and may be an extravagant treehouse to non-believers). Bhubesi constantly carries his space helmet and a notebook with his illustrated astronaut plans around, fearlessly enjoying the many wooded areas in the neighborhood without fear of wildlife, creaky bridges, or slippery rocks on the water.

Gideonette initially only watches Bhubesi’s adventures from her window, but the kid’s charming antics and constant invitation eventually help shake the girl out of her fear of the unknown. The adventures these two go on—interspersed with behind-the-scenes conversations Grandpa and Grandma have about the village and Gideonette’s parents—represent the strongest parts of the film. (Meerkat Moonship filmed in a rain forest in Limpopo, South Africa, and the setting is as picturesque as you'd expect). Imagination and companionship allow a young girl to have her childhood back following tragedy, and her caring grandparents debate how much reality to let seep into this dream adventure throughout.

But like all of these films, curses prove to be curses for a reason—bad stuff does unexpectedly happen. No monster has been after Gideonette this entire time, but life itself proves it can be monstrous: death lurks over everyone to various degrees, even the adults we trust most (and seem most sane) can fall prey to illness or paranoia, and all adventures end (even those involving imaginary meerkat-like spaceships). Yet no matter how dark it gets for Gideonette, Meerkat Moonship does not subscribe to nihilism in the end. Instead, she perseveres through a rough patch with the encouragement of friends and loved ones. Growing up can be both a curse and a blessing, after all.

Meerkat Moonship is currently on the festival circuit. Follow along with its Facebook page for future information on screenings and distribution; its South African premiere is March 16, 2018.

Samuel Axon,iPhone app and game devs assess the iPhone X and share experiences with it.,2017-11-25T15:00:57+00:00,ars-technica,How app developers and designers feel about the iPhone X—and the notch,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/how-devs-updated-their-apps-for-the-iphone-xs-screen-and-the-notch/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-21-at-3.44.54-PM-760x380.png,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The heart of the iPhone X's pitch is third-party apps. From augmented reality features to the TrueDepth sensor, the new features are meant to stir creativity and action in the developer community, bringing innovative new app experiences to iPhone X users. But even as Apple gives developers new toys to play with, it also has to make sure it doesn't break their old ones.

The iPhone X is the most significant change to the iPhone in several years. It has a higher resolution and a different screen shape. It disposes of the home button and adds or changes touch gestures. Every one of those changes could create work for designers and developers... and then there’s the notch. You can expect more phones to do this, not just from Apple. But how do you design around it? How much work is it to adapt an app for it? Is it, as some critics say, bad design?

To find out, I spoke with designers and developers of apps and games for iOS who recently went through the process of updating their apps for the iPhone X. I wanted to ask some of these very questions, but by and large I wanted to hear how the transition to the new phone went for everyone working behind the scenes.

The apps from developers we interviewed

Snowman

Yak & co

Basecamp

Galley Foods

infltr

A bump in resolution

Let's start by looking at the changes and challenges presented by a differently sized and shaped screen and how Apple recommends coping with them. Because iOS runs on devices at a variety of resolutions, Apple and developers on the platform measure their user interfaces in “points” rather than pixels—which is a very common concept in design, anyway. The iPhone X’s display has the same width in points as the iPhone 7 and 8 (375 points), but it is 145 points taller. The fact that the iPhone X shares its width with the regular iPhones and not the Plus models is why it doesn’t support the expanded landscape mode interfaces that you get on the Plus.

iOS apps also need to support displaying assets at multiple resolutions to look sharp at each device’s screen resolution; the signifiers @1x, @2x, or @3x are used for the three tiers of resolution for assets. Apple recommends producing assets as PDFs because they are resolution independent. If rasterized images are also needed, they currently must be offered in both @2x or @3x, which previously correlated to the standard-sized modern iPhones with retina displays and the Plus models, respectively. The iPhone X uses @3x.

Every developer I spoke with said they didn't have any trouble with assets looking good on the new screen. Phillippe Levieux, co-founder behind photo editing app infltr, even enjoyed the new approach:

We are using vector assets inside infltr, they are PDFs. We didn't have to make any changes for the iPhone X. This way of working is incredible. You only need one PDF asset that will be compiled into @1x, @2x, @3x.

Yak & Co Art Director Mark White (known for the adventure game Agent A) said his team weathered the asset transition well, and he framed it as a lesson that you should always expect the unexpected and implement accordingly. ""We made the conscious effort early on to design things in a very flexible way because you really just can’t predict what kind of resolutions or screen shapes we’ll be running in the future,"" he said.

But resolution has changed on the iPhone before without major event. The iPhone X makes three additional changes that developers haven't had to contend with before. The corners are rounded, whereas other iPhones have had corners with right angles. There’s the controversial notch—Apple calls it the sensor housing—an intrusion of the camera and other hardware into the middle of the top of the screen. And finally, there's also a new indicator in the UI that is ever present at the bottom of the screen.

The home indicator

iPhone apps used to have the entire screen to themselves most of the time—the only exceptions were the status bar and notifications—but that's no longer the case. They have to cede real estate to the notch at the top and the home indicator at the bottom.

Apple already offered a set of rules and tools called Auto Layout to help iOS developers avoid potential pitfalls with using blocked-off real estate on prior iOS devices. The company describes it this way:

Auto Layout dynamically calculates the size and position of all the views in your view hierarchy, based on constraints placed on those views. For example, you can constrain a button so that it is horizontally centered with an Image view and so that the button’s top edge always remains 8 points below the image’s bottom. If the image view’s size or position changes, the button’s position automatically adjusts to match.

For developers who were already leaning primarily on Auto Layout, the transition to the iPhone X is much simpler than it is for those relying mostly on custom layouts. ""My app uses Auto Layout for most of its drawing code,"" said Galley Foods engineering head Chris Anderson. ""So I only had to do minimal work to fit my app to the new dimensions. You recompile with iOS 11, sprinkle some 'if iOS 11' statements to pin your app to the new Apple-provide safe layout guide, and that got me most of the way to the finish line.""

Apple added a new aspect to Auto Layout called the Safe Area in iOS 11. Based on the Safe Area, developers should confine content and critical UI elements to parts of the screen where they wouldn't be blocked or interfered with by the hardware or system software. For other iPhones, the Safe Area was essentially the entire viewport. On the iPhone X, though, it's more complicated. In portrait mode, the Safe Area blocks off part of the top of the viewpoint and part of the bottom. The top is to accommodate the status bar and the sensor housing, while the bottom gives a wide berth to the home indicator.

The home indicator is a thin bar that is almost always present at the bottom of the screen to indicate to the user that they can swipe up from the bottom to exit the app or reach the multitasking interface. Since this functionality was previously performed by the home button that sat below the screen, you could see the indicator as the new home button in a way. Apple allows developers to enable an auto-hide behavior for the home indicator, but only for viewing full-screen passive content like videos.

Alternatively, developers can activate Edge Protection. This gives the indicator a more subtle appearance, making the user perform two swipes instead of one to get out of the app. This is recommended if a swipe from the bottom is a core part of an app’s functionality, though obviously the best solution is to change that interaction to something else when possible. Apple nevertheless recommends vertically scrollable views extending all the way to the bottom of the display despite the indicator’s presence.

Developers who put UI elements like navigation buttons at the very bottom of the screen might have to move them if they previously rested outside of what is now the Safe Area. Galley Foods' Anderson said that despite his relatively easy transition, this was the biggest problem he encountered in his app:

First, I had a lot of bottoms and actions pinned to the bottom of the screen; all of these required manual intervention (even with Auto Layout) to make sure the indicator line wasn't covering up the button. Second, getting the spacing to look right required some manual tweaking for iPhone X and non-iPhone X layouts. And lastly, I'm still struggling on how to best design around that home indicator. With a bottom pinned button, you can either extend the button color to the bottom or cut it off above the line. Both are somewhat ugly options. The curved edges require you to give lots of spacing above the curve; so there are these extra margins that don't look right.

The more developers stuck to Apple's recommended ways of doing things, the easier the company made the transition for them. Still, Anderson said he felt Apple could have provided better guidance on handling the bottom bar in visually appealing ways. ""With giant tab bars and the empty space below the on-screen keyboard, I think Apple themselves haven't figured out what to do,"" he added.","phillippe levieux

John Timmer,"Gamma rays produced by lightning hit atomic nuclei, transforming them.",2017-11-25T12:30:32+00:00,ars-technica,Lightning strikes leave behind a radioactive cloud,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/lightning-strikes-leave-behind-a-radioactive-cloud/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lightning_safety_300-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Thunderstorms have a lot of overt indications of power, from the thunder and lightning to torrential rains and hail. But the full extent of their power wasn't obvious until recent years, when we discovered they generate antimatter. Now, researchers in Japan have looked at this phenomenon more closely and determined that a lightning bolt generates a zone that contains unstable isotopes of oxygen and nitrogen, leading to series of radioactive decays over the next minute.

Transformative

All of these phenomena are powered by the fact that the electric fields within thunderstorms are able to accelerate electrons to extremely high energies. Whenever these electrons move along a curved path, they emit radiation that's proportional to their energy. As a result, a storm can be associated with bursts of gamma rays, extremely high-energy photons.

Gamma rays rays are primarily noted for their interaction with the electrons of any atoms they run into—it's why they're lumped in the category of ionizing radiation. But they can also interact with the nucleus of the atom. With sufficient energy, they can kick out a neutron from some atoms, transforming them into a different isotope. Some of the atoms this occurs with include the most abundant elements in our atmosphere, like nitrogen and oxygen. And, in fact, elevated neutron detections had been associated with thunderstorms in the past.

But a team in Japan managed to follow what happens with the transformed atomic nucleus. To do so, they set up a series of detectors on the site of a nuclear power plant and watched as thunderstorms rolled in from the Sea of Japan. As expected, these detectors picked up a flash of high-energy photons associated with a lightning strike, the product of accelerated electrons. These photons came in a variety of energies and faded back to background levels within a couple of hundred milliseconds.

But about 10 seconds later, the number of gamma rays started to go back up again, and this stayed elevated for about a minute. In contrast to the broad energy spectrum of the initial burst, these were primarily in the area of 500 kilo-electronVolts. That happens to be the value you'd get if you converted an electron's mass into energy.

Unstable

What's going on here? The researchers suggest that this is a product of the atoms left behind when neutrons were ejected. In the case of the most common isotope of nitrogen, 14N, this leaves behind 13N, which is unstable and has a short half-life. The same is true for 15O, which is left behind when the most common form of oxygen kicks out a neutron. These unstable isotopes will typically decay in a matter of seconds, which is right about the time frame for the afterglow the researchers were detecting.

(The neutrons that are kicked out typically recombine with other atoms. For example, adding a neutron to 14N causes it to kick out a proton, which forms a hydrogen atom. The remaining nucleus is 14C, a relatively long-lived radioactive isotope of carbon.)

The 500keV photons the authors were seeing weren't a direct product of the radioactive decay. Instead, 13N and 15O decay by releasing a neutrino and a positron, the antimatter equivalent of the electron. These positrons will then bump into an electron in the environment and annihilate it, converting each of the particles into a gamma ray with the energy equivalent of the electron's mass. That's exactly the energy the researchers were detecting.

The authors suggest that a lightning bolt creates an entire region in the atmosphere enriched with unstable nitrogen and oxygen, which they managed to detect as it drifted over their sensors: ""A region, or ‘cloud,’ filled with these isotopes emits positrons for more than 10 minutes and moves by wind above our detectors without experiencing much diffusion, owing to a low mobility of the isotopes,"" the team wrote.

This doesn't mean that thunderstorms are major radiation risks. But over time, the storms collectively provide a small influence on the isotopes that comprise Earth's atmosphere. We're apparently not just limited to the carbon that was here when the Earth formed; instead, we've made a bit of our own since.

Jon Brodkin,Bad news for Google Fiber: Nashville utility pole ordinance invalidated by judge.,2017-11-24T20:30:15+00:00,ars-technica,AT&T and Comcast lawsuit has nullified a city’s broadband competition law,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/att-and-comcast-win-lawsuit-they-filed-to-stall-google-fiber-in-nashville/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-fiber-nashville-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"AT&T and Comcast have convinced a federal judge to nullify an ordinance that was designed to bring more broadband competition to Nashville, Tennessee.

The Nashville Metro Council last year passed a ""One Touch Make Ready"" rule that gives Google Fiber or other new ISPs faster access to utility poles. The ordinance lets a single company make all of the necessary wire adjustments on utility poles itself, instead of having to wait for incumbent providers like AT&T and Comcast to send work crews to move their own wires.

AT&T and Comcast sued the metro government in US District Court in Nashville, claiming that federal and local laws preempt the One Touch Make Ready rule. Judge Victoria Roberts agreed with AT&T and Comcast in a ruling issued Tuesday. Further Reading Comcast sues Nashville to halt rules that help Google Fiber

Google Fiber is offering service in Nashville despite saying last year that it was waiting for access to thousands of utility poles.

""We're reviewing [the] court ruling to understand its potential impact on our build in Nashville,"" a Google spokesperson said this week, according to The Tennessean. ""We have made significant progress with new innovative deployment techniques in some areas of the city, but access to poles remains an important issue where underground deployment is not a possibility.""

AT&T poles

The case centered on two sets of utility poles: those owned by AT&T and those owned by the municipal Nashville Electric Service (NES).

The Nashville ordinance is preempted by federal law when it comes to poles owned by AT&T and other private parties, the judge ruled. The Federal Communications Commission has jurisdiction to regulate pole attachments for privately owned poles except when states opt out of the federal regime.

""Tennessee has not opted out of FCC jurisdiction over pole attachments,"" Judge Roberts wrote.

In August, a similar One Touch Make Ready rule in Louisville, Kentucky, survived despite another AT&T lawsuit. Kentucky is one of 20 states that has opted out of the federal pole attachment regime, giving Louisville a leg up over AT&T in that case.

Utility-owned poles

While AT&T owns nearly 20 percent of the poles, the NES utility owns around 80 percent.

AT&T and Comcast argued that NES has sole authority to regulate the terms of pole attachments for NES-owned poles and that the Metro Nashville Council therefore overstepped its authority.

The court agreed with AT&T and Comcast's argument, saying, ""It is clear that the [Metro Nashville] Charter grants NES broad, unencumbered power to manage and control the properties of the Electric Power Board. It expressly denies that power to the Mayor, the Council, and any other agency of the Metro Nashville government.""

The court declined to make a final ruling on NES-owned poles, but AT&T and Comcast could get what they want soon. Nashville Metro argued that the claim should be dismissed because NES failed to join the case despite being an ""indispensable party."" But the judge is letting AT&T and Comcast amend their complaints in order to add NES as a party in the case.

NES previously told the court that it is ""agnostic to the validity of the ordinance."" Unless NES changes course, a ruling would be automatically entered in favor of AT&T and Comcast.

NES will be asked to make a statement on whether it intends to take a position. ""If it continues to have no position, the Court will enter the declaration and injunction sought by Plaintiffs,"" the judge wrote.

Nashville Metro could appeal the ruling, but hasn't said whether it will do so. ""We are reviewing the court's decision and will make a determination regarding our next course of action in the near future,"" Jon Cooper, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry's law director, told The Tennessean.","jon cooper nashville mayor megan barrys

John Timmer,Tests energies thousands of times higher than accelerators can go.,2017-11-24T17:00:56+00:00,ars-technica,IceCube turns the planet into a giant neutrino detector,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/icecube-detector-uses-entire-earth-to-measure-interactions-of-neutrinos/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LabCartoon_IceCube_5760-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Neutrinos are one of the most plentiful particles out there, as trillions pass through you every second. But they're incredibly hard to work with. They're uncharged, so we can't control their path or accelerate them. They're also nearly massless and barely interact with other matter, so they're hard to detect. All of this means that a lot of the predictions our physics theories make about neutrinos are hard to test.

The IceCube detector, located at the South Pole, has now confirmed a part of the Standard Model of physics, which describes the properties of fundamental particles and their interactions. According to the Standard Model, neutrinos should become more likely to interact with other particles as their energy goes up. To test this, the IceCube team used neutrinos thousands of times more energetic than our best particle accelerators can make and used the entire planet as a target.

Polar cube

IceCube consists of hundreds of detectors buried in the ice under the South Pole. These detectors pick up particles that move through the ice. In some cases, IceCube sees a spray of particles and photons when something slams into one of the atoms in the ice. In other cases, particles simply nudge the atoms, liberating a few photons. There's no neutrino source pointed at IceCube, though. Instead, it relies on natural sources of neutrinos. Some of these are produced far away in space, and travel great distances to Earth. Others are produced as cosmic rays slam into the atmosphere.

In either case, their energies can be immense compared to the best our particle accelerators can do. For the new work, the data included neutrinos with energies as high as 980 Tera-electronVolts. For comparison, the Large Hadron Collider accelerates its protons to a mere 6.5TeV—and only smaller accelerators are used to produce neutrinos.

Because of these immense energies, IceCube is well placed to test a Standard Model prediction: neutrinos are more likely to interact with matter at higher energies. (Physicists refer to the probability of an interaction as a ""cross section."") While we've tested this with neutrinos that are produced by some particle accelerators, the tests have only covered a narrow range of energies at the low end of the spectrum. While these tests agreed with the Standard Model, the energies involved never got high enough for the cross section to change.

If IceCube relied only on the neutrinos that interacted with matter within the detector, however, it would take years to build up enough collisions to test things. So instead, the IceCube team used the entire Earth. It's able to detect the path particles take as they pass through the detector. So the team was able to identify neutrinos that passed through the detector by entering on the side. These would be neutrinos that intercepted the Earth tangentially at the South Pole itself and so interacted with very little matter.

These were compared to particles that arrived from beneath and therefore passed through much of the Earth on the way. At low energies, neutrino interactions are so uncommon that this makes little difference. At sufficiently high energies, however, the Earth should provide a test of interaction frequencies.

Still the Standard

As predicted, the number of neutrinos arriving through the Earth dropped compared to the ones coming in tangentially. And their frequency dropped further as a product of energy. While there were still more neutrinos arriving than predicted by the Standard Model, the experimental uncertainty was large enough that the results were completely consistent with our theory.

Across the energy range involved here, the increase in interactions went up in a linear fashion as the energy increased. But there was a slight hint of a curve in the data. This is expected because neutrinos interact with regular matter via two particles called the W and Z bosons. Their mass causes a slight deviation from the linear relationship. We'll need more data to really know for sure, but the new analysis was only done with a single year's worth of data from IceCube, and we have six additional years to work with. So expect to hear more on that soon.

The high end of the energy range, at 980TeV, was set simply by the fact that there were very few neutrinos at energies above that. Again, with more data, we should be able to extend this analysis out further. That's rather important, because there are a number of hypothetical ideas—extra dimensions, undiscovered particles called leptoquarks—that call for the rate of interactions to increase dramatically at high energies. So we might be closing in on testing some of these ideas.

Meanwhile, the IceCube people have also been talking with geologists. In a video announcing their results, they note that some of the neutrinos that pass through the Earth will go through the core and others will graze through while avoiding it. With enough data, this will allow us to get a sense of the material properties of the Earth's core, something that's been notoriously difficult to sample.

""We have an ongoing dialogue with a lot of tech companies in a variety of different areas,"" he recently told Politico Pro. ""There [are] some areas where they are cooperative with us. But on this particular issue of encryption, the tech companies are moving in the opposite direction. They’re moving in favor of more and more warrant-proof encryption.""

Ars Live: How to build weird things on the Internet and influence people View more stories While the battle against encryption has been going on within federal law enforcement circles (dubbed ""going dark"") since at least the early 1990s, Rosenstein has now called for ""responsible encryption.""

But as Riana Pfefferkorn, a legal fellow at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, told a recent assembled crowd at Ars Technica Live, it’s not clear entirely how that responsibility should be laid out.

""I think what Rosenstein is getting at is that he believes that companies in their deployment of encryption should be responsible to law enforcement above all and public safety rather than being responsible to their users or the broader security ecosystem,"" she said.

Further Reading DOJ: Strong encryption that we don’t have access to is “unreasonable” She indicated that it may be the case, in light of recent failures to prevent Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, that the Department of Justice may sense ""blood in the water"" as a way to aggressively push Congress to take action against companies like Apple and Google.

But, she noted, the Trump-era DOJ isn’t very much different, at least when it comes to crypto policy, as the Obama-era DOJ was.

""Overall, there has not necessarily been a shift in the way that law enforcement present their case to the public,"" she said.

As Ars wrote about in 2015, the DOJ’s arguments against encryption haven’t changed much since the early 1990s, when the Clipper Chip was introduced.

Further Reading What the government should’ve learned about backdoors from the Clipper Chip In July 2015, an all-star team of cryptographers and computers scientists reached largely the same conclusion that they did years earlier.

""The complexity of today’s Internet environment, with millions of apps and globally connected services, means that new law enforcement requirements are likely to introduce unanticipated, hard-to-detect security flaws,"" they wrote in a research paper. ""Beyond these and other technical vulnerabilities, the prospect of globally deployed exceptional access systems raises difficult problems about how such an environment would be governed and how to ensure that such systems would respect human rights and the rule of law.""

But as Pfefferkorn noted, it’s been a truism of law enforcement that each time it seeks a new authority, its labels that authority as merely a modernization of its existing powers and not something new.

However, the consensus of information security experts says that it is impossible to build the strongest encryption system possible that would also allow the government access under certain conditions.

In other words, modern, easy-to-use, on-by-default, strong encryption is a game changer.

So, if the government gets what it wants, then an infosec axiom will be realized.

""If strong crypto is outlawed, only outlaws will have strong crypto,"" she said.

Timothy B. Lee,From the archives: How this quartet nearly got fired for it.,2017-11-24T15:13:48+00:00,ars-technica,How four Microsoft engineers proved that the “darknet” would defeat DRM,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/how-four-microsoft-engineers-proved-copy-protection-would-fail/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/437000642_64a5c05572_o-640x215.jpeg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"It's Thanksgiving week in the US, and most of our staff is focused on a morning coffee or Black Friday list rather than office work. As such, we're resurfacing this story of four Microsoft engineers who predicted the downfall of DRM more than a decade ahead of its time (their paper turned 15 this month). This story originally ran on November 30, 2012, and it appears unchanged below.

Can digital rights management technology stop the unauthorized spread of copyrighted content? Ten years ago this month, four engineers argued that it can't, forever changing how the world thinks about piracy. Their paper, ""The Darknet and the Future of Content Distribution"" (available as a .doc here) was presented at a security conference in Washington, DC, on November 18, 2002.

By itself, the paper's clever and provocative argument likely would have earned it a broad readership. But the really remarkable thing about the paper is who wrote it: four engineers at Microsoft whose work many expected to be at the foundation of Microsoft's future DRM schemes. The paper's lead author told Ars that the paper's pessimistic view of Hollywood's beloved copy protection schemes almost got him fired. But ten years later, its predictions have proved impressively accurate.

The paper predicted that as information technology gets more powerful, it will grow easier and easier for people to share information with each other. Over time, people will assemble themselves into what the authors called the ""darknet."" The term encompasses formal peer-to-peer networks such as Napster and BitTorrent, but it also includes other modes of sharing, such as swapping files over a local area network or exchanging USB thumb drives loaded with files.

Once a popular piece of information—say, a movie, a song, or a software title—""leaks"" into the darknet, stopping its spread becomes practically impossible. This, the engineers realized, had an important implication: to prevent piracy, digital rights management had to work not just against average users, but against the most tech-savvy users on the planet. It only takes a single user to find a vulnerability in a DRM scheme, strip the protection from the content, and release the unencrypted version to the darknet. Then millions of other users merely need to know how to use ordinary tools such as BitTorrent to get their own copies.

Trusted computing or treacherous computing?

Ars Technica talked to Peter Biddle, the paper's lead author, last week. The basic premise of the paper came from an e-mail Biddle circulated within Microsoft in the late 1990s. The term ""darknet"" was coined by co-author Bryan Willman, another Microsoft engineer. Two other Microsoft engineers, Paul England and Marcus Peinado, contributed to it.

At the time they wrote the paper, Biddle and his co-authors were working on Microsoft's ""Trusted Windows"" project, an effort to provide hardware-level authentication features that could make PCs resistant to tampering even by those who have physical access and control. The initiative would go under a variety of names, including Palladium, TCPA, and the Next-Generation Secure Computing Base.

Biddle, who now works at Intel but stressed that he was speaking only for himself in our interview, told us that it was a project fraught with political challenges. Inside Microsoft, people bristled at the implication that vanilla Windows was untrustworthy. Outside Microsoft, critics charged that Biddle's project represented the beginning of the end for the PC as an open platform. They feared that Microsoft would use the technology to exert control over which software could be executed on Windows PCs, freezing out open source operating systems and reducing users' freedom to run the software of their choice.

One widely discussed application for Biddle's technology was digital rights management. Building DRM atop an open, general-purpose computing platform is an inherently difficult problem. Every DRM scheme requires distributing encryption keys or other secrets to users' devices without the users themselves having access to them. But on an open PC, the user has the ability to inspect and modify essentially all data stored on the device, so DRM schemes are inherently insecure.

It was ""very challenging for the PC industry to make the same kinds of statements around how secure data could be on the PC compared to closed devices like CE boxes,"" Biddle told us. Many hoped (or feared) that a ""trusted"" computing platform could dramatically improve a DRM scheme's tamper-resistance by preventing a machine's owner from inspecting sensitive encryption keys or modifying DRM code. But preventing users from modifying DRM schemes also inherently meant reducing users' control over the devices they owned. The risk of Microsoft locking down everyone's PC provoked an online backlash, with critics calling the technology ""treacherous computing.""

Biddle says that backlash ""took us completely by surprise."" He told us that his team didn't ""realize the level of entrenchment and fear"" about the ways Microsoft might misuse the technology. In his view, the public overreacted to what was designed to be an application-agnostic security technology. ""A lot of the things that were said about trustworthy computing being treacherous were actually impossible,"" he told us.

“I almost got fired”

Biddle says that he and his team realized early on that DRM technology would never succeed in shutting down piracy. He hoped that writing a paper saying so would reassure Microsoft's critics in the technical community that Redmond wasn't planning to lock down the PC in order to satisfy Hollywood. And by making it clear that the people behind Microsoft's ""trusted computing"" push were not fans of DRM, Biddle hoped he could persuade the technical community to consider other, more benign applications of the technology he was building.

Biddle couldn't be too candid about the link between his paper and the technology he was building. Explicitly admitting that DRM schemes built on ""Trusted Windows"" wouldn't stop piracy might make it harder for Microsoft to persuade content providers to license its products for Microsoft's technology platforms. Biddle hoped that releasing his paper at a technical security conference would allow him to send a ""dog whistle"" to the technology community without raising the ire of Hollywood.

It didn't work out that way. ""I almost got fired over the paper,"" Biddle told Ars. ""It was extremely controversial."" Biddle tried to get buy-in from senior Microsoft executives prior to releasing the paper. But he says they didn't really understand the paper's implications—and particularly how it could strain relationships with content companies—until after it was released. Once the paper was released, Microsoft's got stuck in bureaucratic paralysis. Redmond neither repudiated Biddle's paper nor allowed him to publicly defend it.

At the same time, ""the community we thought would draw a connection never drew the connection,"" Biddle said, referring to anti-DRM activists. ""Microsoft was taking so much heat around security and trustworthy computing, that I was not allowed to go out and talk about any of this stuff publicly. I couldn't explain 'guys, we're totally on your side. What we want is a program that's open.'""

A losing battle

While Biddle and his colleagues didn't succeed in allaying the fears of Palladium's critics, the paper's central arguments have held up well. The authors predicted that the emergence of the darknet would produce a technological and legal arms race. They thought content companies and law enforcement would attack those aspects of the darknet that were most centralized, but that the darknet would adapt through greater decentralization. And they predicted that efforts to build secure DRM schemes would continue to fail. All of their predictions have continued to hold true over the last decade.

Both content companies and the US government have pursued increasingly aggressive anti-piracy strategies. The Recording Industry Association of America sued thousands of alleged file-sharers during the last decade, and content companies have sued numerous file-sharing startups out of existence. In 2010, the federal government got into the act, using the powers of the recently passed PRO-IP Act to seize domains and other assets of alleged pirate sites. And they have even begun to arrest key figures in file-sharing networks.

Yet these increased enforcement efforts have barely slowed down the darknet's momentum. A key development has been the emergence of ""locker sites"" that host infringing files and ""link sites"" that provide pointers to those files.

""The thing about the locker and link sites is that they can be very lightweight,"" Biddle told us. They are ""not that hard to replicate because they are basically a database."" That makes the network as a whole much more robust to law enforcement efforts to shut it down: close down one site and two more pop up in its place.

And while BitTorrent and Megaupload get all the attention, Biddle notes that there are other file-sharing techniques that the government is never going to stop. ""Teenagers and twenty-somethings I know routinely will go over to a friend's house with a terabyte drive to swap stuff,"" he said. They choose the ""sneakernet"" approach less out of fear of liability than because it's so convenient. ""You can have a ton of content on a terabyte drive,"" he noted.

Yet the content industry continues to try, and fail, to produce secure DRM schemes. Biddle believes this strategy has proved counterproductive because it inconveniences legitimate customers without stopping piracy.

""I'm now finding that for some kinds of content, the illegal is clearly outperforming legal,"" Biddle said. ""That blows me away. I pay for premium cable. It's easier to use BitTorrent to watch Game of Thrones. HBO Go is trying very hard to do a good job,"" he said, but the user experience just isn't as good. Because HBO Go is a streaming service, he said, it's more vulnerable to network congestion than simply downloading the entire episode from the darknet.","recording industry association of america

When the violence finally stopped, more than 300 people, including 27 children, had been killed and 128 injured.

As the gunfire rang out and the blasts shook the mosque, worshippers screamed and cried out in pain. A stampede broke out in the rush toward a door leading to the washrooms. Others tried desperately to force their way out of the windows.

Those who survived spoke of children screaming as they saw parents and older brothers mowed down by gunfire or shredded by the blasts. Some marveled at their narrow escape from a certain death. Some families lost all or most male members in the massacre.

So composed were the militants that they methodically checked their victims for any sign of life after the initial round of blazing gunfire. Those still moving or breathing received a bullet to the head or the chest, the witnesses said. When the ambulances arrived they shot at them, repelling them as they got back into their vehicles and fled.

Friday's assault was Egypt's deadliest attack by Islamic extremists in the country's modern history, a grim milestone in a long-running fight against an insurgency led by a local affiliate of the Islamic State group. Al-Rawdah Mosque was in a sleepy village by the same name in Egypt's troubled northern Sinai, near the small town of Bir al-Abd.

A statement by the country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, said the attackers, some masked, numbered between 25 and 30. Those with bare faces sported heavy beards and long hair, it added. Clad in military-style camouflage pants and black T-shirts, one of them carried a black banner with the declaration of the Muslim faith — there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet. The banner matched those carried by IS, which has not claimed responsibility for the attack.

They also torched seven cars parked outside the mosque that belonged to worshippers, the statement added.

The chief prosecutor's statement was the most detailed account given by authorities and it generally agreed with what witnesses told The Associated Press on Saturday in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, where some of the wounded are hospitalized.

""We knew that the mosque was under attack by (militants),"" said witness Ebid Salem Mansour recalling the intense gunfire. Mansour, a 38-year-old worker in a nearby salt factory, said he had settled in Bir al-Abd three years ago to escape the bloodshed and fighting elsewhere in northern Sinai. He suffered two gunshot wounds to his legs on Friday.

""Everyone lay down on the floor and kept their heads down. If you raised your head you get shot,"" he said. ""The shooting was random and hysterical at the beginning and then became more deliberate. Whoever they weren't sure was dead or still breathing was shot dead.""

The militants were shouting Allahu Akbar, or God is great, as they fired at the worshippers and the children were screaming, Mansour added. ""I knew I was injured but I was in a situation that was much scarier than being wounded. I was only seconds away from a certain death,"" he said. Amid the shooting many worshippers recited their final prayers, he added.

Friday's attack targeted a mosque frequented by Sufis, members of a mystic movement within Islam. Islamic militants, including the local IS affiliate, consider Sufis heretics because of their less literal interpretations of the faith.

President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi vowed that the attack ""will not go unpunished"" and that Egypt would persevere with its war on terrorism. He did not specify what new steps might be taken. On Saturday, he ordered that a mausoleum be built in memory of the victims of Friday's attack and cancelled a visit to the Gulf Sultanate of Oman that was scheduled for next week.

The military and security forces have already been waging a tough and costly campaign against militants in the towns, villages and desert mountains of northern Sinai, and Egypt has been in a state of emergency since April. Across the country, thousands have been arrested in a crackdown on suspected Islamists as well as against other dissenters and critics, raising concerns about human rights violations.

Seeking to spread the violence, militants over the past year have carried out deadly bombings on churches in the capital of Cairo and other cities, killing dozens of Christians. The IS affiliate is also believed to be behind the 2016 downing of a Russian passenger jet that killed 224 people over Sinai, an incident that decimated the country's already ailing tourism industry.

Friday's assault was the first major militant attack on a Muslim congregation, and it eclipsed past attacks, even dating back to a previous Islamic militant insurgency in the 1990s. The death of so many civilians in one day recalls the killing of at least 600 in August 2013, when Egyptian security forces broke up two sit-in protests in Cairo by supporters of Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist president ousted by the military the previous month.

Another witness to Friday's attack said worshippers tried to jump out of windows as soon as the militants opened fire. ""The small door that leads to the corridor for the wash rooms was about the only one where worshippers rushed to escape,"" said a 38-year-old government employee who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation.

""There was a stampede. I fell down and then bodies piled up on top of me,"" he said.

The local IS group affiliate has targeted Sufis in the past.

Last year, the militants beheaded a leading local Sufi religious figure, the blind sheikh Suleiman Abu Heraz, and posted photos of the killing online. Islamic State group propaganda often denounces Sufis. In the January edition of an IS online magazine, a figure purporting to be a high level official in the Sinai affiliate of the group vowed to target Sufis, accusing them of idolatry and heretical ""innovation"" in religion and warning that the group will ""not permit (their) presence"" in Sinai or Egypt.

Millions of Egyptians belong to Sufi orders, which hold sessions of ritual chanting and dancing to draw the faithful closer to God. Sufis also hold shrines containing the tombs of holy men in particular reverence.

Islamic militants stepped up their campaign of violence in northern Sinai after the military ousted the elected but divisive Morsi. Authorities followed up with a fierce crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood group, jailing thousands.

The result has been a long, grinding conflict centered on el-Arish and nearby villages and towns in north Sinai. The militants have been unable to control territory, but the military and security forces have also been unable to bring security, as the extremists continuously carry out surprise attacks, mostly targeting outposts and convoys.

The attacks have largely focused on military and police and, more recently, Christians. Hundreds have been killed, although exact numbers are unclear. The militants have also assassinated individuals the group considers to be spies for the government or religious heretics. Egypt has also faced attacks by militants in its Western Desert.

The identical pattern in the aftermath of Friday's attack on a mosque in Sinai, which killed over 300 people, raises the question: Does Egypt have options left?

The military has thrown tanks, fighting vehicles, fighter-jets, warships and helicopter gunships along with tens of thousands of security forces in three years of conflict with extremists, including an affiliate of the Islamic State group in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula.

The area has been under emergency law for several years and the entire country since April. Security forces have forcibly evacuated areas adjacent to the border with Gaza, razing residents' houses and farmlands. They have blown up underground tunnels that authorities believe jihadis used to smuggle weapons and fighters in from neighboring Gaza, ruled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

These measures have shown few tangible results.

The firepower and troop deployments in Sinai have kept militants from holding territory but have not prevented them from carrying out assassinations that terrorize the population and launching deadly attacks on military and police posts and convoys and recently a daylight robbery in Sinai's largest town.

In a televised address, a livid Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Egypt's general-turned-president, pledged the use of ""brute force"" in response to Friday's attack. ""The armed forces and police will forcefully take revenge for our martyred sons and restore security and stability in the short period ahead,"" he vowed.

There is little public discussion of how to conduct the war and northern Sinai area is closed off to journalists, making it difficult to assess what's going on. In the overwhelmingly pro-government media, talk about the conflict is largely focused on cheering the military and police, commemorating their ""martyrs"" and urging the public to rally around el-Sissi.

The closest authorities came to admitting shortcomings was last month when el-Sissi removed the armed forces' chief of staff and top police generals after a planned attack on militants in the Western Desert went disastrously wrong. The operation left over a dozen counterterrorism police officers dead and exposed poor coordination among security and intelligence agencies.

It also illustrated the problem posed by Egypt's long desert border with Libya — a country mired in chaos and rife with armed Islamic militant groups — through which weapons and fighters can be smuggled. That has fueled a second front of militant violence in the west, with signs of arms movements to the Sinai extremists.

Egypt's response has been in line with a longstanding model of fighting a conventional war against an opposing army. Indeed, recent years have seen up to $15 billion in arms deals, largely for big-ticket items such as two helicopter carriers, submarines, assault helicopters and fighter jets.

But critics have called for a counterterrorism strategy in Sinai rather than the reliance on a conventional deployment of overwhelming force. There are some trained counterterrorism soldiers and police deployed, but most are poorly trained regular troops and police conscripts whose main skill is manning a checkpoint. Warplanes and attack helicopters have limits in a rugged mountain terrain that the militants know far better than the military does. And forces moving with tanks and heavy vehicles are often ambushed by the more agile militants using light arms, machine guns, roadside bombs and suicide bombers.

El-Sissi recently said security forces are hampered by the presence of civilians in Sinai, requiring extreme caution which benefits the insurgents. But critics say the military has been heavy-handed as is, deepening the distrust of local tribes who have long claimed discrimination.

Male family members are sometimes arrested if another member is suspected of militancy, according to Sinai rights activists. Soldiers and police at checkpoints are notorious for mistreating people, they say. Roads are often blocked and mobile phone services disrupted. Houses have been razed to clear zones for military control and people forcibly evacuated. Even those who oppose the militants become less likely to help security forces.

At the same time, the militants brutally intimidate residents from cooperating with security forces, kidnapping suspected collaborators and dumping their decapitated bodies on the streets of el-Arish, Rafah and other north Sinai towns for all to see.

So the locals provide the military with little actionable intelligence.

One suggestion has been for the military to arm local Sinai tribesmen hostile to the militants — like the Sunni Arab ""Awakening"" militias in Iraq that were created by the U.S. military and were a key part of defeating al-Qaida in the 2000s. Given the anger many tribesmen now feel after Friday's massacre, it's a scenario that is becoming less unthinkable.

The military, however, fears armed tribesmen could eventually turn against it.

Critics also contend the government's country-wide campaign against Islamists has pushed some young people toward the Islamic State group affiliate. The crackdown was launched against the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 after the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood member. Since then, thousands of Brotherhood members and other Islamists have been jailed. There have been accounts of younger Islamists being radicalized, some in prison, and turning to IS support.

The government contends that the Brotherhood is a terrorist group, intertwined with militants from the start.

Some believe the militants are gambling as they turn ever more brutal, risking a revolt by the populace. Hassan Khalaf, a local tribal elder, said many of those killed were already cooperating with the army and that they were likely targeted as an intimidation tactic. ""People are more determined now to stand against that inhuman and heartless bunch,"" he said.

CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe's former finance minister testified Saturday that armed, masked men in uniform abducted him from his home during the military operation leading to the ouster of longtime leader Robert Mugabe and held him for a week in an unidentified location, fueling debate about the legality of the popular, mostly peaceful takeover by the armed forces.",2017-11-25T18:54:13Z,associated-press,Zimbabwean minister describes raid during military takeover,https://apnews.com/2ae37b3747a844c2b7898eb2a6492a17,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:27476ad48b324b6689b3766c093bf4b7/3000.jpeg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwe's former finance minister testified Saturday that armed, masked men in uniform abducted him from his home during the military operation leading to the ouster of longtime leader Robert Mugabe and held him for a week in an unidentified location, fueling debate about the legality of the popular, mostly peaceful takeover by the armed forces.

The account by Ignatius Chombo came a day after a High Court judge, a retired general, ruled that the military's actions last week, which commanders described as a move against ""criminals"" around Mugabe, were legal. While some critics said it set a dangerous precedent, the decision by Judge George Chiweshe reinforced the military's assertion that it acted within the law even though it set off events, including impeachment proceedings and street demonstrations against the 93-year-old Mugabe, that ended his 37-year rule.

The joyful inauguration on Friday of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former top aide to Mugabe, showed that most Zimbabweans are happy to have a new leader who might take steps to revive the shattered economy and grant them more freedoms. Even so, perceptions that the abrupt political transition was constitutionally sound are important to Zimbabwe's new leadership, which must prepare for 2018 elections and seeks to attract foreign investment.

However, Chombo and two leaders of the ruling ZANU-PF party's youth league who said they were abducted by the military before being handed over days later to the police described experiences reminiscent of human rights violations that were a routine occurrence during Mugabe's rule. The three men have been linked to a party faction loyal to Mugabe's wife, Grace, whose presidential ambitions triggered the military intervention.

""I was in the custody of armed persons who were dressed in soldiers' uniforms,"" said Chombo, who has been charged with corruption. ""I don't know where I was taken to.""

He described in court how the raid in the early morning of Nov. 15 began with two explosions, one of which shook his home. Men entered his bedroom with AK-47 assault rifles pointed at him, his wife and his maid, then handcuffed and hustled him out of the house through a smashed living room window, blindfolding him with his own T-shirt, Chombo said.

A one-hour drive to an unidentified location led to days of custody during which interrogators told him that he had performed badly in his role as a government official and ruling party leader, he said. He said he was blindfolded most of the time and never saw his captors' faces. He was not assaulted and saw a doctor after requesting pills, but suffered lacerations during the forced exit from his home, falling several times while barefoot.

Several days ago, his captors told him to pack his things and they drove him home, he said. There, two cars with police were parked.

""They said, 'You are under arrest,'"" Chombo said.

Defense lawyer Lovemore Madhuku said it was obvious that Chombo was originally taken by state agents, likely the military, and that his constitutional rights had been violated because he was not taken to court within 48 hours of his detention. The police arrest, he said, was designed to provide legal cover for an illegal act.

""The military must know that there is a constitution in this country,"" Madhuku said. ""There's no such thing as a military arrest.""

However, state prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba said the police arrest of Chombo was lawful and that there was no evidence the ""armed men"" who previously held him belonged to the military.

The detained youth leaders, Kudzanai Chipanga and Innocent Hamandishe, have been accused of denigrating the military. All three men are now in police custody.

It's an agenda whose core items — tax cuts, a potential government shutdown, lots of leftover spending bills — could unravel just as easily as advance in factionalism, gamesmanship and a toxic political environment.

There's only a four-week window until a Christmas deadline, barely enough time for complicated negotiations even if December stays on the rails. And that's hardly a sure bet in President Donald Trump's capital.

Trump and congressional leaders plan a meeting Tuesday to discuss how to sidestep a shutdown and work though the legislative to-do list.

For the optimistic, it's plain that Democrats and Republicans have reasons to cooperate, particularly on spending increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies whose budgets otherwise would be frozen. An additional round of hurricane aid should be bipartisan, and efforts to reauthorize a popular health care program for children seem to be on track.

Republicans are advancing their cherished tax cut measure under special rules that mean Senate Democrats cannot use delaying tactics. The measure passed the House just before the Thanksgiving break and moves to the Senate floor this coming week.

After the Senate GOP's failure on health care this summer, the majority party is under enormous pressure to produce a victory on taxes. Still, GOP deficit hawks such as Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona remain uneasy about the overhaul.

While Democrats are largely sidelined on taxes, they hold leverage over a mix of budget-related issues.

First, there's the need to avert a government shutdown after a temporary spending bill expires on Dec. 8. The most likely scenario, congressional aides say, is for an additional extension until Christmas. On a parallel track are talks to raise spending limits that are keeping agency budgets essentially frozen unless those caps are raised. If that happens, then negotiations could begin in earnest on a massive catchall spending measure in hopes of having it signed into law by year's end.

Taxes have gotten all the attention so far, but the showdown over a potential shutdown right before Christmas could soon take center stage. Democrats are counting on GOP fears of a holiday season closure to ensure Republican concessions during December talks.

Both sides would have to make concessions that may upset partisans in either party. Just as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., fears a revolt on the right, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California risks an uprising on her left. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., round out the quartet of top negotiators.

""Everybody's got complicated politics. The chance of short-term failure is pretty high — short-term failure being a shutdown,"" said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist. ""But the four of them, assuming they don't want to shut the government down for a long time, are going to have to come to an accommodation.""

Talks on the spending caps are stuck, however, aides say. A GOP offer to lift the Pentagon budget by more than $54 billion next year and nondefense limits by $37 billion was rejected by Democrats demanding balance between the two sides of the ledger.

Long-delayed battles over immigration and Trump's promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border are huge obstacles. Many Democrats whose votes are needed on the spending bills insist they won't vote for any legislation that includes the wall. Trump remains dead set on his $1.6 billion request for a down payment on the project.

Those same Democrats also insist that Congress must act by year's end to protect immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and whose protected status is set to lapse next year. Trump backs the idea despite issuing an executive order reversing the Obama administration protections, starting next spring. Conservatives oppose drawing in the immigration issue to legislation to keep the government running.

Hurricane relief is adding one more wrinkle.

Congress has approved more than $50 billion in aid in response to a series of devastating hurricanes. The most recent request by the White House is the largest yet at $44 billion, but it's not nearly enough to satisfy the powerful Texas delegation, which is pressing behind the scenes for more.

""Completely inadequate,"" said Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas. ""We must do far more to rebuild, repair and allow Texans to return to normal as quickly as possible.""

Trump is a wild card. He warmed to the idea of cutting deals with Democrats after a September pact with Schumer and Pelosi to lift the government's debt ceiling.

He promised Democratic leaders that he would sign legislation to give the young immigrants legal status — provided border security is addressed as well.

But that demand on border security came with a long list of conditions subsequently added by the White House. Among them: building his Mexico border wall, overhauling the green card system and strengthening measures against people who stay after their visas expire.

Trump has not really engaged on the year-end agenda, however, and his impulsiveness could be a liability. He almost disowned an omnibus spending bill in May after media accounts portrayed the measure as a win for Democrats.","donald trumps capital trump

Justice Neil Gorsuch didn't disappoint them, just as he hasn't in his first seven months on the Supreme Court.

""Tonight I can report that a person can be both a publicly committed originalist and textualist and be confirmed to the Supreme Court,"" Gorsuch said to sustained applause from members of the Federalist Society, using terms by which conservatives often seek to distinguish themselves from more liberal judges.

The 50-year-old justice has been almost exactly what conservatives hoped for and liberals dreaded when he joined the court in April. He has consistently, even aggressively, lined up with the court's most conservative justices. He has even split with Chief Justice John Roberts, viewed by some as insufficiently conservative because of his two opinions upholding President Barack Obama's health law.

During arguments, Gorsuch has asked repeatedly about the original understanding of parts of the Constitution and laws, and he has raised questions about some long-standing court precedents, including the civil rights landmark ruling on ""one person, one vote.

Liberals' despair about Gorsuch goes beyond his judicial actions. He occupies a seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia which they thought Obama would get to fill. But Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama's nominee, a strategy that paid off when Donald Trump unexpectedly won the White House.

At the Federalist Society, Gorsuch recognized the improbable turn of events that led him from an appellate judgeship in his native Colorado to America's highest court.

If someone had told Gorsuch a year ago what would soon transpire, ""I would have said that you had taken way too much advantage of my home state's generous drug laws,"" he said.

Gorsuch likes to remind audiences of his relative youth, despite his head of silver hair, suggesting a long tenure on the bench. In front of a nonpartisan audience last month, he talked about his teenage daughters and the regular, early morning 17-mile bike rides along the C&O canal that he does with a friend.

He spoke fondly of the horses, goats, chickens and rabbits on the small farm where his family lived outside Boulder, Colorado, before moving to the Washington area this year. He enthusiastically recounted ski outings and his favorite moguls.

Early reviews of Gorsuch's time on the court have varied with the ideological bent of his reviewers.

While his confirmation was pending, the liberal Alliance for Justice worried that Gorsuch would often embrace the most conservative outcome on the high court.

""Our concerns were confirmed,"" said Nan Aron, the group's president.

Daniel Epps, a Washington University law professor in St. Louis and onetime law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy, said he finds Gorsuch's style sometimes grating, less so the substance of his questions at arguments.

During a high-profile argument about politics in redistricting in October, Gorsuch began a question by suggesting that ""maybe we can just for a second talk about the arcane matter, the Constitution.""

To Epps, the tone was all wrong, especially for the new guy on the nine-member court. ""I'd love to see a bit more recognition that the court deals with really hard questions that many people, including his colleagues, have struggled with for a long time. If someone thinks he has all the answers, maybe he's missing something important,"" Epps said.

Some of Gorsuch's choices of where to speak — with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., at the Trump International Hotel and at the Federalist Society dinner — also have fed perceptions that rubbed his critics the wrong way.

The dinner, Aron said, ""was just the latest stop on Neil Gorsuch's thank you tour to honor the people who got him what should have been Merrick Garland's job."" Garland, an appeals court judge, the Obama nominee whom the Senate blocked.

""I think he could have done a better job certainly in the public appearances he chooses to make to sort of send the signal that he's not a Republican justice, he's a justice,"" said Epps, who also co-hosts the Supreme Court-focused First Mondays podcast.

His co-host, Ian Samuel, said there has been ""a hysterical overreaction"" to Gorsuch's questions in the courtroom. Samuel, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Scalia law clerk, said Gorsuch has an obvious interest in questions about accountability in the American system of government and control over the court system. ""It's better that he puts it out there and says this is who I am. I don't think he cares whether some people think it's shocking,"" Samuel said.

Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president who has advised Trump on judicial picks, also took issue with Gorsuch's critics when he introduced the justice at the dinner. ""They mischaracterize candor and a demand for rigorous analysis as polarizing,"" Leo said.

Gorsuch and Leo embraced on the podium, in front of an adoring crowd of like-minded lawyers, judges and academics. The Federalist Society, which counted Scalia among its earliest backers, has helped Trump identify candidates for federal judgeships and has members in legal jobs across his administration.

Gorsuch made no apologies either for the substance of his questions and writing, or his style. He talked at length about the importance of seeking out the meaning of the Constitution and laws as they were understood when they written.

""Originalism has regained its place at the table of constitutional interpretation, and textualism in the reading of statutes has triumphed. And neither one is going anywhere on my watch,"" Gorsuch said.

He went on to note that ""some pundits have expressed bewilderment"" about the questions he asks in court.

""But while I have you here tonight, I thought I might just settle the matter once and for all by taking a poll. ... Should I just keep on asking about the text and original meaning of the Constitution?"" he asked.

The response was predictably and overwhelmingly in favor.

ELAINE GANLEY and FRANCES D'EMILIO,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday launched an initiative to combat violence and harassment against women in France, aiming to erase a sense of shame that breeds silence among victims and changing what he said is the country's sexist culture. In a nearly hour-long speech at the Elysee Presidential Palace, Macron noted that 123 women died in attacks against them in France last year. Holding a moment of silence for them, he declared: ""It is time for shame to change camps.""",2017-11-25T19:38:39Z,associated-press,France to tackle violence on women; Italy grapples with same,https://apnews.com/f9433585302f4b2dbcc24635d0099e2d,https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:ab3a70e9aacc47f387e4fc076b332956/2640.jpeg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday launched an initiative to combat violence and harassment against women in France, aiming to erase a sense of shame that breeds silence among victims and changing what he said is the country's sexist culture.

In a nearly hour-long speech at the Elysee Presidential Palace, Macron noted that 123 women died in attacks against them in France last year. Holding a moment of silence for them, he declared: ""It is time for shame to change camps.""

In neighboring Italy, the head of the Chamber of Deputies marked International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women by noting with dismay that the ""Weinstein case"" hasn't inspired women to speak out on workplace harassment or assault like it has in the United States and other parts of Europe.

Laura Boldrini was referring to the onslaught of revelations after sexual harassment and assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were made public.

""The Weinstein case lifted the lid on the shame of (sexual) abuse"" in the glamorous world of U.S. cinema, ""setting off an avalanche in many other areas of society,"" Boldrini said, addressing a special gathering in which all the 630 seats, usually occupied by lawmakers in Parliament's lower house, were instead filled by guests who came to speak of their rebellion against being victims of men.

Among the invited: a woman who survived being stabbed repeatedly in the back by an ex-beau; the mother of a college student who was strangled and her corpse set ablaze by her former lover after she broke up with him; a woman whose child was slain by her estranged husband to avenge their failed marriage; a Moroccan immigrant whose abusive husband burned down their home after she found the courage to flee to safety with their children; a Nigerian who was trafficked into a prostitution ring the day she set foot in Italy.

Boldrini lamented that Italy hasn't seen a similar outpouring of accusations of workplace harassment.

""In Italy, this certainly hasn't had the same effect,"" she said, adding: I'd like to think that this has happened because there aren't molesters, but I'm afraid that's not the way it is.""

She explained the tendency toward silence, including about rape, saying that women ""know that in this country there persists a strong prejudice against them"" in terms of their credibility.

In France, Macron's plan would encourage women to take action, strengthen laws against offenders and educating citizens on the issue — starting from nursery school.

He noted that violence takes on other forms, notably in the workplace, a result of inequality and a false sense of men's superiority.

""What should be sanctuaries today becomes a hunting ground simply because (men) can use ... age, authority, their post, or simply force,"" the French president said.

But Macron cautioned against France becoming a society where every interaction between a man and a woman can come under suspicion. ""We are not a Puritan society,"" he said.

Among proposed measures, Macron said legal complaints will be rushed through the system, and the statute of limitations for suspected sexual crimes against minors would be moved to 30 years from 20 currently as part of a bill to be presented in 2018.

Macron also wants to rectify ""intolerable ambiguities"" in the penal code surrounding the legal age of consent. Outrage followed a ruling in an assault case that an 11-year-old was of the age of consent. He suggested the age of 15 — the legal age of sexual adulthood in France, and the age at which Macron met his future wife, Brigitte, his school's drama teacher.

To encourage more women to speak out, Macron said that from the start of next year, an online alarm system will be set up for instant contact with police.

Nursery school teachers will be trained to address ""non-negotiable"" equality between the sexes.

Macron said violence against women is most often committed where women ""should feel protected"" — be it at home, in the street or in the office — and the ""deafening silence"" must end.

Several of those inspiring other women in Italy to refuse to accept violence at the hands of male companions or relatives, carry their scars of being attacked themselves, like Lucia Annibali, a lawyer whose face was devoured by acid tossed by two attackers hired by her ex-boyfriend, and who now advises the Italian government on legislature measures such as anti-stalking laws.

This rebellion by women marks a stunning turnaround in Italy, where a generation ago, the Italian penal code prescribed lenient prison sentences for men who killed women out of jealousy or to preserve ""family honor.""

EMERY P. DALESIO,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Americans have grown accustomed to hearing apologies from everyone from cheating car-makers to cheating presidents, but a Fortune 500 chemical company with a pollution problem in North Carolina is following a different model: don't apologize, don't explain.

(AP) — Americans have grown accustomed to hearing apologies from everyone from cheating car-makers to cheating presidents, but a Fortune 500 chemical company with a pollution problem in North Carolina is following a different model: don't apologize, don't explain.

For six months, Wilmington, Delaware-based Chemours Co. has faced questions about an unregulated chemical with unknown health risks that flowed from the company's plant into the Cape Fear River, which provides drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people.

The company has said virtually nothing in its own defense about chemicals it may have discharged for nearly four decades, and it skipped legislative hearings looking into health concerns.

Earlier this month, North Carolina environmental regulators said they might fine Chemours, revoke its license to discharge treated wastewater into the nearby river and open a criminal probe. State officials said the company chose silence over reporting a chemical spill last month as required.

In a rare response, Chemours said it's committed to operating the plant, which employs about 900, ""in accordance with all applicable laws and in a manner that respects the environment and public health and safety.""

New tests have detected the chemical GenX, used to make Teflon and other industrial products, at levels beyond the state's estimated but legally unenforceable safety guidepost in 50 private water wells near Chemours' Fayetteville plant and at a water treatment plant in Wilmington, about 100 miles (62 kilometers) downstream. There are no federal health standards addressing GenX and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies it as an ""emerging contaminant"" to be studied.

Lack of information about the chemical, its prevalence and health effects has disturbed people across eastern North Carolina.

John Fisher, 77, said when he moved into his home 20 years ago the company's predecessor, DuPont, would invite neighbors through the gates for picnics and plant tours. But the only contact he's had with Chemours was a notice a couple of weeks ago that his water well needed testing, and its outside vendor arranging to drop off bottled water.

""They haven't officially gotten a hold of us saying, hey, we feel sorry for you, this is what we're going to do for you,"" Fisher said.

Fisher said he wonders whether GenX or other chemicals in his well water caused the cancer deaths of his dog and his daughter's dogs next door.

""They would get big balls hanging off their bellies and they were all cancerous,"" Fisher said. ""We couldn't figure out why all our dogs were dying of cancer.""

DuPont began using GenX to replace another fluorinated compound after neighbors of the company's Parkersburg, West Virginia, plant claimed in more than 3,500 lawsuits that the compound made them sick. DuPont spun off Chemours into a separate company two years ago. A jury in July 2016 found the two companies liable for a man's testicular cancer that he said was linked to a chemical emitted by the West Virginia plant.

The two companies this year agreed to pay nearly $671 million to settle further lawsuits.

Chemours' zipped-lip strategy is likely a defensive crouch against the threat of costly lawsuits at a time when its financial future looks bright, said Geoffrey Basye, a public affairs consultant and former Federal Aviation Administration spokesman under President George W. Bush. Bond rating agency Moody's has upgraded its opinion of the company and Chemours' stock price has more than doubled since the start of the year.

""Not only can a stock's performance play a pivotal role in how a company chooses to respond, or not respond, major shareholders and the board can also influence a company's public affairs posture,"" Basye said.

The company's caution could make people think it's hiding something, he said, but he noted that industrial companies like Chemours tend to have a different culture from enterprises that deal directly with consumers.

""Companies who tend to operate in the shadows before a crisis occurs have a tendency to stay in the shadows once the crisis hits,"" Bayse said.

Chemours' silence runs contrary to legal lessons and social science research that suggest addressing mistakes eases hard feelings and saves corporations money, said Maurice Schweitzer, a Wharton business school professor who teaches negotiation and corporate decision-making.

Studies have found an apology for medical mistakes can be enough to satisfy aggrieved patients, leading to fewer malpractice actions, greater willingness to settle lawsuits and lower demand for damages, Schweitzer said.

""The natural tendency to keep a low profile, hope things blow over, is exactly what anyone who's been harmed by some action doesn't want,"" he said.

That's the awkward question after the departing head of a government agency charged with looking after consumer rights appointed a deputy to temporarily fill his spot. The White House then named its own interim leader.

One job, two people — and two very different views on how to do it.

The first pick is expected to continue the aggressive policing of banks and other lenders that have angered Republicans. The second, President Donald Trump's choice, has called the agency a ""joke,"" an example of bureaucracy run amok, and is expected to dismantle much of what the agency has done.

So come Monday, who will be leading the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?

Senior Trump administration officials said Saturday that the law was on their side and they expect no trouble when Trump's pick for temporary director of the CFPB shows up for work. Departing director Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee long criticized by Congressional Republicans as overzealous, had cited a different rule in saying the law was on his side.

In tendering his resignation Friday, Cordray elevated Leandra English, who was the agency's chief of staff, into the deputy director position. Citing the Dodd-Frank Act that created the CFPB, he said English, an ally of his, would become acting director upon his departure.

Corday's move was widely seen an attempt to stop Trump from shaping the agency in the months ahead.

The White House cites the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. Administration officials on Saturday acknowledged that some other laws appear to clash with Vacancies Act, but said that in this case the president's authority takes precedence.

Who prevails in the legal wrangling is seen as important even though this involves just a temporary posting. Getting a permanent replacement approved by the Senate could take months.

The president's pick for temporary appointee, Mick Mulvaney, had been widely anticipated. Mulvaney, currently director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been an outspoken critic of the agency and is expected to pull back on many of Cordray's actions in the six years since he was appointed.

Trump announced he was picking Mulvaney within a few hours of Cordray's announcement on Friday.

""The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick,"" Trump tweeted Saturday from his private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he is spending a long Thanksgiving weekend. ""Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!""

The administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House's thinking, called Trump's appointment of an acting director a ""routine move."" They said the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has already approved Trump's appointment of Mulvaney and will issue a written legal opinion soon.

The clashing appointments raise the question: What happens when the two new heads show up and try to sit at the same desk and give orders?

One of the administration officials said Mulvaney was expected to start working Monday and that English was expected to also show up — but as deputy director.

The agency has been tangled in in partisan politics since its creation, with the two competing appointees a reflection of that.

English is a trusted lieutenant of Cordray's who has helped investigate and punish financial companies in ways that many Republicans, Mulvaney in particular, think go too far. In his announcement Friday, Cordray highlighted English's ""in-depth"" knowledge of the agency's operations and its staff. Before joining the CFPB, English served at the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management.

""Leandra is a seasoned professional who has spent her career of public service focused on promoting smooth and efficient operations,"" Cordray said in the statement.

Mulvaney was a South Carolina representative to the House before becoming head of the budget office. A founder of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, he was elected in 2010 as part of a tea party wave that brought many critics of the U.S. budget deficit to office. He has taken a hard line on federal spending matters, routinely voting against increasing the government's borrowing cap and pressing for major cuts to benefit programs as the path to balancing the budget.

He also has been unsparing in his criticism of the CFPB. In a widely quoted comment, he once blasted the agency as ""joke,"" saying its lack of oversight by Congress and its far-reaching regulations had gone too far.

""The place is a wonderful example of how a bureaucracy will function if it has no accountability to anybody,"" he told the Credit Union Times in 2014. ""It turns up being a joke in a sick, sad kind of way.""

U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee and a longtime critic of Cordray, said Mulvaney would ""fight not only to protect consumers from force, fraud, and deception but will protect them from government interference with competitive, innovative markets and help preserve their fundamental economic opportunities and liberties.""

Democrats have seized upon Mulvaney's words in criticizing his appointment to the agency.

U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, issued a statement Saturday calling Mulvaney ""unacceptable"" to lead the CFPB because of his ""noxious"" views toward its mission to protect consumers.

""He was also the original co-sponsor of a bill to completely eliminate the Consumer Bureau,"" she wrote, ""and supported other legislation to harmfully roll back Wall Street reform.""","powerful house financial services committee

SUZAN FRASER and JOSH LEDERMAN,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The United States will cut off its supply of arms to Kurdish fighters in Syria, a move by President Donald Trump that is sure to please Turkey but further alienate Syrian Kurds who bore much of the fight against the Islamic State group. In a phone call Friday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump said he'd ""given clear instructions"" that the Kurds will receive no more weapons — ""and that this nonsense should have ended a long time ago,"" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. The White House confirmed the move in a cryptic statement about the phone call that said Trump had informed the Turk of ""pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria.""",2017-11-25T08:01:45Z,associated-press,US cutting off its supply of arms to Kurds fighting in Syria,https://apnews.com/945405f808f04d3a898c0b826bbabcc1,,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The United States will cut off its supply of arms to Kurdish fighters in Syria, a move by President Donald Trump that is sure to please Turkey but further alienate Syrian Kurds who bore much of the fight against the Islamic State group.

In a phone call Friday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump said he'd ""given clear instructions"" that the Kurds will receive no more weapons — ""and that this nonsense should have ended a long time ago,"" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. The White House confirmed the move in a cryptic statement about the phone call that said Trump had informed the Turk of ""pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria.""

The White House called the move ""consistent with our previous policy"" and noted the recent fall of Raqqa, once the Islamic State group's self-declared capital but recently liberated by a largely Kurdish force. The Trump administration announced in May it would start arming the Kurds in anticipation of the fight to retake Raqqa.

""We are progressing into a stabilization phase to ensure that ISIS cannot return,"" the White House said, using an acronym for the extremist group.

The move could help ease strained tensions between the U.S. and Turkey, two NATO allies that have been sharply at odds about how best to wage the fight against IS. Turkey considers the Kurdish Syrian fighters, known by the initials YPG, to be terrorists because of their affiliation to outlawed Kurdish rebels that have waged a three decade-long insurgency in Turkey. Yet the U.S. chose to partner with the YPG in Syria anyway, arguing that the battle-hardened Kurds were the most effective fighting force available.

Cavusoglu, who said he was in the room with Erdogan during Trump's call, quoted the U.S. president as saying he had given instructions to U.S. generals and to national security adviser H.R. McMaster that ""no weapons would be issued.""

""Of course, we were very happy with this,"" Cavusoglu said.

Yet for the Kurds, it was the latest demoralizing blow to their hopes for greater recognition in the region. Last month, the Kurds in neighboring Iraq saw their recent territorial gains erased by the Iraqi military, which seized the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas from the Kurdish regional government in retaliation for a Kurdish independence referendum that the U.S. ardently opposed.

Trump's decision appeared to catch both the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department off guard. Officials at both agencies, who would normally be informed of changes in U.S. policy toward arming the Syrian Kurds, said they were unaware of any changes. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.

It was unclear whether the Trump administration notified the Kurds of the move before telling the Turks. Nor was it how much significance the change would have on the ground, considering the fight against IS is almost over.

The United States has been arming the Kurds in their fight against IS through an umbrella group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which is comprised of Kurdish as well as Arab fighters. But the retreat of IS, which has lost nearly all its territory in Syria, has altered the dynamics in the region and a U.S. defense official said he was unaware of any additional arms scheduled to be transferred to the Kurds, even before the Turkish announcement.

Last week, Col. Ryan Dillon, the chief spokesman for the U.S. coalition that is fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, said there has yet to be any reduction in the number of U.S. advisers working with the SDF. His comments appeared to suggest the possibility that changes in the level and type of U.S. military support for the Syrian Kurds could be coming.

As the fight against IS has waned in recent months, the U.S. has pledged to carefully monitor the weapons it provides the Kurds, notably ensuring that they don't wind up in the hands of Kurdish insurgents in Turkey known as the PKK.

Both Turkey and the U.S. consider the PKK a terrorist group. But the United States has tried to draw a distinction between the PKK and the Syrian Kurds across the border, while Turkey insists they're essentially the same.

In both Syria and Iraq, the U.S. relied on Kurdish fighters to do much of the fighting against IS, but those efforts have yet to lead to a realization of the Kurds' broader aspirations, most notably an independent state.

Washington's support for the Syrian Kurds, in particular, has been a major thorn in U.S.-Turkish relations for several years, given Turkey's concerns about the Kurds' territorial aspirations. In particular, Turkey has feared the establishment of a contiguous, Kurdish-held canton in northern Syria that runs along the Turkish border.

Relations between NATO allies Turkey and the United States have also soured recently over a number of other issues, including Turkey's crackdown on dissent following a failed coup attempt last year. Ankara has also demanded that the U.S. extradite a Pennsylvania-based cleric that it blames for fomenting the coup, but the U.S. says Turkey lacks sufficient proof.

REGINA GARCIA CANO,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Casinos in Las Vegas are upping the ante in their pursuit of coveted millennial visitors with new attractions designed to wow them, provide them Instagram-worthy moments and maybe even get them to gamble a little. In 2018, a zip line across the street from Caesars Palace and an e-sports arena at the Luxor will join the city's entertainment repertoire geared toward those generally up to age 34.

In 2018, a zip line across the street from Caesars Palace and an e-sports arena at the Luxor will join the city's entertainment repertoire geared toward those generally up to age 34. They are becoming majority spenders in today's economy but aren't necessarily interested in traditional casino gambling, such as blackjack and craps.

Fresh out of bankruptcy, Caesars Entertainment plans to build a 1,050-foot-long zip line above its outdoor promenade anchored by the Linq hotel-casino and the world's tallest observation wheel. The attraction — the third of its kind in Sin City, but first on the Las Vegas Strip — will feature 10 lines that will allow thrill seekers to ride seated or Superman-style.

""It's an efficient use of space, but it's exciting,"" Linq Promenade general manager Shaun Swanger said. ""Our core audience is millennials. During the day, you see a lot broader range and a lot more families, but as the sun goes down, it gets a little bit younger, and as midnight approaches, it's one big party.""

The ride will begin at the top of a 114-foot-tall launch tower that Caesars will build at the west end of the promenade. Photos and video of the rides, bound for social media, will be available.

Las Vegas casinos have invested in numerous non-gambling amenities to attract the elusive millennials, from rooms with bunk beds for cost-conscious young travelers to a Wi-Fi-equipped co-working space and a lounge that features pool and air hockey tables.

They also have embraced the outdoors by building a park and public promenades, counter to their long-held strategy of trying to keep people inside casinos, losing track of time as they buy more chips.

It has become increasingly common to bring zip lines — traditionally an outdoor adventure activity — into urban settings, said Andrew Lepp, an associate professor in the recreation, park and tourism management program at Kent State University. In Las Vegas, however, the thrill may last beyond the seconds-long ride.

""You get that adrenaline rush, and then you might be more likely to hit the blackjack table,"" he said. ""Both are forms of calculated risk taking.""

Casino operators for years have been luring young visitors with nightclubs and day clubs that regularly feature world-class DJs, some of whom have long-term contracts once reserved for stars the likes of Celine Dion.

These days, interest in the outdoors is such that Wynn Resorts Ltd. plans to begin the transformation next year of its 18-hole, par-70 golf course into a development that will feature a 38-acre lagoon.

Elsewhere on the Strip, MGM Resorts International is transforming a former nightclub into an arena for competitive gaming. The facility at the Luxor is expected to have a competition stage, LED video wall, daily gaming stations and a streaming and television-quality production studio.

MGM created a committee several years ago dedicated to reimagining the gambling experience with millennials in mind. What will become the second e-sports arena in the gambling oasis can hold 1,000 people at a time. It will have areas for people 21 and older and other spots for a crowd 16 and up.

And for young visitors who want to spend time on the casino floor but find the average slot machine unappealing, operators have adopted skill-based machines. Unlike traditional slots that depend solely on luck, a player's skill can influence whether he or she wins on the new-age machines.

MGM Grand patrons can try a version of the popular Frogger arcade game, while Caesars property Planet Hollywood unveiled new games on its casino floor last month, including versions of the smartphone games ""Catapult King"" and ""Into the Dead.""

The machines hit U.S. casinos for the first time a year ago in New Jersey, but casinos are still tweaking how to market them.","kent state university in las vegas

Bruce Feldman  of Fox Sports reported the contract is a 5-year deal that will pay $4 million per year...",2017-11-25T16:15:45Z,bleacher-report,"Chip Kelly, UCLA Reportedly Agree to 5-Year Contract",http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2684863-chip-kelly-ucla-reportedly-agree-to-contract,https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/650/495/hi-res-8978bef003bb1ce2124ea73d17b9ad75_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images

UCLA announced Saturday it named Chip Kelly its next head coach. The parties agreed to a five-year, $23.3 million contract with a $9 million reciprocal buyout.

Ben Bolch of the Los Angeles Times first reported the news.

""It is an absolute honor to join the Bruin family, and I am grateful to Chancellor [Gene] Block and to [athletics director] Dan Guerrero for this incredible opportunity,"" Kelly said, per the program's announcement. ""UCLA is a world-class institution with a distinguished history in athletics, and we will do our part to uphold its tradition of excellence.""

It's Kelly's third job in as many years after head coaching stints with the Philadelphia Eagles (2013-2015) and San Francisco 49ers (2016). San Francisco fired Kelly after ownership decided to go in a different direction and also fired general manager Trent Baalke.

In four NFL seasons, Kelly was 28-35. While his tenure in Philadelphia began with back-to-back 10-6 seasons, he was fired from that job after the Eagles started 6-9 in 2015. The Niners went 2-14 under Kelly in 2016, though he also took the reins while they were in the early stages of rebuilding.

Nonetheless, Kelly—once considered one of the most progressive minds in football—never had the success in the NFL that he managed during his four seasons with Oregon, with which he went 46-7 and led the Ducks to two Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl and the BCS title game in 2010.

His fast-paced, zone-read offense grew consistently less effective during his time in the NFL as teams adjusted to his style of play.

""We knew what plays were coming, and it's a pretty basic offense,"" Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner said after the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Eagles in December 2014, per Terry Blount of ESPN.com. ""Their offense is kind of predictable. They have a lot of plays where they can only run one way. We were ready for everything they had.""

Kelly's offense also puts pressure on his defense, as the fast pace means the offense doesn't stay on the field for long if it doesn't move the chains—and sometimes even if it does. In turn, the defense can be out there for sustained portions of games and be prone to wearing out.

To Kelly's credit, he made adjustments in San Francisco, often slowing down the pace and trying to fit his scheme to his personnel or using the pistol formation to disguise running plays better. The team's issues seemed to be mediocre talent and poor quarterback play in general rather than Kelly's failings.

At the college level—where the spread offense remains in vogue—Kelly should have more success. He'll have the opportunity to turn the Bruins into a powerhouse and resurrect his reputation.

Kelly's return to the Pac-12 will make UCLA's future matchups against Oregon all the more interesting as well. But he'll also have the task of rebuilding a football program that has long lived in the shadow of its counterpart at USC and the Bruins basketball program.

Jim Mora couldn't accomplish the feat in six seasons from 2012 to 2017, though he did lead the team to consecutive 10-3 marks in 2013-14.

Kelly will institute his high-octane, spread-option attack with UCLA, giving the Bruins a new identity as they look to become a Pac-12 power.","hendersongetty images ucla

Ohio State head football coach Urban Meyer said Saturday that quarterback J.T. Barrett suffered an injury in a collision with a cameraman prior to the Buckeyes' 31-20 win over Michigan.

According to ESPN.com's Dan Murphy, Meyer called for an ""all-out investigation"" to find which cameraman caused the injury.

Barrett left the game after taking a hit in the third quarter and appeared to favor his right leg.

Per Ari Wasserman of The Athletic, Barrett said he didn't believe the incident with the cameraman was intentional:

Barrett also said he believes he will play in next week's Big Ten Championship Game against Wisconsin, according to Dan Hope of Eleven Warriors.

Per Murphy, Meyer said he was unsure if Barrett would be able to play.

Prior to exiting the game, Barrett had completed three of his eight pass attempts for 30 yards and one touchdown. He also rushed for 67 yards and one touchdown on 15 carries.

Freshman Dwayne Haskins filled in and was effective in completing six of seven passes for 94 yards. He added 24 yards on the ground.

Although Barrett returned to the sidelines during the fourth quarter, he did not re-enter the game.

The No. 9 Buckeyes improved to 10-2 with the win by virtue of beating Michigan for the sixth consecutive year.

Barrett is enjoying a huge season with 42 touchdowns accounted for. The Buckeyes will need their senior leader to enhance their chances of winning their first Big Ten title since 2014 and potentially spoiling Wisconsin's College Football Playoff aspirations.","gregory shamusgetty

The Ohio State Buckeyes continued their dominance over the Michigan Wolverines with a 31-20 victory at the Big House on Saturday.

Backup quarterback Dwayne Haskins led the way for Ohio State's win after taking over for an injured J.T. Barrett in the third quarter. The redshirt freshman finished with 118 total yards in his highest-profile appearance to date.

Needing to make a big impression on the College Football Playoff selection committee with two games remaining, the Buckeyes shook off a slow start to beat their archrival for the sixth straight year and 15th time in the past 17 meetings dating back to 2001.

Ohio State entered its regular-season finale ranked No. 9 in the latest playoff standings. After knocking off Michigan, the Buckeyes have won each of their last three games heading into a showdown against Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game on Dec. 2.

Things appeared dire for Ohio State in the third quarter, trailing 20-14, when Barrett went to the locker room after suffering an apparent knee injury on a 10-yard run.

Per Matt Wilhelm of ESPN 850 (via 97.1 The Fan), Barrett has been dealing with an ""ongoing meniscus issue"" in his knee.

Barstool OSU noted the parallels between Barrett's injury against Michigan this year and a scenario that played out against Michigan three years ago:

Haskins attempted 50 passes all season before being thrown into action against Michigan. He fit right in, totaling 55 yards on the drive and setting up J.K. Dobbins' one-yard touchdown run with this perfect pass to Austin Mack on 3rd-and-13:

Ohio State then made the extra point, which Michigan failed to do on its previous touchdown drive, to take a 21-20 lead. The Buckeyes never trailed from then on.

Going back to that 2014 game when Cardale Jones took over for an injured Barrett, Ohio State alum Cris Carter saw similarities between Jones and Haskins after the latter's first touchdown drive:

Playing in front of a raucous home crowd, Michigan looked like the better team in the first quarter. The Wolverines defense had Ohio State on its heels, leading to a historically bad 15 minutes for the Buckeyes in the Urban Meyer era:

Michigan jumped out to a 14-0 lead with two scores in the first 15:03 of game time. Per ESPN Stats & Info, in the past 113 meetings between these two teams, Ohio State had never beaten Michigan when facing a deficit of at least 14 points.

The Cleveland Cam Show noted the start to this game was a perfect summary of how Ohio State has looked so often in 2017:

Ohio State is a team that went from the highs of a 39-38 win over Penn State to a 31-point loss against Iowa in a span of seven days.

Trailing by two touchdowns, Barrett engineered a 75-yard drive that was capped off by his 21-yard touchdown run to help cut the deficit in half. That score put him in one of the most exclusive clubs in FBS history, per Ohio State researcher Jerry Emig:

After Ohio State's defense forced a Michigan punt, Barrett used his arm to tie the score with this 25-yard score to Marcus Baugh:

After an Ohio State field goal made the score 24-20 in the fourth quarter, Michigan appeared to be set up on 2nd-and-1 at the Buckeyes' 36, but the drive stalled after quarterback John O'Korn tripped over an offensive lineman on the snap for a three-yard loss.

O'Korn then overthrew a wide open Chris Evans in the middle of the field on fourth down for a turnover on downs.

O'Korn got the start for Michigan with Brandon Peters unable to pass the concussion protocol, and the fifth-year senior endured his share of criticism for a lackluster performance against Ohio State:

Ohio State left the door open for Michigan by missing a field goal on its ensuing drive, but O'Korn once again overthrew his target, and Jordan Fuller picked him off for the game's only turnover.

In his final home start as a Michigan quarterback, O'Korn went out with a whimper. He finished 17-of-32 for 195 yards with one touchdown and one interception.

Mike Weber put the dagger in the Wolverines' heart with a 25-yard touchdown run three plays after the interception to help give Ohio State a 31-20 advantage with 1:44 left to play.

Just as this game was a microcosm of Ohio State's season, it was a perfect summary of the 2017 Michigan Wolverines. Their defense was impressive early, but the lack of offense eventually left too much of a burden on the defense's shoulders.

Brian J. Manzullo of the Detroit Free Press offered some unflattering stats regarding Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh against top-tier programs:

Harbaugh has proved to be an elite recruiter in his three years at Michigan, but an inability to find and develop a quality quarterback has significantly contributed to those disappointing stats.

While Michigan will await its bowl destiny and answers heading into 2018, Ohio State can turn its attention to Wisconsin and the Big Ten title game, knowing it still has a chance to make the Top Four in the final playoff rankings that will be released on Dec. 3.

Even though Barrett's health will be a focal point for the next seven days, Haskins' performance on this stage gave the Buckeyes confidence to know they won't miss a beat against a fast and physical defense.","urban meyer era michigan

The NBA announced Saturday it fined Charlotte Hornets center Dwight Howard $35,000 for making an obscene gesture on the court during Friday's 100-99 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The incident occurred with 4:25 remaining in the second quarter and the game tied at 46 at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.

According to Spotrac, the fine marked Howard's fifth of the season. The previous four were the result of technical fouls.

The 31-year-old Howard is in the midst of his first season with the Hornets after he spent last season with his hometown Atlanta Hawks.

Howard is enjoying one of his most productive campaigns in years, averaging 15.5 points, 12.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per contest in 18 games.

The eight-time All-Star's statistical output largely fell off after he departed the Orlando Magic in 2012, as he had disappointing runs with the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets.

While he is no longer the MVP candidate he was during the last five of his eight seasons with the Magic, the three-time Defensive Player of the Year has been a key contributor for Charlotte.

Howard led the Hornets with 20 points and 13 rebounds against the Cavs, and he will be back in action Saturday against the visiting San Antonio Spurs.","nell redmondassociated

The University of Nebraska fired head football coach Mike Riley after the Cornhuskers' blowout loss to the Iowa Hawkeyes on Friday meant they finished the regular season with a 4-8 record.

Athletic director Bill Moos released a statement about the decision Saturday:

Bruce Feldman of Sports Illustrated reported linebackers coach Trent Bray is the interim head coach.

Nebraska allowed 42 unanswered points in the second half in the 56-14 defeat. It marked the team's fourth consecutive loss and the sixth in its past seven contests after a 3-2 start to the campaign.

Afterward, Riley told reporters he didn't have ""any indication"" about his job status but he hoped to receive an opportunity to keep rebuilding the Cornhuskers program:

""I'm going to, I'm going to anticipate [being the coach next season], and when I go to bed tonight I'm going to hope for that because I would love to do this. I truly believe I'm exactly the right person to do this. The football parts, I've been doing this so long we know how to fix, and we also are doing a good job recruiting. Those two things are going to be the key to Nebraska getting back to where everybody wants to go. The football has to grow, and the recruiting has to continue to be high level to get really back there.""

Riley received a one-year contract extension in September to take his deal through 2020. His $2.9 million in total pay for the 2017 season ranked 41st among college head coaches, per USA Today.

In all, the 64-year-old Idaho native compiled a 19-19 record across three years at Nebraska. He had a 93-80 mark during a prior 14-year run at Oregon State.

Feldman listed Scott Frost (UCF), Dan Mullen (Mississippi State), Kevin Sumlin (Texas A&M), Bret Bielema (Arkansas) and Mike Leach (Washington State) among the potential options to replace Riley.","scott frost ucf dan mullen

LaVar Ball said he's going to send United States President Donald Trump a pair of Big Baller Brand ZO2s, the signature shoe of Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball, ""so he can calm down a little bit"" after they feuded about the release of LiAngelo Ball from China last week.

On Saturday, TMZ Sports passed along comments from the elder Ball, who joked Trump will ""ease up"" after he puts on the new shoes:

Trump has sent out a series of messages on social media directed toward Ball for not thanking him after the president claimed he was the reason LiAngelo, as well as UCLA teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, were allowed to leave China after being arrested on shoplifting charges:

Ball said during an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo he wasn't sure why Trump was so focused on receiving a thank you.

""If you help, you shouldn't have to say anything,"" he said. ""Let him do his political affairs and let me handle my son and let's just stay in our lane.""

Meanwhile, the Apex Marketing Group estimated the exchanges between Trump and Ball generated $13.2 million in free advertising for the latter's Big Baller Brand, per Darren Rovell of ESPN.

""I must be good,"" Ball responded when asked about that figure by TMZ Sports.

The ZO2 Prime Remix shoes the outspoken patriarch said he'll send to Trump carry a retail value of $495.","allen berezovskygetty

Chains simplified promotions this year and took a keener eye to managing their inventory. At Wal-Mart Stores Inc., color-coded maps helped shoppers navigate the aisles. Retailers also made headway with their e-commerce sites, aiming to chip away at Amazon.com Inc.’s dominance online.

Taken together, the changes may help bolster sales and profit margins -- despite a decline in customer traffic at many locations.

“People think retail is a nightmare, but it’s not,” said Tracy Ferschweiler, a Wal-Mart market manager who oversees seven stores around New York and New Jersey.

The weather also provided an assist, with cooler temperatures in much of the country putting shoppers in the mood for coats and sweaters. But the day wasn’t without its glitches. Macy’s Inc., the largest U.S. department-store chain, struggled to process credit-card transactions. That led to long lines and frustrated customers.

Many retailers are counting on the holidays to help fuel their turnaround plans, and Black Friday is the season’s traditional starting point. Still, the event has lost significance over the years -- especially as chains spread out their promotions to attract shoppers earlier in November.

In the past, Black Friday was famous for crowds bursting through doors and fighting over $99 DVD players. There’s less urgency among shoppers now, but retailers have many advantages this year, including strong consumer confidence and low unemployment.

The day has become more about the experience of shopping, rather than the actual discounts, said David Bassuk, co-head of retail consulting at AlixPartners LLP.

“People want to start getting into the holiday spirit and enjoy the concept of shopping and the holidays,” he said.

At a Target Corp. store in Kingston, New York, 55-year-old Donna McCluskey said she got up early to shop Black Friday deals as part of a family tradition.

“We do this every year -- we came here for fun,” said McCluskey, who arrived at Target with her two adult sons. “We do a lot of shopping online, but it’s a different experience shopping in stores. You can feel and touch and look at the products.”

E-Commerce Growth

E-commerce continues to outpace brick-and-mortar retail in sales growth, making it crucial for traditional stores to have enticing websites and apps.

Black Friday online spending was a record $5.03 billion, up 16.9 percent over last year, according to Adobe Systems Inc. Much of that shopping is now occurring on phones, with mobile devices accounting for 54 percent of visits. Adobe said it expects Cyber Monday to be the biggest online shopping day in history, with $6.6 billion in predicted sales, a 16.5 percent increase over 2016.

Such optimism helped push the fortune of Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, to $100.3 billion as the online retailer’s shares jumped more than 2 percent Friday.

Physical-store traffic, meanwhile, was down 4 percent to 6 percent, Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen estimates.

Retailers have tried to avoid becoming showrooms for Amazon, meaning customers look at products in their stores and then buy it from the e-commerce giant. To keep shoppers from straying, Wal-Mart and others have pumped billions into their web operations.

Sights and Sounds

Macy’s overhauled its rewards program, aiming to keep consumers loyal regardless of whether they’re online or off. A customer who shells out at least $500 a year gets free shipping and 25 percent off a day of shopping.

But the 159-year-old chain also is touting its traditional retail experience as a way to hook shoppers.

“Customers today want to go to a store -- the sights, the smells, the sounds,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in an interview Friday.

Some retailers have more of an uphill battle. Sears Holdings Corp. saw same-store sales fall 17 percent at its flagship chain last quarter and 13 percent at its Kmart brand.

At a Sears in upstate New York, a quiet store greeted 47-year-old Nadine Charles on Friday. She’s been a regular Sears customer for years, but feels like the selection has gone downhill.

“I don’t find anything good anymore at Sears,” said Charles, a nurse with four children. “They don’t have good brands. Now I can buy things in Wal-Mart -- they are cheaper and last longer.”

Tom Metcalf,Jeff Bezos is the world’s newest $100 billion mogul.,2017-11-24T18:05:09Z,bloomberg,Jeff Bezos’s Net Worth Just Broke $100 Billion,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/jeff-bezos-fortune-hits-100-billion-on-black-friday-stock-surge,https://assets.bwbx.io/s3/javelin/public/javelin/images/social-tech-7d25a852b6.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Jeff Bezos is the world’s newest $100 billion mogul.

The Amazon.com Inc. founder’s fortune is up $2.4 billion to $100.3 billion, as the online retailer’s shares jumped more than 2 percent on optimism for Black Friday sales. Online purchases for the day are up 18.4 percent over last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics, and investors are betting the company will take an outsized share of online spending over the gifting season.

The $100 billion milestone makes Bezos, 53, the first billionaire to build a 12-figure net worth since 1999, when Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates hit the mark.

Bezos’s fortune rose $32.6 billion this year through Thursday, the largest increase of anyone on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the world’s 500 richest people. Amazon have climbed 5 percent this week alone.

As Bezos’s wealth flirts with new heights, there’s likely to be more questions about what he intends to do with it. Unlike Gates, who was the world’s richest person until Bezos passed him in October, or U.S. investor Warren Buffett, the world’s third-richest person with $78.9 billion, Bezos has given relatively little of his fortune to charity.

Bezos is only just starting to focus on philanthropy, and in June tweeted a request for ideas on how to help people. Since 2002, Bezos has given away Amazon shares worth about $500 million at current prices, according to a Bloomberg analysis of Form 4 filings. The billionaire said in April that he sells $1 billion of Amazon stock every year to fund his space business Blue Origin LLC.

Gates, 62, who has a net worth of $86.8 billion according to the Bloomberg index, would be worth more than $150 billion if he hadn’t given away almost 700 million Microsoft Corp. shares and $2.9 billion of cash and other assets to charity, according to an analysis of his publicly disclosed giving since 1996. The index numbers are based on the close of trading in New York Wednesday. Bezos’s fortune and Amazon share data reflect Friday’s closing trading prices in New York.

Elizabeth Dexheimer,"President Donald Trump said he is naming White House budget director Mick Mulvaney to be the temporary head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, setting up what could be a high-stakes clash over the regulator’s leadership.",2017-11-25T00:54:40Z,bloomberg,Trump Sets Up Clash Over CFPB Leadership by Installing Mulvaney,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-25/trump-sets-up-clash-over-cfpb-leadership-by-installing-mulvaney,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ih0rthe8Vn5c/v1/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"A high-stakes legal clash is unfolding over President Donald Trump’s temporary pick to run Elizabeth Warren’s favorite bank regulator, and the White House is holding its ground.

Trump on Friday said he’s naming White House budget director Mick Mulvaney to be the temporary head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The announcement came hours after outgoing CFPB Director Richard Cordray said he was tapping a deputy to run the agency on an acting basis, a move widely seen as an attempt to prevent the White House from naming a successor.

The CFPB “has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administration’s pick,” the president said on Twitter late Saturday. “Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!”

With two officials having been appointed to the same post, it’s unclear who’ll be in charge of the consumer regulator’s more than 1,000 employees when they come to work on Monday. It’s possible the dispute will play out in the courts for months until a permanent successor is named and confirmed by the Senate.

Replacement Soon

A senior White House official said on Saturday that Trump is expected to decide on a permanent replacement for Cordray in the coming weeks.

Republicans are eager to start remaking the six-year-old agency, which they blame for burdening banks with unnecessary rules and have criticized as being unaccountable. Cordray and other Democrats are desperate to keep it out of the administration’s grip as long as they can.

Cordray, 58, appointed by former President Barack Obama, officially stepped down on Friday. As he exited, the former Ohio attorney general announced that his chief of staff, Leandra English, would become deputy director and thus automatically rise to serve as acting director when he left.

But there’s a legal debate over how much power Cordray has to name his replacement. The White House indicated that Trump believes he has the authority to name the agency’s interim leader using a federal vacancies law. The administration consulted with the Office of Legal Counsel, a unit of the Justice Department, before making the decision, White House officials said.

‘Empower Consumers’

“The President looks forward to seeing Director Mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the CFPB’s dedicated staff, an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,” the White House said in a statement. “Director Mulvaney will serve as Acting Director until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed.”

As director, Mulvaney, 50, is expected to bring sweeping changes to an agency he’s called “the very worst kind of government entity.” Mulvaney will continue to serve as director of the Official of Management and Budget while also filling in at the CFPB starting on Monday, senior White House officials said. The officials deferred to Mulvaney questions on how he’d manage his time between the two jobs.

Succession of the CFPB director is disputed by legal experts and is the latest source of partisan bickering over the agency’s power and structure. The Dodd-Frank Act states that the deputy director is in charge “in the absence or unavailability” of the director.

To read more about the CFPB, click here.

Democrats including Cordray and Senator Warren of Massachusetts, who’s credited with having helped create the CFPB, believe that means English -- a senior adviser to the OMB during the Obama administration -- is now in charge. On the other hand, a federal vacancies law allows the president to name a temporary head of an agency when the director resigns. The White House believes the Vacancies Act takes precedence.

Cordray announced on Nov. 15 that he planned to resign, amid speculation that he’ll run for governor of Ohio as a Democrat. The role of deputy director had been vacant for months before Cordray named English, a move that banking industry lobbyists says creates uncertainty in the marketplace and illustrates the flaws of having just one person in charge of the bureau.

“This is absurd that we may have a pay-per-view event when Mulvaney walks in on Monday,” Consumer Bankers Association President Richard Hunt said in an interview. “It was a little arrogant that Cordray believes he could pick his own successor.”

Partisan Bickering

The CFPB was established in the wake of the global financial crisis to police credit cards, auto loans, and other consumer finance products. Since its inception the agency has often been at the center of bitter partisan bickering. Democrats, led by Warren -- a special adviser to the CFPB before its launch -- have praised the agency for returning billions of dollars to harmed consumers. Republicans call it a “rogue” entity with a leader that wields too much unchecked power.

Warren backed Cordray’s move to appoint his deputy. She wrote on Twitter late Friday that “the Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. Donald Trump can’t override that.”

“Donald Trump can nominate the next CFPB Director -- but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act,” Warren wrote.

The crude producer will price the IPO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. for Distribution PJSC in a range of 2.35 dirhams (64 U.S. cents) to 2.95 dirhams a share, said the people, who asked not to be named as the matter is private. Based on that estimate, the unit is valued at $8 billion to $10 billion. Adnoc plans to announce the IPO price range on Sunday.

Adnoc wasn’t immediately available for comment.

The final amount of shares sold and proceeds raised will depend on investor demand, the people said. Adnoc would raise as much as $2 billion if it sells 20 percent of the company at the top end of the range, they said. The final amount could be more in the $1 billion-to-$1.5 billion range, one of the people said.

The company said last week it plans to offer 1.25 billion to 2.5 billion shares in the sale, with the stock expected to begin trading on Dec. 13.

Adnoc posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 2.1 billion dirhams last year. The offering is among several expected in the Middle East, including that of Saudi Aramco, as oil-rich Gulf governments sell assets to raise cash to diversify their economies after crude prices slumped.

Offering Struggles

Earlier this month, Emaar Development PJSC struggled to complete its $1.31 billion offering as a crackdown on corruption in Saudi Arabia hurt market sentiment and led investors to pull orders, people familiar with deal said. Shares fell 4.3 percent on the first day of trading, the worst debut since 2014 among the 10 biggest IPOs in the Middle East and Africa over that time span, Bloomberg data show.

Adnoc will try to sell stakes in some units and seek partners for others, Chief Executive Officer Sultan Al Jaber said in an interview this month. The company, which raised $3 billion in bonds last month, is putting chunks of separate operating units up for sale instead of selling a piece of the parent company. Adnoc, which pumps most of the crude in the U.A.E., allows foreign firms to join in partnerships that give them a stake in the emirate’s oil.

Kim Bhasin,New York’s glitzy department stores such as Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman threat the shopping holiday a little differently.,2017-11-25T13:57:12Z,bloomberg,How America’s Swankiest Stores Do Black Friday,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-25/how-america-s-swankiest-stores-do-black-friday,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iDs8F6h1jk.U/v1/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"At the entrance of Bergdorf Goodman, one of the world’s glitziest department stores, the morning after Thanksgiving, a store associate puts a few Saint Laurent handbags on top a glass case. He pauses and looks at the dozen or so people gathered. “Up to 40 percent off,” he announces to the early birds. They gasp and start analyzing the red satchels and tan suede totes–then put them back down, and move on.

America’s fanciest shops do Black Friday in a different fashion than their mid- or mass-market counterparts. Lines are short and no doors get busted, but there are still sales to enjoy and deals to find. The finest department stores welcome shoppers with rare markdowns, though they’re still quite modest. It’s hard to find anything treated like a true holiday doorbuster–instead, just 25 percent in one corner, an extra 10 percent off in the next.

Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue is one of the world’s premier shopping streets, featuring both high-end swag and affordable clothing shops. It’s 9 a.m. and Bergdorf has just opened its doors. By then, the sidewalks are already bustling with people carrying bags from the more modest end of the retail spectrum–Hollister, Aldo, Uniqlo. Fancy shops don’t open before sunrise. They certainly don’t open on Thanksgiving proper, as many discount-crazed stores have done since 2011. Macy’s welcomed customers at 5 p.m. Thursday, stayed open until 2 a.m., then re-opened four hours later. J.C. Penney went even further, with a 2 p.m. opening on Thanksgiving Day. That’s early enough to skip the family chatter and get all your shopping done before dinner.

Rare Markdowns

Bergdorf Goodman’s 5th floor is its busiest area on Black Friday, with markdowns on its contemporary brands–labels such as Alice + Olivia, Halston Heritage, and Diane Von Furstenburg. On its main accessories floor, there’s the handful of Saint Laurent items and some small leather goods from Balenciaga. Nearly everything in the store cost hundreds, or thousands, or dollars, so even the sale items go slowly throughout the day.

At the Saks Fifth Avenue famed flagship a few blocks away, people stop on the sidewalk to take photos of the Snow White-themed holiday windows, as “Whistle While You Work” blasts from speakers strapped to ledges on the second floor. In the store, there are many more 40 percent off clothing racks than usual, full of Alexander McQueen denim jackets, Carolina Herrera dresses, and long graphic T-shirts from Givenchy. The only Black Friday hysteria at Saks happened when water started leaking from the ceiling on the 7th floor, sending employees scrambling to drag racks of Hugo Boss clothing away from the cascade.

Barneys New York, a few blocks north, opens at 10 a.m., later than most of its high-end competitors, and touts 40 percent off “select merchandise.” Some sections of the store are outfitted with black-and-white signs that simply say “sale,” which act as magnets for all who pass by. It’s a similar vibe to that of Bergdorf. Shoppers are either paired up–spouses or BFFs–or they come in packs. Packs of trendy twentysomethings roam the men’s store, poking around for the latest street-style from such labels as Off White and Acne Studios.

An Overwhelming Tide

Bloomingdale’s is much livelier, thanks to a six-hour sale to open Black Friday. All kinds of merchandise is flagged with red discount signs. Its sale was popular enough, in fact, to wreak havoc on its credit card processing system. Parent Macy’s Inc. experienced billing issues with both Bloomingdale’s and its namesake department store chain, leaving shoppers frustrated and unable to make their purchases. Some were told to come back later, perhaps with cash, in order to buy the items they wanted. Brown paper bags filled up with items on hold piled up behind cash register counters.

All these stores offer their personalized services on Black Friday. Barneys, for instance, has concierge services to get tickets to concerts or the theater. For those unwilling to spend hours combing through dresses and blouses, personal shoppers are available on most floors. The lower level houses the beauty area, with brow and makeup services, and a hair salon if you want a fresh blowout for the big shopping day.

Quick visits to specialty stores show that it’s business as usual, despite the shopping frenzy elsewhere. Louis Vuitton opened its flagship a bit earlier in the morning, but there are no sales. Chanel and Dior will keep their boutiques open for an extra hour at the end of the day. For Saint Laurent, Burberry, and Fendi, all is normal. Want the real deals? You have to go downmarket. The windows at Coach’s store nearby are plastered with “Up to 50% Off” decals.

A Busy Avenue

Late in the morning, a few hours into the shopping day, 5th Ave. is now fully populated. They’re mostly tourists; New Yorkers are either at work, or they’ve left the city for Thanksgiving. Some get distracted by the black-and-gold facade of Trump Tower, and scuttle across the street to take selfies behind police barricades and in front of NYPD and Secret Service officers carrying rifles.

Back at Bergdorf across the street, most of those Saint Laurent bags remain on the glass case. Shoppers tend to think about their purchases for a while when they’re considering shelling out $2,000 for a handbag. Nearby, a pair of women sidle up to the Loro Piana section, browsing the selection of luxury cashmere and wool. The sales associate perks up.

“Do you want to try it on?” she asks.

“Is this on a discount?” one of the women says, holding a black wool coat in the air.

“No,” the associate responds curtly, then gestures toward all the Loro Piana merchandise behind her. “Nothing here is on discount.”","blackandgold facade of trump

Puigdemont, who maintains he’s the legitimate regional president after being sacked by the central government, will lead a new platform under the banner of Together for Catalonia. He said on Saturday a victory at the polls on Dec. 21 would serve to ratify his mandate and send a signal to the European Union, which has repeatedly sided with the government of Mariano Rajoy against unilateral attempts for independence.

“The people of Catalonia have shown the world we have the capacity and the will to become an independent state,” Puigdemont told an audience in Bruges, Belgium, where he’s been staying since declaring independence last month. “On Dec. 21, we must ratify that.”

The independence movement is trying to reshape its message after the Rajoy administration invoked unprecedented constitutional powers to oust the regional government and take direct control of the wealthy region. The Madrid government acted after the ill-fated independence declaration that led thousands of local companies move their registered address.

Puigdemont remains in Belgium awaiting a court decision to execute a European arrest order from a Spanish judge on charges of rebellion that could see him jailed for as long as 30 years. He blamed authorities in Madrid for limiting his ability to campaign. Rajoy’s administration has accused him of fleeing the nation to escape legal responsibilities.

Catalonia Deputy President Oriol Junqueras and half the ousted regional cabinet remain in prison, pending trial on the same charges unless a judge opts to release them. The question remains whether they’ll be able to campaign if the Supreme Court, which is handling the case, finds sufficient grounds to order their release while the investigation continues.

Polls so far show a split Catalan parliament with no obvious majorities. Pro-independence ERC party is predicted to win, replacing Puigdemont’s PDeCAT as the leading separatist force, while pro-union Ciutadans and the Catalan Socialists also would add seats.

A loss of seats by the separatist parties in the regional vote will be seen as failure of their strategies while viewed as positive by investors, Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said Saturday.

“In the short term, we would see a reaction in the equity markets and in risk premiums,” Guindos said in the Catalan town of S’Agaro.","carles puigdemont

Jackson was at Blue Lemon, a fast-casual restaurant in Sandy, Utah, outside Salt Lake City, eating dinner with his family. He stepped outside and dialed.

Lee needed help, fast: FEMA was running low on food rations. In the previous four weeks, the agency had supplied millions of meals to the Texans and South Floridians displaced by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Maria had created a third disaster zone with more complex logistics, having knocked out Puerto Rico’s electricity, gutted its roads, and destroyed its markets and ports. Restoring food security on the island could take months. Lee had to procure millions of servings of just-add-water meals to sustain the victims. Could Jackson provide at least 2 million and begin deliveries immediately?

Featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, Nov. 27, 2017. Subscribe now Photographer: Caroline Tompkins for Bloomberg Businessweek

Jackson is the 42-year-old chief executive officer of Wise Co., a leading brand in survival foods, that is, Mylar pouches of freeze-dried meals such as Savory Stroganoff and Loaded Baked Potato Casserole designed to remain edible on shelves for a quarter century. Over the past several years, the prepper phenomenon—people geared for imminent disaster—has come out of the backwoods via shows like the National Geographic Channel’s Doomsday Prepper and media reports of the very rich and very worried buying and fortifying luxury bunkers. Jackson’s been positioning Wise to feed the trend. During the call, he felt a rush of conflicting emotions—not so much from the prospect of getting a fat government contract while legions of people suffer, but because the windfall could derail his business strategy. A 2-million-serving order will increase his sales for 2017 about 15 percent but stretch his supply more than he’s comfortable with; his answer to Lee was not an easy yes.

Jackson has filled many emergency orders, including supplies for Ebola victims in Liberia and for people in the Philippines devastated by 2013’s earthquake. Carnival Cruise Line has stocked Wise pouches at its Caribbean ports to feed employees when storms rock the region. Just a few days before the FEMA call, the Salvation Army purchased 100,000 servings of Wise products for Florida shelters near areas affected by Hurricane Irma.

But these last-minute orders aren’t how Jackson wants to define his core business. Since 2013, when he came on as CEO, he’s been trying to move the company beyond the volatile disaster-response industry. “I’m not going to turn down an incredible opportunity,” he says, “but I’m also not after sporadic clients. I want predictability. I want Mr. and Mrs. Smith in Everytown U.S.A. The Walmarts, the Home Depots—those are my golden geese. If a big order from FEMA interrupts our supply to staple customers, that’s a risk I shouldn’t take.”

For someone working in an industry defined by worst-case-scenario extremism, Jackson is notably moderate in appearance and philosophy. Tall, tidy, and well-coiffed, he looks like Clark Kent—but a Kent who’d be content never to don his cape and is facing middle-age metabolic slowdown. When I meet him at Wise’s headquarters in Salt Lake City, he’s wearing a quilted jacket, pressed khakis, and polished shoes that match his belt. He drives a BMW 5 Series sedan and looks like a man who’s comfortable on a golf course, which he is, having played competitively in his youth.

Jackson’s lived in Utah since high school, when his family moved there from a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from the University of Utah, he spent the first 15 years of his career selling chicken nuggets and Honey Bunches of Oats, among other kitchen-table icons, first at Tyson Foods Inc., where he specialized in frozen cutlet products, and then at Post Consumer Brands cereals, where he became a vice president for sales and marketing. Now he’s relying on his corporate experience to suburbanize survivalism—a goal that seems at once respectable, preposterous, and, suddenly, attainable.

Jackson first connected with Wise in 2012, when a headhunter tried to recruit him from Post to run the fast-growing startup. He declined the offer, but commenced some research. “My aha! came in mid-2012 when I read that more than half of American homes have first-aid kits on hand, along with fire extinguishers and flashlights. I realized then they haven’t added the food component. I saw incredible growth potential.” When the headhunter extended the offer again a few months later, Jackson accepted the job of CEO and cautiously started to shift the marketing focus to his ideal customer, one who looks less like Ted Kaczynski and more like himself, his wife, who’s an attorney, and their two tweens: someone who isn’t entirely convinced that humanity is hurtling toward annihilation but who’s willing to stock the pantry with a Mylar-fortified food supply just in case. “This is the food equivalent of life insurance—staples that every American household in this age of uncertainty should have,” he says.

Jackson hired a young designer who’d been at the surf company Quiksilver to revamp the packaging. “We’d been selling our products in large, black plastic tubs. We needed something that doesn’t scream doomsday, so we moved to clean white boxes, contemporary fonts, high-quality food images—packaging that makes sense on a Target shelf,” Jackson says. As orders came in from big-box stores, he added a manufacturing facility a 15-minute drive from the office (production had previously been outsourced) that can produce 25 million pouches a year.

In the past four months, the spate of natural disasters combined with the specter of nuclear war with North Korea has pushed up Wise’s total sales 40 percent from the previous four-month period. Concerned suburbanites as well as disaster responders have contributed to the increase. The factory has made it possible for Jackson to meet both sudden surges and steady growth in demand. He ultimately managed to ship the 2 million servings to FEMA in a matter of weeks, with only a brief disruption to his regular customers’ supply.

In four years, Wise’s annual retail sales have more than doubled, to about $75 million. Using his network of former clients, Jackson persuaded Wal-Mart Stores, Target, Home Depot, and Bed Bath & Beyond to carry Wise products. In 2014 he also persuaded Home Shopping Network to feature the company’s wares; the TV network has become its biggest distributor. But at this point, only 2 percent of Americans have bought into survival foods, according to industry analysis. Wise’s two main competitors, Emergency Essentials LLC and Mountain House are, like all companies in the industry, privately held and don’t report sales data, but Jackson estimates that survival food sales total about $400 million annually. Jackson sees the survival food industry today where the organics industry was in the 1950s before Americans got nervous about pesticides—poised to explode. Still, Darren Seifer, a food and beverage analyst at NPD Group, cautions the industry could just as easily “remain on the fringe, gathering dust on pantry shelves.”

The pot-pie room at Wise’s factory in downtown Salt Lake City is a large space with white walls and cement floors, filled with stainless-steel equipment. Machines hum and chuff as conveyors move materials between them. A funnel the size of a back-alley dumpster dominates the room, drawing the eye like an industrial interpretation of Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain. Inside it is a grayish blend of freeze-dried potato chunks, carrot pieces, celery and onion slivers, peas, and whey protein.

When no one’s looking, I dig my gloved hands into the pallid, pebbly stuff, sifting through it like a pile of shells at the beach. It’s oddly weightless—hundreds of gallons of vegetables with the heft of confetti. The mixture slowly flows down from the funnel base through a chute to another device that weighs and divides it. The portions then travel to a machine emitting clouds of beige powder as it dispenses shots of dehydrated milk, celery salt, powdered garlic, and chicken bouillon. The seasoned kibble is then deposited and sealed, one 7-ounce portion every few seconds, inside Mylar bags along with pods of oxygen-absorbing sachets of iron filings, clay, and salt. The bags are labeled, “chicken flavored pot pie.”

This is the first stop on my tour with Jackson through half a dozen rooms. We also visit the “hearty tortilla soup” and “maple pancake breakfast” rooms, where thousands more gold and silver Mylar pouches roll off conveyors into bins. In each room, technicians in white lab coats bring to mind Oompa Loompas as they pull levers, toggle switches, and examine packages for flaws. At one point, to demonstrate a bag’s airtightness, a stocky technician in boots puts a pouch on the floor and jumps on it.

The scene evokes Willy Wonka’s factory in part because the workers are achieving Wonkian ends. As a kid, I spent hours imagining the sensations of Roald Dahl’s three-course chewing gum invention “made of tomato soup, roast beef and baked potato, and blueberry pie.” This, too, is an attempt to create an all-in-one meal that bears little resemblance to the foods it conjures—a product that when combined with a serving of hot water simulates a home-cooked dinner.

Wiping a film of beige powder from his safety glasses, Jackson displays his range of products, from a small, 72-hour “survival kit” for $19.99, to a one-year supply for a family of four that goes for $7,999. Each serving is about 300 calories and costs less than $1—a per-calorie cost on par with prices at a McDonald’s.

Jackson’s technology isn’t new. Wise practices a 21st century version of something the Incas started in roughly 1200 A.D., when they placed meat strips on high-altitude stone platforms to freeze overnight and then dry in the sun to make charqui, a proto-beef jerky. Modern freeze-drying methods were created during World War II to preserve blood serum so it could be shipped internationally to treat the wounded. The current processes arose in the late 1970s when concerns over the oil crisis and stagflation motivated millions of Americans to cache food.

Wise has tweaked this decades-old formula only a little: Fresh ingredients are rapidly blast-frozen at temperatures as low as –112F to prevent the formation of ice crystals that could affect food texture and nutrition. The food is then placed in a heated vacuum chamber that causes the ice to sublimate, changing directly from a solid to a gas without passing through a liquid phase. When the foods are rehydrated, pores left from the vanished ice quickly reabsorb water. The process takes almost double the energy used for canning, but can retain more than 90 percent of the food’s nutrients and preserve it for far longer. The higher the fat content of a food, the faster it spoils. In pursuit of rich taste and longevity, Jackson has worked with food scientists to develop ingredient combinations and airtight, light-resistant packaging that extends storage times for most Wise meals to 25 years, from 7 to 15 years. Wise also sells water storage and filtration kits for rehydration in the event a household’s water supply is cut off.

I first heard about Wise a few years ago from a cousin, a former police officer in Zionsville, Ind., who kept a supply of its products in his basement that could sustain his family for six months. Then my stepbrother, an executive who lives in downtown Washington, invested in a stash of drinking water and long-storage food. And my brother, a climate scientist with the Nature Conservancy, began building a supply in the basement of his West Virginia cabin. “I can’t imagine anything worse than not being able to feed my kids,” he says, “and the chances of disruptions in our food supply are by all accounts becoming more likely.”

To me, this smacked of paranoia. My brother, cousin, and stepbrother represent a skewed sample: All are guys, all own guns, and two like to hunt in their free time with compound bows and arrows. Each possesses at least a flicker of the fatalist prepper sensibility that Wise was built in 2006 to serve. Like most survival food companies, including Emergency Essentials, Wise was founded in Utah and began marketing its products to the Mormon community preparing for the end of times, a practice encouraged by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (Jackson isn’t Mormon.) But Mormons—and for that matter, male preppers—no longer represent the entirety, or even the majority, of Wise’s exploding market. “Five years ago, our market was more than 95 percent men. Today, we’re reaching about 50 percent women,” Jackson says, “many of them moms—‘guardian moms,’ we call them—worried about a stable food supply for their kids.”

The company’s first customers a decade ago were anxious about inflation, economic collapse, and terrorist attacks; today, the major concern is environmental instability. “It’s not just the freak events. We get calls from people saying, ‘I live in Miami, and flooding is now routine. I’m worried Florida is going to be under water in two years,’ ” he says. “Or from people in upstate New York who experienced a 1-in-a-1,000-year blizzard and couldn’t get out of their driveway for two weeks. People who lived through the California drought, the forest fires of Texas and the Northwest, and who think maybe the government won’t come to their rescue when a disaster hits.”

“This isn’t about the zombie apocalypse anymore—natural disasters are the new normal”

When he started at Wise, Jackson’s biggest concern was a lack of repeat customers: Most people, presumably, won’t use up their disaster stores. The surprise has been how many of his customers return. “Up to 40 percent of my monthly sales volume is from repeat consumers,” he says. Some buy the products for friends and family as gifts. He pumps up his marketing campaigns around Black Friday and, in the last two years, average monthly sales for November and December have been 20 percent higher than average monthly sales for the rest of the year. And more customers are defining their “emergency” uses of the food in new ways. “If you’re a mother or father of a couple kids and you’re trying to put together a meal before soccer practice—that’s an emergency in its own right. They’re running short on time, low on groceries, so they grab a pouch of lasagna, add water, and have a rib-sticking dinner for four in minutes.”

In Miami, some colleges have to stay prepared for food disruptions because trucks are pulled off the road and students are required to stay in their dorms when winds get above 39 miles an hour. Michael Ross, resident district manager of the University of Miami’s dining services, has purchased 64,000 servings of Wise products in the past three years to feed dorm-bound students. His team found Wise in 2013 at a disaster-preparedness trade show and chose the brand after taste testing it against others. Ross used to stock up on less shelf-stable fare when storms were predicted, but if the storms turned, much of the inventory would go to waste. “This we can pull out and dust off whenever we need it,” he says. “The students are amazed. Many have said it’s better than the food they make for themselves and ask to take it home.”

Recognizing the blurring of convenience and emergency, Jackson offers his same product in camping pouches and sells a line of freeze-dried snacks. This accounts for about 5 percent of Wise’s products, which represent a roughly $60 million category, he says. Drafting on the post-food trend, Wise also created a nutrient-fortified protein shake. Silicon Valley’s Soylent raised $25 million last year to extend the reach of its product, a just-add-water vegan powder—baby formula for adults—which has been imitated by Custom Body Fuel, People Chow, Ample Foods, and a half-dozen other new meal-replacement brands that claim to be nutritionally complete and save consumers time and money while reducing their carbon footprint. But the majority of Wise’s sales remain the $129.99 black square tubs (the new packaging is catching up with old inventory) containing an advertised 13,600 calories to keep a family of four fed for a week. If you’re the sole survivor, it’ll last four.

At the end of my visit to Salt Lake City, I whip up a batch of rehydrated pot pie. The result is a tawny gruel. I hesitate, stifle a gag reflex, channel my inner Violet Beauregarde, and swallow. The stuff tastes quite pleasantly of the chicken casserole that was a staple of my childhood. But when I try to imagine consuming the contents of the Mylar pouch in the aftermath of a hurricane, or in a world torn by battles over dwindling, climate change-threatened food supplies, it’s too easy. I lose my enthusiasm.

Am I succumbing to my brother’s paranoia or beginning to think pragmatically? I wonder. Wildfires and hurricanes aren’t the only reasons behind the spread of the survivalist mindset. According to a United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, warming temperatures will reduce global agriculture yields more than 2 percent every decade, given current trends, as the world’s population surges to 9 billion. Food prices could almost double by 2050. If they do, regional and international conflicts over limited affordable food would likely escalate—further increasing the odds against food security.

“This isn’t about the zombie apocalypse anymore—natural disasters are the new normal,” says Daisy Luther, the blogger behind the website the Organic Prepper and a survivalist in the more typical vein. She thinks we should all follow the adage, “eat what you store, store what you eat,” and has guns to protect her daughters—and her stockpiles—from the lazy hordes who didn’t plan ahead. “Being prepared is now just acting responsibly, especially for moms,” she says. She sells freeze-dried and survival products through her online Prepper Market, but in truth, she has a touch of scorn for the parvenu Wise-buying prepper-lite. “Those just-add-water meals can work in a pinch, but they’re not tasty or healthy long-term,” she admonishes. “You need more than just products, you need knowledge about how to prepare and season freeze-dried foods. You need a culture of preparedness.” Luther, like Jackson, sees a movement arising from the reasonable concerns of citizens who recognize that we’re up against increasing environmental threats on the one hand and diminishing government safety nets on the other.

“Luck favors the prepared,” Jackson says more than once during my visit. I still have yet to invest in this luck, but I’ve begun to consider it. I live in Nashville in a flood-prone region that was hammered by rains when Harvey and Irma swept inland. My friends and neighbors might actually welcome those 72-hour survival kits Wise promotes after Black Friday if I give them as holiday gifts. We can stuff them in the corners of our pantries and hope like hell we never have to add water.","united nations intergovernmental panel

Kyle Stock,"Phil Knight’s landmark running shoe, the Cortez, just couldn’t keep pace.",2017-11-21T10:00:09Z,bloomberg,How Adidas Beat Nike at the Old School Game,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-11-21/nike-s-cortez-sneakers-and-its-failed-run-at-old-adidas-cool,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i.D32tmdS6N0/v1/-999x-999.gif,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"In 1967, the company that would become the world famous shoe brand Nike needed an identity for its new, state-of-the-art running shoe.

Co-founders Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman settled on “Aztec,” according to Knight’s autobiography. But industry giant Adidas had a track spike called “Azteca Gold” and was allegedly threatening to sue.

Chewing over their choices, the Oregon entrepreneurs fired the first volley of a decades-long rivalry with the German shoemaker. Knight explained how their displeasure with Adidas led to the eventual selection. “Who was that guy who kicked the (crap) out of the Aztecs?” Bowerman asked Knight. “Cortez,” he responded. “Okay,” Bowerman said, “let’s call it the Cortez.”

In the 50 years since that fateful (if impolitic) branding decision, Nike became both commercial behemoth and cultural phenomenon, catering to the feet of athletes and couch potatoes alike.

But by last year, the tide of the long battle had turned. Adidas AG was once again ascendant via two sneakers originally designed in the 1960s: the Stan Smith and the Superstar. They outsold every other kick in America and sent Adidas’s share of the U.S. footwear market skyward by 83 percent—with much of those gains swiped from Nike.

Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike Inc. was losing ground for the first time in decades. Future orders fell 4 percent in three months ended February, from both retail partners and the company’s own stores. Every geographic region, save emerging markets, posted a major drop in business.

Nike really needed a winner—a surefire hit that would once again fill sidewalks and stadiums with Swooshes, from the runways of SoHo to the pressure-sensing track that Knight bought for the University of Oregon. In September of last year, Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker started laying the groundwork. He told analysts and investors that, like Adidas, Nike would look to past successes to win today’s market. The Cortez, he announced, would be making a comeback.

The reboot was big, even by Nike standards. In May, the company enlisted supermodel Bella Hadid for an elaborate photo shoot. First she reclined across the bench seat of a massive, Jimmy Carter-era car, the sneakers brilliant against the brown velour. Next she sat on a metallic-gold BMX bike, her shoes stuffed with white-cotton dad socks. Then she squatted down with a tiny skateboard, wearing a sports-bra and high-waisted, flared jeans, a nod to a decades-old shot of 1970s favorite Farrah Fawcett.

Sneakerhead blogs and fashion magazines ran the photos as a story unto themselves.

A post shared by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Jun 9, 2017 at 1:29pm PDT

A few months later, Nike expanded the Cortez campaign, hiring Kendrick Lamar to be its pitchman, a partnership the musician blasted on social media with a plug for the old/new shoe.

Meanwhile, the company whipped its designers and factories up to speed, cranking out a steady stream of special Cortez editions to complement the classic iteration, with its red swoosh and blue stripe—what sneaker fanatics call “the Forest Gumps.” In May, there was the “Compton” colorway, flicking at the shoe’s popularity in Los Angeles street culture, and the “Kenny Moore” collection, a reference to an Oregon track star. In June, the company dropped a pair featuring its popular Flyknit upper material. In July, there was another collection, this time a collaboration with Mister Cartoon, a designer best known for celebrity tattoos and graffiti. Nike even stamped out a China edition, honoring the country’s first world champion in track.

Nike was in for a rude awakening. Despite all the effort, customers just didn’t seem to care.

Matt Powell, a sneaker analyst at NPD Group Inc., said Cortez sales this year have been “very minor,” even with the media blitz. “No retailer is talking to me about this shoe,” he said. Adding insult to injury is the cost of all this “demand creation,” eating up 10 percent of revenue. Hadid, Lamar and those excellent photographers don’t come cheap.

There are still plenty of Cortez kicks—both standard and esoteric—filling the shelves at Stadium Goods, which has two sneaker stores in lower Manhattan. “Some of the marketing push has definitely resonated,” said owner John McPheters. “Though it hasn’t turned it into a high-volume shoe for us.”

Nike declined to comment on the shoe’s fortunes or provide any sense of how much money it has spent on its Cortez campaign.

Of more concern than a dearth of sales, though, is the reboot’s poor showing on social media (Kendrick Lamar notwithstanding). Among 200 people whom analytics firm Traackr Inc. deems “influencers” in the sneaker market, the Cortez garnered a respectable volume of mentions this year, though not as many as the Air Max 97, its sibling sneaker. Of course, mentions are often purchased, particularly when “influencers” are involved. What’s more telling is engagement—the wider circle of dialogue that captures “likes,” reposts and comments. And this is where Adidas still shines with its Superstar shoe.

And that’s not the only good news for the German brand. In the middle of the Cortez rollout, Adidas overtook the Nike Jordan brand as the No. 2 sneaker name in America. Andrew Raisman saw the buzz first-hand as he launched Copdate, an app that helps consumers reserve highly anticipated, limited-release shoes (rather than wait in line outside a store). Raisman said Adidas has been masterful in making its retro models relevant and stoking demand with so-called super-consumers, including fashion models and sneaker geeks. The main Nike brand is still No. 1, but that isn’t as much of a given as it once was.

“They’re the pretty girl of the dance today,” Raisman said of Adidas. “That’s one of the things that makes the Cortez release less white-hot than it could be. Five years ago, it would have been a different story.”

The failure of the Cortez to gain traction is doubly surprising because, after all, reintroducing an old shoe is a pretty low-risk strategy. The economics are attractive since demand has been proven and the cost structure is slim. The research and development process for a decades-old shoe such as Cortez is essentially an intern who said: “What if we made them in velvet?” (They did.)



Plus, the value on such old-school wheels lies in that history. The Cortez experiment is akin to Ferrari cranking out new versions of its 1962 racecars, since the shoe was the company’s premier product when Nike became Nike. “It really was the shoe that started it all,” said Jordan Geller, founder of the Shoezeum, dubbed the world’s greatest sneaker museum. At one time, Geller’s collection had 30 pairs of the Cortez, the dearest of which cost him $300. When he moved the Shoezeum to Las Vegas, he settled on a building next to the El Cortez hotel. “I considered it a good sign,” he said.

Financially, Nike said it’s still on track for $50 billion in sales, and it still has some of the hottest shoes on the market; this year, that includes the Roshe and the aforementioned Air Max 97. What’s worrisome is how little attention consumers appeared to have paid to its marketing.

In today’s media landscape, it’s tougher than it used to be to win on big, slick set pieces that blanket the landscape—the type of campaign that built Nike through Michael Jordan’s career. Now companies have to score in the run of play—having the right people in the right places making a series of small, skillful decisions on social media and in stores.

In rebooting the Stan Smith line, Adidas crafted a campaign that was more shaggy than slick. First, it quietly pulled them from the market. Then it shipped customized pairs to select celebrities as it prepared to ramp up production. The subtle approach helped accelerate “normcore” momentum the sneakers already had on the fashion circuit.

In the end, the Stan Smith caught fire because a famous designer casually wore a pair out on a Paris catwalk, no fancy photo shoot required. McPheters, at Stadium Goods, said the Air Max 97 reboot has been a hit in part because it was less hyped. “It’s not something they’ve been milking for years,” he said.

Nike CEO Parker is no longer talking about the Cortez

Nike, for its part, posted a further 3 percent drop in North American sales in September and said it would stop reporting future orders. A little more than a year after his initial announcement, CEO Parker is no longer talking about the Cortez. He didn’t mention it during the company’s annual conclave with Wall Street analysts in October, though he called out several other models. In fact, the company only referenced “classic” styles twice that day, while it trumpeted “innovation” 96 times.

The future of Nike, Parker said, is in 3D modeling, an accelerated system for designing new sneakers and being a company geared to “better serve the consumer personally, at scale.” In short, the company will increasingly react to its customer, rather than hope the opposite holds true. Its experience with the Cortez reboot—however inexpensive, given the company’s size—shows this to be a reasonable strategic pivot.

Still, Nike hasn’t given up on the old shoe entirely. The company is working on a new version of the Cortez with Lamar. The sneaker blogs are abuzz.","nike cortez washington square park manhattan

Matthew Kronsberg,"Navdy, a $499 heads-up display system, is on the front end of a category-altering technology.",2017-11-22T13:00:09Z,bloomberg,A Dashboard Gadget That Will Totally Change How You Drive,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-22/a-dashboard-gadget-that-will-totally-change-how-you-drive,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwlm0m0EjMns/v0/1200x760.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"It was the last car on the rental lot: a white Nissan Altima that looked as if it had hit every pothole and puddle between Ohio, where it got its license plate, and Fort Lauderdale, where it was now parked.

I was at the beginning of a long weekend and had about 600 miles of driving ahead of me. This time, I vowed, I would give myself the kind of upgrade the rental agency wouldn’t—a heads-up display from Navdy, a $499 aftermarket gadget that sits on top of your dash and gives almost any car that Top Gun feeling.

Source: Navdy

My usual routine, whether driving my own car or in a rental, is to fire up Google Maps on my phone, stick it in the cup holder, and steal glances as necessary. The promise of heads-up display technology, on the other hand, is that it gives you the information you need as a driver—speed and navigation, primarily—without ever taking your eyes off the road. Using technology first applied in fighter jets, this is typically done by projecting the information onto your windshield in such a way that it appears to float in space, usually right around the the end of the hood of your car.

Those displays are floating above many hoods these days. The 2018 Lincoln Navigator, which uses a “digital light projection” technology frequently used in movie theaters, creates what they say is the largest, brightest automotive display in its category. Because your line of sight needs to be just so to see the HUD, some luxury cars like Mercedes and Volvos will save the position of the display to match your seat settings. Not all car makers have embraced the technology, however. Drive a Porsche or a Tesla, or an old Audi, for example, and you are out of luck.

Source: Navdy

Enter Navdy. It’s the leader in a growing field that ranges from budget apps, which reflect your phone’s screen onto your windshield, to Garmin’s $179 HUD+. The Navdy consists of an adhesive base, which sticks to the dashboard; the display unit, which connects to the base magnetically; and a scrolling thumb controller that straps onto the steering wheel.

The Navdy projects its information onto a clear lens, about 6 inches wide and 2 inches high. (Mazda also uses this lens-based approach). The effect, ultimately, is the same as a HUD that’s embedded in your dash, even if the implementation is a little unwieldy.

It gets its information from two sources: your phone, which connects via Bluetooth and its app, and the car’s on-board diagnostic, or OBD-II port, through which the Navdy collects such performance data about your vehicle as speed, engine temperature, and fuel consumption. The OBD-II port also provides power to the Navdy, which means that it works only in cars made after 1996, when the port became standard. It also means a cable runs from the base to the OBD-II port, usually located beneath the base of your steering wheel, or near the fuse panel. Cable stays keep the whole affair tidy, but there’s no way to hide the wires entirely.

Source: Navdy

Installation takes about 15 minutes, but getting used to the display takes a little longer. The default mode shows speed and RPM in the center, with additional information—time, g-force, engine temperature, and compass heading—in flanking displays you can scroll through as needed. Alerts for lurking speed cameras, or subtle notifications for the vanishingly rare moments I exceeded the speed limit, made themselves known without being distracting. When in GPS mode, the bulk of the display is filled with a turn-by-turn map display. Destinations are entered by voice—just hold down the button on the thumb wheel and say where you want to go.

Beyond the purely functional aspects of driving, Navdy serves as something of a media and communications hub. Alongside your speed or navigation information, emails and text messages can pop up in “Glances,” should you choose to have them do so. There’s an option to have them read aloud, as well. You can also engage or dismiss these messages with a wave of your hand, though I found that the thumb wheel was a more natural, less distracting way of dealing with them. Replies are canned (“I’m driving with Navdy. Call me”) but customizable.

For the first few hours, particularly while I was noodling around with it to set up Spotify over the car’s speakers, I found it could be just as diverting as anything on my dashboard. After a while, it became a part of the landscape, like any other road sign or traffic signal. It was only when I returned to my own car, with my cup-holder GPS method, that I realized the extent to which my eyes were taken from the road by that arrangement.

But I left it thinking that this is the way we’ll all be driving in the future. Like the transition to electric—or autonomous—vehicles, HUDs seem to be a logical, inevitable next step.

Breitbart News,"In a wide-ranging interview with Mike Morones of Recoil Magazine, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, President Trump’s former national security deputy advisor, discusses was the ""fake news industrial complex"" and the obsession over alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin's Russia -- an allegation that Gorka calls ""pure fantasy.""",2017-11-25T11:50:25Z,breitbart-news,Gorka: ‘Pure Fantasy’ to Think ‘Trump Campaign Was in Bed with Vlad’,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/25/gorka-pure-fantasy-think-trump-campaign-bed-vlad/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/sebastian-gorka-may-2-2017-ap.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"From Recoil’s Q&A with Gorka:

Whom do you trust for news these days?

SG: The media has changed. Read Andrew Breitbart’s seminal book Righteous Indignation; we are all producers of copy today. If you have a mobile phone you’re a citizen journalist. The problem today is the fake news industrial complex. When CNN, MSNBC, Politico, Huffington Post, New York Times, and Washington Post are so politically demented that they actually stated on election night that Hillary Clinton had a 90- to 96-percent chance of winning, you know something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

Too much of what we call mainstream today is all about a political agenda, sensationalism, and profits for corporate owners. Not too long ago media concerns lost money by design because they were performing a service. Now it’s your job to keep them straight, dear reader.

What about Russian interference in the U.S. election and the special counsel? Is this an important topic?

SG: Only for the Loony Left that’s been, ironically, in bed with Moscow since 1917. The Kremlin has been mucking around in democratic elections around the world since its inception. That’s not news. But the idea that the Trump campaign was in bed with Vlad is pure fantasy. It’s just yet another way for the losing candidate to ignore her own culpability for her abysmal performance.

What’s caused the erosion of trust in the media?

SG: Their transparently partisan behavior. When you accuse the president of being an anti-Semite when the man’s grandchildren are Orthodox Jews, the American people just switch off — and rightly so.","cnn msnbc politico huffington post new york times and washington post

Baldwin’s social media screed was in response to a tweet from Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., that Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) had been accused by two more women of inappropriately touching them.

Baldwin, 54, responded by accusing Donald Trump of flirting with his wife, singer Chynna Phillips, who he has been married to since 1995.

“Your Dad is a 5th-degree black belt when it comes to sexual impropriety allegations,” Baldwin tweeted in response. “In fact … I once had a party at the Plaza Hotel … your father showed up uninvited & hit on my wife … invited her on his helicopter to Atlantic City. She showed his fat ass the door. #TrumpRussia.”

Baldwin then went on to detail another claim that an “insecure” Donald Trump checked up on his then-mistress Marla Marples while she was taking acting classes with Baldwin in the 1980’s.

“Think that’s good… wait till I tell you about doing scenes in acting class with Marla Maples (terrific person!!) in the late 80s,” Baldwin wrote. “It was before Ivana or the press even knew. We rehearsed in her apartment & Donny Boy would call every 20 mins to check up on us. #VeryInsecureDude.”

Baldwin, who is the brother of Saturday Live Night star Alec Baldwin, has starred in a number of ’90s films including Backdraft and Sliver, as well as TV series such as Parenthood, Hawaii Five-0 and Dirty Sexy Money.

Alec Baldwin, who impersonates Trump as part of the comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live, has also admitted to “bullying” women and treating them in a “very sexist way.”

Dr. Susan Berry,"A federal judge has struck down a Texas law that bans second-trimester dismemberment abortions, those in which an unborn baby is “torn limb from limb” and then evacuated from the uterus.",2017-11-25T09:19:41Z,breitbart-news,Federal Judge Overturns Texas Ban on Dismemberment Abortions,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/11/25/federal-judge-overturns-texas-ban-dismemberment-abortions/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/01/fetal-ultrasound.png,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"A federal judge has struck down a Texas law that bans second-trimester dismemberment abortions, those in which an unborn baby is “torn limb from limb” and then extracted from the uterus.

U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel ruled that banning dismemberment abortion – a form of “D&E” (dilation and evacuation) abortion – places an “undue burden” upon women.

advertisement

“The State’s valid interest in promoting respect for the life of the unborn, although legitimate, is not sufficient to justify such a substantial obstacle to the constitutionally protected right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability,” the judge wrote.

In a medical animation video provided by pro-life organization Live Action, former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino demonstrates a second-trimester D&E abortion during which the abortionist uses instruments to remove the limbs from an unborn baby, between 13 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, prior to extraction from the uterus:

Texas Senate Bill 8 criminalizes dismembering an unborn child within the uterus. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the measure into law in June, slating it to go into effect September 1. Yeakel, however, temporarily blocked the Texas law at the end of August after the Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit that challenged the new statute:

BREAKING: Texas court strikes down a ban on the safest and most common second trimester abortion method! That's something to be thankful for this Thanksgiving Eve. #TXDeservesBetter pic.twitter.com/jk5Jd28X0W — Center for Reproductive Rights (@ReproRights) November 22, 2017

Attorney General Ken Paxton said he is appealing the ruling to the 5th Circuit:

A five-day trial in district court allowed us to build a record like no other in exposing the truth about the barbaric practice of dismemberment abortions. We are eager to present that extensive record before the 5th Circuit. No just society should tolerate the tearing of living human beings to pieces. We are hopeful the 5th Circuit will respect the will of the Texas Legislature by upholding Texas’ lawful authority to protect the dignity of innocent unborn children as they die.

The abortion industry claims dismemberment is one of the “safest” abortion procedures.

Media allies of the abortion industry often draw attention away from the gruesome nature of dismemberment abortion by emphasizing how “common” it is. The Texas Tribune headline reads, “Judge strikes down Texas ban on common abortion procedure.”

Cecile Richards, president of abortion industry giant Planned Parenthood, tweeted she is “grateful” for Yeakel’s decision and that “politics should never tie the hands of doctors or bar women from safe medical care — in Texas or anywhere else”:

Grateful that another court agrees politics should never tie the hands of doctors or bar women from safe medical care — in Texas or anywhere else. https://t.co/gCMLJpVN5V — Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) November 23, 2017

Planned Parenthood spent about $30 million in the 2016 presidential election to send Hillary Clinton – who said unborn babies have no constitutional rights – to the White House.

Concerning the statue and the judge’s ruling, Texas Right to Life said:

The Dismemberment Abortion Ban outlaws a specific abortion procedure in which a living preborn child is killed by being torn limb from limb in utero. The Dismemberment Abortion Ban was Texas Right to Life’s top priority for the 85th Session of the Texas Legislature and was the most widely supported Pro-Life policy platform plank for the Republican Party of Texas … The amendment passed with overwhelming bipartisan support of House members on a vote of 92-42, and Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 8 as amended into law shortly after the session. The legal challenge from abortion providers and the Center for Reproductive Rights comes as no surprise to Pro-Life advocates. Texas Right to Life anticipated such a legal challenge to the strongest Pro-Life legislation of the session, and still chose the Dismemberment Abortion Ban as the next logical step for the Pro-Life movement in undermining the legal foundation of Roe v. Wade. Pro-Life legal scholars anticipate that the Dismemberment Abortion Ban will successfully stand in court like the federal Partial Birth Abortion Ban, which also outlawed a specific and particularly gruesome and inhumane abortion procedure.

Breitbart News’s senior legal editor Ken Klukowski said, “Current Supreme Court precedent does not block states from passing laws on this nature, which to millions of Americans appeal to their sense of humanity, as they see the baby on ultrasound at this stage acting like a baby.”","republican party of texas

Clearly, the whole concept of attempting to shut down Chicago’s “Magnificent Mile” shopping district has lost its allure for activists, as only about 100 protesters turned out Friday to demonstrate for just an hour before disbanding and giving up the fight.

advertisement

For the third consecutive year, protesters gathered at Chicago landmark Water Tower Place shopping mall before walking south down Michigan Avenue to protest the Chicago police. As they marched, they chanted and yelled at shoppers entering and exiting the many stores in the heavily trafficked shopping area, the Chicago Tribune reported.

One shopper seemed relieved that there was not “really” anything going on. “When I heard them hollering, I said ‘let’s hope there’s nothing really going on,'” Constance Steele told the paper.

The marchers, however, were peaceful, and it does not appear they caused much disruption for retailers. Thus, this year’s march was a far cry from the last two years of protests that saw multiple arrests and violence, causing retailers to lose sales.

This year’s effort was understated, indeed, compared to last year. Last year, there were far more protesters, the protests lasted much longer, and the affair was raucous enough for police to arrest at least three demonstrators.

In 2016, the protesters bottled up shoppers on Black Friday for several hours, causing retailers to lose sales. Three protesters were also arrested after trying to block shoppers from entering the Crate & Barrel store on Michigan Avenue.

But 2016 was mild compared to the troubles protesters caused in 2015, the first year of the anti-police protest.

For the first Black Friday protest in the Windy City, hundreds of protesters shut down the Magnificent Mile shopping district for hours on end. Protesters linked arms in front of stores to prevent shoppers from entering, and the Chicago Police Department arrested about half a dozen on misdemeanor charges.

Worse, retailers reported that tens of thousands of dollars were lost to the protests. According to a 2015 report by the Tribune, stores lost between 25 and 50 percent of their normal Black Friday sales during the protests that year.

But with the 2017 protests now concluded, it is obvious that the whole scheme has resulted in diminishing returns and increasing disinterest, even among the protesters.

This is the only logical conclusion to be drawn from a series of data leaks and Freedom of Information (FOI) revelations exposing the relationship between left wing campaigners and the great climate change scam.

advertisement

Global warming, it becomes clear, is primarily a left-wing political issue, not a scientific one. Green is the new red.

These leaks show how rich liberal backers—left-wing institutions like the Rockefeller Foundation, eco hedge-fund billionaires like Tom Steyer, and the various socialistic Geek Emperors of Silicon Valley—are funneling millions of dollars into sock-puppet environmental organizations both to undermine Trump’s economic agenda and to finance his political opponents both in the Democratic Party and the GOP.

U.S. Climate Alliance

This poses as “a bi-partisan coalition of states is committed to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.” Or so the website says. But anyone can set up a website.

The truth, as the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) has discovered through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-requested email correspondence, is that U.S. Climate Alliance is just a front. Its real purpose is to enable the richly funded green lobby to buy up Democrat governors—and one, token, squishy Republican governor: Gov. Charlie Baker (MA)—by effectively bribing them with free office, research and staffing facilities which they can run off books.

There is nothing actually illegal in any of this. But to appreciate how ethically dubious it is, just consider how the liberal media would respond if the roles were reversed and it were conservative politicians being provided with all these off-books services by, say, the fossil fuel industry.

Chris Horner, who initiated the FOIA for the CEI, put it like this in the Washington Times:

Mr. Horner asked how the media would react if, for example, the Koch brothers provide staffing on behalf of a Republican governor. “This would unleash a tsunami of Pulitzers and hysteria if the political parties or priorities were changed,” said Mr. Horner. “Here is a real test for ‘good government’ activists—is this all right if the ‘right’ politicians and donors pushing the approved agenda outsource government?”

What the emails show is the intimate relationship between the liberal donors, green sock puppet organizations and Democrat politics.

Energy in Depth Climate reports here on some of the details:

Climate activist groups, most notably Climate Nexus—a sponsored project of the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors—act as the press arm for these governors’ offices at no charge. They also operate as a “shadow staff”to support climate change communications efforts, and supplied research later promoted by these state governors as their own. This includes at least one for-profit contractor, raising the question who its actual paying client is.

The three main Democrat governors fronting the U.S. Climate Alliance are Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, California Gov. Jerry Brown and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

But the people actually running it are green lobbyists and activists, doing the bidding of their wealthy anonymous donors in liberal strongholds like Silicon Valley, as well as the usual liberal suspects such as the Rockefeller and Hewlett Foundations. One prominent figure is Jeff Nesbit, Executive Director of a green organization called Climate Nexus. In the emails he is revealed in close discussion with Sam Ricketts, director of Jay Inslee’s Washington DC office.

According to the Washington Times:

“How come governors aren’t even listed on the website?” Mr. Ricketts asked in a June 5 email. Mr. Nesbit replied: “They will be! I promise. It’s controlled by WWF [apparently referring to the World Wildlife Fund]. They’re melting down over there. I’ll make sure the 9 governors are listed ASAP.” Mr. Nesbit also wore the hat of press secretary, saying he needed to send a joint statement from Mr. Inslee, Mr. Brown and Mr. Cuomo to The New York Times. “Do you have it? Is it approved? Is Inslee available to talk to the NYT and others today before Trump does his Rose Garden ceremony at the WH?” Mr. Nesbit asked in the June 1 email. According to Mr. Nesbit, Climate Nexus, a sponsored project of the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, provided its services free of charge and without a contract.

What becomes clear from the emails is the extent of sock puppetry—which the Green Blob uses to give the impression of representing many disparate groups, when in fact they are all just a small group of the same people wearing different hats. There is no shortage of money to support this scam.

According to the Washington Times:

Even before Mr. Trump announced his intention in June to exit the 2015 Paris climate accord, state employees in California, New York and Washington had discussed enlisting the help of outside advocacy groups. Aimee Barnes, senior adviser to Mr. Brown, proposed reaching out to the Georgetown Climate Center, Under2 Coalition and others, saying that “it can’t always be us staff running around trying to corral each other for sign on.” “We are fortunate that at the moment there are many resources keen to be at our disposal to support us further, but in order to make the best use of them, we need to tell them what we need,” Ms. Barnes said in a May 5 email. Mr. Ricketts responded in a May 9 email by noting, “There’s of course a plethora of advocate and funder interest,” adding, “We can approach the different groups (G-town, Rhodium, UNF, whomever) about which of them will play a roll.” A week later, Georgetown Climate Center Deputy Director Kathryn Zyla provided an update in an email sent to state staffers and climate change advocates. “We also wanted to let you know that we are working with the Georgetown IT department to develop a platform that can assist this group with communications and shared resources, and will keep you posted. (Please let us know if you have any thoughts on key features for that platform.),” Ms. Zyla said in a May 16 email. GCC spokesman Chris Coil said the group had no contract with the states. “We support state engagement on climate change (as we have done on a bipartisan basis for many years) free of charge,” he said. Inslee senior adviser Chris Davis put in a plug for Ann McCabe and her team at the Climate Registry, calling them in a June 5 email, “Great partners who’ve covered our costs for COPs and provided extraordinary on site services and support.”

Inevitably, there is a Clinton connection to all this skullduggery:

In another instance, the Alliance released a report about economic output and greenhouse gas emissions. Although branded as their own research, it turns out that the report relied almost exclusively on data compiled by the Rhodium Group—an organization headed by a former Hillary Clinton energy and climate advisor, Trevor Houser. Indeed, given that the central focus of the emails obtained by CEI is tapping the “plethora of advocate and funder interest” in providing support functions which were beyond the ability of the governors’ offices, it seems far more likely this pricey gift was provided to the governors by the for-profit Rhodium Group. What isn’t yet clear is which clients paid for this glossy product of a high-priced consultancy. It’s unsurprising that the Rockefellers have found a way to exert their influence inside state governors’ offices. Climate Nexus has also been heavily involved in promoting the #ExxonKnew campaign for the Rockefellers. When the RICO 20—a group of professors who petitioned the Obama administration to bring racketeering charges against those who disagreed with the president’s climate agenda—faced enormous backlash for their efforts to silence dissent, Climate Nexus rushed in to clean up the mess. You see, the RICO 20 was suggesting that the government prosecute individual climate skeptics, which got in the way of the Rockefellers’ plans to have the government go after energy companies. Climate Nexus also receives funding from the Energy Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, two other groups heavily involved in backing the #ExxonKnew campaign.

The Great Republican Carbon Tax Myth

Earlier this year I reported here and here for Breitbart News on the bizarre spectacle of various Republican elder statesmen—including Reagan-era Secretary of State George Shultz—campaigning to “combat climate change” by agitating for a carbon tax. Naturally the New York Times got very excited at the idea that conservatives were starting to see the light.

The truth: there is next to zero support, anywhere within the GOP, for something as stupid and frankly socialistic as a carbon tax.

During the 2016 Presidential campaign, every major Republican candidate with the exception of Lindsay Graham opposed a carbon tax

May 2016, prospective GOP nominee Donald Trump publicly tweeted his opposition to a carbon tax in response to a news story

resolution opposing a carbon tax June 2016, House Republicans, led by Rep. Steve Scalise, passed opposing a carbon tax

a carbon tax July of 2016, the RNC adopted changes to the Republican platform opposing

a carbon tax 2016, state GOP parties began adopting resolutions in advance of the Cleveland Convention opposing

candidate questionnaire August 2016, candidate Donald Trump responded in writing to a opposing both a carbon tax and the concept of social cost of carbon

So why does this zombie concept keep clawing its way out of the grave?

Because, yet again, we’re being played by the usual suspects: a handful of extremely well-funded lobbyists using their money and influence to give the impression of widespread, cross-party demand for what is in fact only the preoccupation of such paid-up Green Blob members as Elon Musk. They planned this far in advance.

This is clear from two leaked campaign documents dating back to 2015.

One is from the National Wildlife Federation. Its strategy explicitly states that its plan is to co-opt conservatives into its carbon tax scheme:

The Wind Energy Foundation, National Wildlife Federation (NWF), EDP Renewables North America (EDPR), Renewable Energy Systems Americas Inc. (RES), Pattern Energy, and Tesla Motors are working in a cross-sector coalition to enact a federal price on carbon pollution. We believe that a carbon tax or similar price on carbon pollution is achievable in Congress within five years as part of a grand political bargain on tax and fiscal policy. The key to this success will be the effective deployment of business and conservation leaders and their networks, who will create a non-threatening, non-ideological space for conservative decision makers to engage on climate policy. We anticipate that this campaign will be complemented with efforts in the political sphere to hold accountable those who are unresponsive to our network members or to defend those who are responsive.

Note the presence of Tesla on this list: Mr President—Elon Musk is not your friend!

The other is another 2015 strategy document, floated among D.C. think tanks, created with the aim to “Engage Congress on Carbon Pricing.”

Again, the tactic used to achieve this was to reposition a carbon tax as an essentially free-market, pro-business solution in order to attract conservative support.

“Carbon Funded Tax Cuts” will stimulate GDP growth, create jobs, make U.S. companies more competitive in the global market place, make the tax system fairer, and result in dramatic climate change benefits.

Did you see what they just did there? These people are sneaky.

And the money for these campaigns—coordinated by think tanks and lobby groups like RStreet and RepublicEn—is in turn funneled via organizations like the Energy Foundation.

Here is the Energy Foundation giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to RStreet.

Here it is donating $200,000 to another lobby group Niskanen.

There’s nothing illegal about this. Just something very dishonest and deliberately misleading.

It’s called Astroturfing.

The Green Blob wants you to believe that, right now, there are a heap of disparate groups of sincere campaigners all of which just happen to share the same worthy and noble mission to combat climate change.

Except they’re really not. They’re just a bunch of liberal sock puppets, bankrolled by plutocrats on a mission to allay their rich-guilt by splashing money on “saving the planet” and green industry rent-seekers who want to rig the market in favor of their renewable energy interests.

This is not about saving the planet. This is about greed—and left-wing politics.

Neil Munro,"Thanksgiving is not about English settlers thanking God for helping them survive in the wilderness they remake into the United States, but it is really about Americans' duty to welcome whatever migrants the government delivers to their door, according to the New York Times and various progressives.",2017-11-24T11:52:07Z,breitbart-news,Progressives: Thanksgiving Is All About Immigrants,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/24/progressives-say-thanksgiving-about-immigrants-not-americans/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_ap-photo1679-wi-e1445255607816.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Thanksgiving is not about English settlers thanking God for helping them survive in the wilderness they remake into the United States, but it is really about Americans’ duty to welcome whatever migrants the government delivers to their door, according to the New York Times and various progressives.

The Soviet-style rewrite of Americans’ culture was displayed by a New York Times’ editorial and by a firm of immigration lawyers, which tweeted the post-Thanksgiving message: “‘Thanksgiving’: Our National Holiday About Welcoming Immigrants.”

The New York Times argued that Thanksgiving is not about Americans, but about migrants’ supposed right sit down at the Americans’ own table.

Lincoln may well have anticipated all those [religious] convictions [of immigrants]— Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish and Christian — when in 1863 he proclaimed the last Thursday in November to be “a day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens.” It was formally changed in 1941 to the fourth Thursday in November. Lincoln knew his Bible, and was surely familiar with a passage from Exodus all too often ignored in our present era of hard feelings: “Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.” Lincoln mentioned God but no particular faith in his proclamation. We may presume that all were thus declared welcome to sit at the American table.

That open-borders theme was echoed by the progressive Catholic hierarchy, which issued a Thanksgiving message from Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. He declared:

So this year, I give thanks for the gift and contributions of immigrants and refugees to our great nation. I also pray that next year, families now under threat will not be broken and dispersed, but instead will be united in joy around their tables, giving thanks for all the blessings our nation has to offer.

Other progressives tried to make the Thanksgiving-is-about-immigrants claim. “Native Americans welcomed immigrant Pilgrims in the first Thanksgiving,” was the headline at an Alabama news site, Al.com, which insisted:

The Native Americans welcomed the arriving immigrants and helped them survive. Then they celebrated together, even though the Pilgrims considered the Native Americans heathens.

Beyond Borders, a pro-immigration website also tried to redefine Americans’ Thanksgiving holiday with tweets:

Besides, Americans and their children and grandchildren will never be allowed to be Americans — they must always remain immigrants in “a nation of immigrants,” according to the Beyond Border website.

A Nebraska progressive groups shared the same claim:

This Thanksgiving, our thoughts are with families who are separated by harsh & outdated immigration laws. We'll keep fighting for common-sense policies that keep families together on these special days. pic.twitter.com/kYuuwoLiGE — Nebraska Appleseed (@neappleseed) November 23, 2017

But most Americans recognize that Thanksgiving is about Americans’ society, not about foreigners.

The fact that you weren't at my thanksgiving dinner doesn't mean I hate you and am afraid of you, it means you're not part of my family and we didn't invite you. Same deal with limiting immigration. — PrincipiaAccordia (@dMandoli) November 24, 2017

And there are plenty of immigrants who also recognize that Thanksgiving is about Americans, not about foreigners. Catholic News shared this quote from Samuel Abu, a Liberian now working in Philadelphia for Catholic Social Services:","thanksgivingisaboutimmigrants

The president announced plans to speak with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Twitter.

According to the New York Times, the attack took place at a mosque where most of the victims were Sufi Muslims — considered heretical by extremist Muslims.

Terrorists triggered a bomb inside the mosque and sent gunmen to shoot people as they fled the scene.

In recent days, Trump has repeatedly stressed the need to build the wall, including on Twitter on Thanksgiving Day and after a border guard was was reportedly killed by illegal immigrants.","trump realdonaldtrump

The pro-amnesty celebrities are using their fame to lobby Ivanka Trump on the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, where nearly 800,000 illegal aliens have been given work permits and protected status to remain in the U.S.

In September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on behalf of the Trump administration that the DACA program would be ended in March 2018, leading the open borders lobby, the political establishment and corporate interests to scramble together to craft and pass multiple amnesty bills.

Via Instagram, celebrities are now participating in a concerted campaign using Ivanka Trump, who’s previously praised an amnesty plan for DACA illegal aliens, to push the Trump administration to sign off on an end-of-the-year immigration deal.

In what many suggest is defiance of President Trump’s pro-American immigration agenda, which does not include amnesty for illegal aliens, Ivanka Trump previously advocated publicly for DACA illegal aliens, calling them “innocent people” who needed to be allowed to remain in the U.S. permanently — and thus, allowed to eventually bring their extended foreign relatives to the U.S. as well.

“I am of the opinion — and the president has stated — that we have to figure out a good solution that protects these innocent people, many of whom were brought to the country as children,” Ivanka Trump said last month during a panel at the “Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit,” Breitbart News reported. “There has to be a long-term fix, it can’t be bandaged over on a presidential level by another executive order.”

Ivanka Trump’s statements were blasted by Trump’s base of supporters, including Angel Mom and co-founder of Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime (AVIAC) Mary Ann Mendoza, whose son Brandon Mendoza was murdered by an illegal alien.

@realDonaldTrump You better not let my son down. You PROMISED a border wall, you PROMISED no amnesty. EOW 5/12/21014 pic.twitter.com/sTpiH10WT1 — Mary Ann Mendoza (@mamendoza480) September 14, 2017

“I didn’t vote for Ivanka,” Mendoza told Breitbart News Daily radio at the time. “I voted for President Trump. And I’m sure if Ivanka had been affected by illegal criminal activity in her family, I think she’d have a different stance on this. I’d love to be able to meet with her face-to-face, look her in the eye as a mother to a mother and say, ‘Which child would you choose to lose at the hands of an illegal to support your agenda?’”

As Breitbart News reported, an amnesty under the DREAM Act, would spur a potential mass migration to the U.S. of potentially between 9.9 million to 19 million extended foreign relatives of the illegal aliens who are given a pathway to U.S. citizenship. This is what’s known as “chain migration.”

Every year, more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants are admitted to the U.S., with the current foreign-born population booming to an unprecedented high of roughly 44 million individuals. Mass immigration to the U.S. has been at the expense of American workers in the working and middle-class who have been forced to compete with foreign labor while their wages have remained stagnant.","trump’s proamerican immigration agenda

Natasha Bertrand,Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's...,2017-11-25T17:41:21Z,business-insider,Paul Manafort’s Russia ties are far more extensive than was previously known,http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-manafort-flight-records-russia-ties-mueller-2017-11,http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/597752835d8a2f25008b4f9e-1190-625/paul-manaforts-russia-ties-are-far-more-extensive-than-was-previously-known.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's flight records show that he traveled to Moscow at least 18 times while advising the pro-Russian strongman Viktor Yanukovych, who later became Ukraine's president.

Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014, but Manafort continued advising Ukraine's Opposition Bloc — a political party that is considered even closer to the Kremlin than Ukraine's Party of Regions.

Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, said Manafort’s trips to Russia were “related to his work on behalf of"" the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska’s ""commercial interests.”



President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, traveled to Moscow at least 18 times between 2004-2011, while he served as a top adviser to ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and the pro-Russia Party of Regions.

The flight records, which were obtained by McClatchy News from a government source in Kiev, suggest that Manafort's consulting work and business dealings were more closely linked to Russia than he has let on.

Manafort visited Ukraine at least 138 times between 2004-2015, according to McClatchy. He traveled to Moscow the most between 2005-2006, but took additional trips there through 2011.

Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 amid widespread protests over his last-minute decision to reject a deal that would have fostered stronger ties between Ukraine and the European Union, and instead pursued closer ties with Moscow. Yanukovych fled to Russia when the protests escalated, but Manafort continued advising Ukraine's Opposition Bloc — a political party that is considered even more pro-Russia than the Party of Regions.

Manafort's business dealings with Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs have come under intense scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.

Manafort's trips to Russia are not the only ones that may be of interest to Mueller. He and his longtime Russian-Ukrainian business associate Konstantin Kilimnik reportedly traveled to Frankfurt in July 2013 on a private plane owned by Andrey Artemenko — a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, and longtime Trump Organization adviser Felix Sater in January to present them with a Russia-Ukraine ""peace plan"" that involved easing sanctions.

A federal grand jury indicted Manafort and his longtime business associate, Rick Gates, in October on 12 counts, including money laundering, tax fraud, and failing to register as foreign agents. Federal prosecutors said in a court filing that both men had received ""millions of dollars"" from Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs that would allow them ""to live comfortably abroad"" and therefore make them a flight risk.

Citing financial documents filed in Cyprus, The New York Times reported in July that Manafort was in debt to pro-Russian interests by as much as $17 million by the time he joined Trump's campaign team in March 2016.

Manafort also has significant business ties to the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who signed a $10 million annual contract with Manafort in 2006 for a lobbying project in the US that Manafort said would ""greatly benefit the Putin Government,"" The Associated Press reported in March.

Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, told McClatchy that Manafort’s trips to Russia were “related to his work on behalf of Oleg Deripaska’s commercial interests.”

Maloni told Business Insider that airplane records ""do not demonstrate anything other than Mr. Manafort was in Moscow for his well-known commercial work with Oleg Deripaska or was connecting through Moscow on his way to and from the US.""

In July 2016, Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Deripaska in the hopes of resolving a years-long business dispute stemming from a failed business deal the two pursued in 2008 involving a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable.

Legal complaints filed by Deripaska's representatives in the Cayman Islands in 2014 said he gave Manafort $19 million to invest in the company, but the project fell through and Manafort all but disappeared without paying back Deripaska.

Deripaska's representatives were ""openly"" accusing Manafort of fraud and pledging to recover the money from him as recently as early 2016, according to the Associated Press. But they reportedly backed off the accusations shortly after Manafort joined the campaign in the spring.

'How do we use to get whole?'

Shortly after being named a campaign strategist in April, Manafort emailed his longtime employee Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian-Ukrainian operative with suspected ties to Russian intelligence.

""I assume you have shown our friends my media coverage, right?"" Manafort reportedly wrote to Kilimnik.

""Absolutely,"" replied Kilimnik. ""Every article.""

""How do we use to get whole,"" Manafort responded. ""Has OVD operation seen?""

Russia-linked entities dangled compromising information about Clinton to the Trump campaign at least twice after Manafort was enlisted to corral convention delegates in March 2016.

The campaign's stance on Russia's interference in eastern Ukraine did not seem aligned with traditional GOP orthodoxy, either: An amendment to the GOP's draft policy on Ukraine, which proposed that the GOP commit to sending ""lethal weapons"" to the Ukrainian army to fend off Russian aggression, was ultimately softened to say ""provide appropriate assistance"" before it was included in the party's official platform in 2016.

The Trump campaign also did not provide a letter to the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America recognizing Ukraine's 25th year of independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, according to McClatchy. The Clinton campaign did.

A young campaign foreign policy adviser named George Papadopoulos was told in late April that the Kremlin had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails,"" according to court documents filed by Mueller and unsealed late last month.

Papadopoulos asked Manafort in an email on May 21, after learning of the dirt, whether he could arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian officials: Russia has been eager to meet with Mr. Trump for some time and have been reaching out to me to discuss,"" he wrote.

Manafort forwarded that email to Gates, adding: ""Let's discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.""

A few weeks later, Manafort attended a meeting at Trump Tower on the promise of obtaining similar Clinton ""dirt"" from a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer.

Manafort's prominent campaign role and history of working with Ukrainian and Russia-linked entities apparently spurred the FBI to seek a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant to surveil him at least twice between 2014-2016.

Manafort resigned as Trump's campaign chairman shortly after The New York Times reported that the pro-Russia political party he had worked for had earmarked him $12.7 million for his work between 2007 and 2012. Ukrainian prosecutors have said they've found no proof of illicit payments to Manafort, who has said he never collected the payments.","congress committee of america recognizing ukraines

Investors have been happy to fund the company.

But Tesla has to get its act together with its Model 3 — and fast.



Suddenly, everyone is fixated on Tesla's cash burn. Bloomberg recently crunched the numbers and concluded that at its current pace of monetary incineration, Tesla will tap out next August.

The numbers are daunting. Tesla is spending more than $1 billion per quarter to sustain its existing business and ramp up production of its troubled Model 3. For a company building just three cars, that's worrisome. General Motors is also spending a billion every quarter — the biggest US automaker manufactures dozen of different vehicles worldwide and is on track sell almost 10 million cars and trucks.

From a return-on-investment-capital standpoint, Tesla is a catastrophe, while GM is a triumph. GM has been making money for years and is now seeing its stock climb to a post-IPO high point. Tesla just notched the biggest quarterly loss in the company's 14-year history.

That said, Tesla continues to enjoy a $50-billion-ish market cap (larger than Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) and a seemingly endless appetite for new capital raises and more recently, debt issuance. Get ready for more of that in either late 2017 or early 2018, as Tesla is going to be down to its last billion by year's end and will require a few more three-comma fundings to make it through the next 12 months.

The greatest show in the car business

In the meantime, CEO Elon Musk is in full-on showman mode — with designs on hitting up Tesla's wealthiest supporters and most futuristic customers for more money. In Los Angeles two weeks ago, he rolled out the Tesla Semi Truck — and started taking orders for it, at $5,000 a pop. He also surprised everybody with a new Roadster — and started taking orders for the $250,000 Founders Edition of the sports car. Tesla only opened up 1,000 reservations for the vehicle, and each buyer has to pay the $250,000 to reserve their spot.

You gotta do what you gotta do, and if Musk can bring in $250 million by selling 1,000 Roadsters years ahead of actually building the car, it will give Tesla a bit of breathing room on the cash front. As Greentech Media's Katie Fehrenbacher noted, that's more than Tesla raised with its 2010 IPO.

I've said that Musk is the greatest car salesman who has ever lived, and his latest moves bear out that observation.

But let's not kid ourselves, the next 12 months are going to be a very, very rough ride for Musk and his company. He has admitted that the Model 3 — a $35,000 base-priced EV — is in production hell, but it's actually worse than that. Musk had predicted monthly production of 20,000 vehicles by December, but Tesla will be lucky to build 1,000. The holdup is with a Tesla's battery factory in Nevada, and that's astonishing. Tesla is great at making batteries. This shouldn't be the weak link in the chain.

Elsewhere, GM could sell 5,000 of its Chevy Bolt EV in December. As that car begins to appear more often on US roads and as customers race to take advantage of a federal tax credit that Republican tax bill threatens to eliminate, Tesla is at real risk of losing Model 3 sales as customers demand that their $1,000 deposits be refunded.

Tesla has a long history of production problems

Tesla's core business of selling $100,000 luxury EVs to people who don't need a $7,500 tax incentive is in pretty good shape. The company could deliver 100,000 Model S's and Model X's in 2017, setting a record and consolidating a monopoly on premium electric vehicles.

But Tesla has also been weak in a critical fundamental: production. The Model S and Model X have fallen short of Tesla's deliveries guidance every year. I think this issue will resolve as 2017 winds down because the company is now maxed out on S and X manufacturing. As long as it maintains a steady 100,000 annually, all should be well.

The Model 3, meanwhile, is a production disaster. And it is sort of unprecedented in the auto industry — in two ways. First, because Tesla has 500,000 pre-orders for the vehicle, something that's never happened before for any automaker. Second, because if any other automaker had half a million pre-orders for anything, it would be moving heaven and Earth to get those vehicles to market. There's nothing intrinsically exotic about the Model 3, either. It's a midsize sedan. Toyota could build a million next year without breaking a sweat.

Investors don't care about this stuff, however. That's because the Tesla story is just too enticing.

Musk's storytelling captivates the public and investors

Don't discount the value of that! Musk is an unparalleled storyteller. I was at the Semi/Roadster unveiling, and it was the most thrilling event I've ever attended in a decade of covering the car business. There's an old saying in the industry about how you get people to part with many thousands to buy a depreciating asset: ""Show them the car!""

Musk doesn't just show. He sets a new standard for showing. In the flush of excitement, investors prevent the stock from crashing to where it probably should be fairly valued, at around $100-150 per share, and customers cough up the cash to be part of the frenzy.

This can't last forever. In fact, 2018 will be the critical test. If Tesla passes, the stock could vindicate the most bullish advocates at surge to $500. Or it could plummet, and fast. Look out below will be the order of the day.

If the latter, Tesla's bankruptcy risk will increase, but we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves. Yes, the Model 3 is a mess. But the core business can still be a profitable life raft, if the Model 3 proves to be the car that almost killed Tesla. And Musk can always sell off chunks of the company, as he has in the past to Daimler, Toyota, and most recently, Tencent. Heck, he could sell the entire company, although it would be a big bite.

For now, investor confidence, though battered, is holding. Everyone is on edge. But we wouldn't be talking about Tesla if we weren't.

Kate Taylor,Many stores looked empty this Black Friday...,2017-11-25T13:03:00Z,business-insider,Stores were emptier than ever this Black Friday — but sales are soaring,http://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-2017-sales-surge-stores-remain-empty-2017-11,http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5a18963e3dbef471018b8276-1190-625/stores-were-emptier-than-ever-this-black-friday--but-sales-are-soaring.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Many stores looked empty this Black Friday.

However, if retailers can pull off online success, there's no need to panic over a lack of crowds.

Online sales from Black Friday and Thanksgiving reached $6.3 billion on Friday evening.

Many stores were empty this Black Friday — but retailers have no need to panic.

Some shoppers were surprised to find empty Targets, Best Buys, and Walmarts when they showed up for Black Friday shopping.

When Business Insider's Sarah Jacobs arrived at the Atlantic Terminal Mall in Brooklyn early Friday morning, she found a meager line outside waiting for the mall to open, and even fewer people outside Target and Best Buy.

Empty malls seem like bad news for retailers. However, with the growth of e-commerce and services like in-store pickup, retailers can cut down on store traffic while still growing sales.

Shoppers spent a total of $3.54 billion online as of 8 p.m. ET on Black Friday, a 15.6% increase over last year according to Adobe Analytics. That's on top of the $2.87 billion spent on Thanksgiving Day.

Shoppers are expected to spend $107.4 billion online this holiday season, which would represent an increase of nearly 14% over last year, according to Adobe.

Another reason that stores are emptier is due to Black Friday sales being spread out almost a whole week instead of centered on a single day. Cyber Monday is anticipated to generate more money than Black Friday. Thanksgiving Day is also increasingly important, growing sales by almost 15% from 2016 to 2017, according to data collected by tax automation software provider Avalara.

Ultimately, when customers are in stores, that's not always a good thing. On Friday, Macy's had plenty of lines — but it was because the retailer's credit card system was down at many locations, and customers were struggling to check out and pay for their purchases.","retailers

Sonam Sheth,President Donald Trump's chief of staff...,2017-11-25T21:19:57Z,business-insider,John Kelly reportedly wanted Kushner and Ivanka Trump to leave the White House by the end of the year,http://www.businessinsider.com/john-kelly-considered-having-kushner-and-ivanka-leave-white-house-by-end-of-2017-2017-11,http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/59d64aa0351ccfd9008b8836-1190-625/john-kelly-reportedly-wanted-kushner-and-ivanka-trump-to-leave-the-white-house-by-the-end-of-the-year.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"President Donald Trump's chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, reportedly considered the possibility of senior adviser Jared Kushner and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, leaving the West Wing by the end of this year.

Trump has also grown frustrated with Kushner's political advice and is said to be urging his daughter and son-in-law to depart Washington, DC, and go back to New York.

Calls for Kushner's dismissal have grown since he began facing increased scrutiny in the Russia investigation.



President Donald Trump's chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, has considered the possibility of pushing senior adviser Jared Kushner and special assistant Ivanka Trump out of the West Wing by the end of the year, The New York Times reported on Saturday.

Kelly joined the White House in July after former chief of staff Reince Priebus departed and has sought to impose order upon a previously freewheeling West Wing. Before Kelly arrived, Kushner and Ivanka Trump enjoyed relatively unfettered access to Trump, coming and going to the Oval Office as they pleased, according to multiple media reports.

Since Kelly took over, however, multiple sources told The Times and The Washington Post that Kushner's vast portfolio — which initially included achieving peace in the Middle East, solving the opioid crisis, fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs, and being the administration's point person in dealing with China, Mexico, and Canada — has shrunk significantly. He now focuses primarily on working towards Middle East peace and oversees the Office of American Innovation.

Kelly, who stands as a buffer between Trump and the rest of the White House staff, has made it clear that he's in charge, telling associates, ""Jared works for me,"" according to The Times. And three advisers said that Kelly has discussed the possibility of Kushner and Ivanka Trump leaving the Trump administration all together by the end of 2017.

Kelly pushed back against that notion, telling The Times that ""there was honestly never a time when I contemplated getting rid of Jared and Ivanka."" He added that the Office of American Innovation, which Kushner conceptualized and now spearheads, has proven valuable.

Kelly is reportedly one of several in the Trump administration who want Kushner out. A Vanity Fair piece last week said Trump, too, wants his daughter and son-in-law to leave Washington, DC, and head back to New York.

""He keeps pressuring them to go,"" a source told Vanity Fair.

Kushner is a central figure in the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

Mueller is reportedly investigating the president's role in crafting a misleading statement his son Donald Trump Jr. released after it emerged that he met with a Kremlin-connected lawyerat Trump Tower in June 2016. Mueller is also examining whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice by firing James Comey as FBI director in May.

Kushner attended the June 2016 meeting, and multiple news reports have said he strongly urged Trump to fire Comey.

Kushner was also with Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey, during a weekend in early May when Trump put together a draft letter laying out the reasons he wanted to fire Comey.

Some members of Trump's defense team also wanted Kushner out earlier this summer, as he faced increased exposure in the Russia investigation.

The Vanity Fair report added that Trump was becoming frustrated with Kushner's political advice, including that Trump back Luther Strange in the runoff for the GOP nomination for the US Senate seat in Alabama previously held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Strange lost the nomination to Roy Moore, whose candidacy has been rattled by multiple sexual misconduct allegations and who is now in an increasingly competitive race against Democrat Doug Jones","kremlinconnected lawyerat trump

Sonam Sheth,Robert Mueller is looking into former national...,2017-11-25T13:24:09Z,business-insider,Mueller is eyeing Flynn's involvement in a film his lobbying firm did not want anyone to know about,http://www.businessinsider.com/mueller-michael-flynn-intel-group-fethullah-gulen-turkey-trump-russia-2017-11,http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/59cac5b98fdbfe1f008b46b4-1190-625/mueller-is-eyeing-flynns-involvement-in-a-film-his-lobbying-firm-did-not-want-anyone-to-know-about.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Robert Mueller is looking into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's involvement in the production of a film about an exiled Turkish cleric.

Flynn's consulting firm was tasked with producing the film last year and reportedly did not want anyone to know of its involvement in the project.

News of Mueller's latest focus on Flynn comes on the heels of a Thursday New York Times report which indicated that Flynn's team is negotiating or cooperating with Mueller's team.



The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is examining former national security adviser Michael Flynn's role in producing a documentary about an exiled Turkish cleric at the height of the 2016 presidential race, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Mueller is eyeing Flynn as part of his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether members of President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the race in his favor.

Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser in February after it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian officials during the transition period.

Mueller's focus on Flynn has to do primarily with those interactions, as well as his lobbying firm's activities and his failure to register as a foreign agent when the firm began lobbying on behalf of a businessman with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the latter half of 2016.

Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 in August 2016 by the businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who is also the head of the Dutch consulting firm Inovo.

Flynn Intel Group was tasked with fomenting dissent inside Turkey and with lobbying the US government to extradite the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who currently resides in Pennsylvania and whom Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year's attempted coup.

Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr. — who is also a subject of scrutiny in Mueller's probe — are believed to have been offered $15 million to extradite Gulen, according to media reports. Flynn's lawyers said those reports were false, calling them ""outrageous"" and ""prejudicial.""

The documentary Alptekin paid Flynn Intel Group to produce was never completed, but it was meant to focus on the supposed dangers Gulen posed. Alptekin told The Journal in May that he hoped the documentary would be ""a small, '60 Minutes' kind of a thing, where these conclusions are brought to the public.""

""We thought that might have a good effect,"" he said.

'We don't want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this'

Flynn Intel Group did not want anyone to know about its involvement in the film's production, according to David Enders, a former VICE News correspondent who was hired to work on the documentary. He told The Journal that Bijan Kian, a partner at the now-defunct group, told him, ""We don't want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this.""

Sources familiar with the matter told The Journal on Friday that prosecutors have contacted Enders as well as former CNN anchor Rudi Bakhtiar, who was hired to work on the film, to question them about their involvement in the project.

Kian has also become a focus for Mueller, NBC News reported this week. The special counsel is seeking to gauge what role, if any, Kian played in securing the Inovo contract for Flynn Intel Group.

Prosecutors additionally want to know whether Kian has any information about other lobbying efforts the firm may have undertaken that have not yet been disclosed. They are also interested in a September 2016 meeting featuring Kian, Flynn, and the pro-Russia congressman Dana Rohrabacher, according to NBC News.

Flynn Intel Group was required, under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, to register as a foreign agent as soon as it secured the contract with Inovo, but it did not do so until months later. It acknowledged in a March filing — four months after it the contract with Alptekin ended — that its work could have ""principally benefited"" Turkey.

Friday's revelation about Mueller's focus on Flynn's lobbying work came on the heels of a New York Times report saying that Flynn's defense team has ceased sharing information about the Russia investigation with Trump's lawyers.

It's common for defense attorneys representing people under investigation to share information with each other about what they've gleaned from prosecutors, according to former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti.

Usually, defense attorneys enter into a joint defense agreement, which entails that because each defense team's clients are on the same side, the attorneys' statements to each other are considered privileged information.

""The fact that Flynn's lawyers aren't sharing information with Trump's lawyers means that they believe it is no longer in Flynn's interest to do so,"" Mariotti wrote.

The development suggests that Flynn's attorneys are either cooperating with Mueller's team or that they are negotiating a plea deal, and that Flynn does not expect Trump to pardon him.","national security adviser michael flynns

Allan Smith,President Donald Trump and outgoing CFPB...,2017-11-25T17:39:14Z,business-insider,Dueling appointments set up a battle between Trump and Elizabeth Warren's favorite government agency,http://www.businessinsider.com/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-trump-cordray-cfpb-elizabeth-warren-2017-11,http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5a1999cbf914c351018b6031-1190-625/dueling-appointments-set-up-a-battle-between-trump-and-elizabeth-warrens-favorite-government-agency.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"President Donald Trump and outgoing CFPB director Richard Cordray both named his successor.

The opposing sides are now dueling over who has the legal right to do so.

The dust-up could lead to two people starting work on Monday believing that they are running the agency.



President Donald Trump and Richard Cordray, the recently departed head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, both named separate successors at the agency following Cordray's abrupt Friday exit, creating a fresh battle in Washington that could have significant ramifications for the agency that sprang up out of the financial crisis.

Both sides have claimed legal authority over the other to name the successor to an agency that was championed by the likes of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. It has also been vilified by much of the right, including by Office of Budget and Management Director Mick Mulvaney, the person named acting director of the CFPB by Trump on Friday night.

Cordray, who is expected by many to make a bid for Ohio's Democratic gubernatorial nomination, announced an earlier-than-expected departure from the agency Friday. He named his chief of staff, Leandra English, as the acting director of the CFPB. Cordray, nominated by President Barack Obama to lead the agency, announced that he would leave the position earlier this month.

That means on Monday, in all likelihood and unless some sort of agreement can be reached in the interim, two people will begin the work day believing they are running the agency.

Two sides start to take shape

After announcing Mulvaney, who once called the agency a ""sick, sad joke,"" as acting director, the White House argued that the Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows for Trump to override Cordray's selection. Those in opposition cited the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the agency, as evidence that Cordray, and not Trump, has the proper authority to name a replacement until a Trump-chosen successor is confirmed by the Senate.

Dodd-Frank calls for the agency's deputy director to serve as acting director when the director is absent or unavailable. Meanwhile, the Federal Vacancies Act allows for Trump to appoint any Senate-confirmed official, such as Mulvaney, as acting director of such an agency. Mulvaney will remain OMB director while serving as the CFPB's acting director.

The White House, which said in a statement that Trump looks forward to Mulvaney taking ""a common sense approach to leading the CFPB’s dedicated staff"" that ""will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,"" made its argument in a conference call with reporters Saturday morning.

Administration officials, who spoke on background, called the move ""typical"" and ""routine"" with years of precedent to back it up. They said the Federal Vacancies Act allows for Trump to supersede Dodd-Frank.

""The common objections that you hear in these various blog posts online is that, 'Oh, the CFPB statue said the CFPB deputy director shall serve as the director,"" one White House official said, according to The Hill. ""That’s clear in lots of these statues that the Vacancies Act trumps.""

The official added that the White House doesn't expect this clash to turn into a legal dispute.

""I know it makes it a better story if things are unpleasant and there’s a clash of two directors, but I don’t think it’s [at] all clear that’s going to happen,"" they said. ""I think there’s a very good chance that Director Mulvaney will come in on Monday morning and that will be end of things.""

But the official said Cordray's move to appoint a successor indicates ""that he is trying to provoke"" such a legal battle.

Most prominently arguing in favor of Cordray's right to appoint his interim successor was Warren, who tweeted Friday that Trump ""can nominate the next @CFPB Director — but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act.""

The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a @CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. @realDonaldTrump can’t override that. pic.twitter.com/r949ccaJAb — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) November 25, 2017

Others agreed that the Trump administration has the proper authority to name the interim successor, regardless of Dodd-Frank's language.

Trump ""is right,"" tweeted conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""Director Mulvaney is running @CFPB. If anyone tells him to pound sand, they’ll be pounding the pavement ala PATCO. We are not a government of unelected bureaucrats.""","likes of democratic sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts

Following is a transcript of the video.

Shelly Culbertson: I'm Shelly Culbertson, I'm a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and I study issues in the Middle East related to refugees, stabilization, and public sector development.

We've concluded that unless a series of urgent steps take place over the coming year to provide some of the prerequisites for Iraq to get back on a path to stability, violence could resume once again in a matter of months.

Given all of the American lives that we've lost, and the many, many Iraqi lives that have been lost, it's very much in US national interest to take a leading role in the stabilization of Mosul and other parts of Iraq as well as in the military victory.

The US has actually taken a very large role in the humanitarian effort. The US is the largest donor to humanitarian assistance and so its ongoing and sustained and additional support is really needed in order to prevent that to happen.

Mosul will require a number of steps in order to rebuild it and to set it back on a path to prosperity. I think many of the most important steps that are required will happen during the first year. Really providing a lot of the prerequisites so that it can rebuild and get on a path to growth again.

So one of those is figuring out how to deal with the displaced people that are from Mosul. So about 800 thousand people are still living displaced out of Mosul. So working on policies and plans to help them get back home. But for them to be able to come back home, they have to be able to go home and find intact homes, health, education, and so forth that are there.

One big obstacle to them going home is the level of explosive hazards that ISIS left. ISIS left mines, booby traps, etcetera really on an industrial scale. They did this as a tactic to keep civilians from coming back home. So they mined hospitals, pharmacies, schools, water lines, the level of baby cribs. A really big first step in order to make all of this happen is significant investment in demining. Not just in public utilities and services, but also in housing.

A next important step is making sure that the city is secure. In order to secure Mosul and prevent ISIS from moving right back in, the city requires about 60 thousand troops just to maintain the status quo. And unfortunately there's a risk that because of the ongoing fight against ISIS elsewhere that those troops could be drawn off.

Mosul also needs about 25 thousand trained police, and to date about 15 thousand have been hired and trained. And while the coalition is working on training other police, police who are important to keep the peace in the streets, prevent reprisals, prevent looting, that training isn't fast enough, so the situation is pretty urgent.

Mosul also requires investment in its public services. Rebuilding some of the water, electricity, sewage lines. That's under way. Schools are starting to open. But many of these things need a bit of a long-term plan. Both to build infrastructure, get the people back — the staff, the doctors, the nurses, the teachers — and to help do some of the indoctrination that happened during that time.

And finally, some bigger issues regarding governance and reconciliation will need to be addressed. Many communities in Ninawa Province, of which Mosul is the capital, just don't trust each other any more. There's a lot of trauma between the Sunnis, the Shiites, the Christians, the Yazidis, the Turkmen and so forth. And so there are some important steps that need to happen in terms of local reconciliation in addition to working with Baghdad on a broader national plan for reconciliation, particularly in a roadmap among the Sunnis, the Shiites, the Kurds, and others.","shelly culbertson

The retailer is buying ecommerce companies and instead of folding them into the Walmart brand, it's letting them operate independently.

The strategy should help Walmart appeal to higher-income shoppers and better compete with Amazon.



Walmart.com is morphing into a virtual mall, and it's starting to look a lot like Amazon.

The retailer has historically been laser-focused on growing its own brand and making the Walmart name bigger and bigger, said Doug Stephens, a retail industry consultant.

Now, Walmart is shifting its strategy. The company is building an online marketplace to house a variety of recently acquired brands that will largely maintain their independence from Walmart.

""Walmart is recognizing that to be successful in today's market, you're better off being a marketplace rather than an empire,"" Stephens said.

Walmart recently struck a deal to give the high-end department store chain Lord & Taylor space on its website. It has also been on an acquisition spree, snatching up ecommerce companies that appeal to higher-income customers like Jet, MooseJaw, ModCloth, Shoebuy, Bonobos, and Hayneedle.

Walmart ecommerce head Marc Lore explained the company's strategy of maintaining independence for these brands at a conference last month.

""Specialist positioning is better than mass,"" Lore said, according to TechCrunch. ""We’ve empowered the leaders of these companies to basically run the category across the entire entity.""

Walmart is preserving the independence of the brands it's acquiring at least in part to avoid alienating higher-income shoppers that might not otherwise shop at Walmart, said Ed Yruma, managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Internally, however, the brands will benefit from Walmart's cash flow, infrastructure, and relationships with suppliers.

""It doesn't need to be a Walmart box showing up on your doorstep,"" Yruma said, referring to shipments from one of Walmart's newly acquired ecommerce companies. ""The important piece though is that Walmart is leveraging the infrastructure and costs of these businesses across that broader platform.""","the

He has a lot of stories from working with boxing's biggest stars

One of his best stories is how he helped Mike Tyson avoid jail-time by arranging for him to do community service with children at Gleason's

As the owner of Gleason's Gym, arguably the world's most famous boxing gym, Bruce Silverglade has amassed a lot of stories.

Nearly every major boxer over the last half-century either learned how to box at Gleason's or trained there in advance of one fight or another. Legendary fighters like Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson — along with current boxing star Floyd Mayweather Jr. — have all trained at Gleason's.

Over the years, Silverglade has gotten to know nearly every fighter who has come through his doors. That includes Tyson, who grew up in New York City and spent a lot of time training at Gleason's throughout his career.

One of his most memorable stories about Tyson came after the often-troubled fighter was arrested in 2003 after getting into a fight with tourists in a Brooklyn hotel lobby in June 2003. Three tourists from Pennsylvania came into the lobby of the Marriott Hotel in Downtown Brooklyn after a night of partying and reportedly asked Tyson for an autograph. Tyson refused and a fight ensued.

Some reports said that the two men instigated the fight with Tyson, threatening him with a pole and suggesting they had a gun. Tyson was arrested on charges of assault and disorderly conduct.

The way Silverglade tells it, an investigator from the Brooklyn District Attorneys office called Silverglade asking him to convince Mike Tyson's team to talk to investigators. The DA's office, led at the time by Charles Hynes, a former amateur boxer, felt Tyson had gotten ""the short end of the stick,"" said Silverglade, but had to investigate the case due to Tyson's fame and his record.

""I told him that I’d talk to Mike’s team, but so long as we’re on the phone, why don’t you give community service? H e could do 100 hours at Gleason’s,"" Silverglade told Business Insider in a recent interview.

Hynes loved the idea, as did Tyson's attorney, Mel Sachs, who trained at Gleason's at the time. But Tyson turned it down because he felt admitting guilt would open him to a civil lawsuit, according to Silverglade.

Early the following year, Tyson agreed to a plea deal days before the trial was due to start. As part of the deal, the three misdemeanor charges against him would be dropped but he would plead guilty to disorderly conduct, a violation. In exchange, Tyson had to do 100 hours of community service working with children, primarily at Gleason's, and go through six months of counseling.

On the first day of Tyson's community service, he was only supposed to show up for 30 minutes to do some paperwork. He ended up staying for two hours to work with boxers in the gym's program for disadvantaged youths.

""The first day he was due to serve, there wasn’t a publication in the world that wasn’t here. Hynes was here for his photo-opp. Japanese cameras were here. European cameras,"" said Silverglade.

Coincidentally, Hilary Swank was also in the gym that day, training with legendary boxing trainer Hector Roca for her role in ""Million Dollar Baby."" Swank, according to Silverglade, was confused why the cameras were trained on Tyson and not her.

The plan for Tyson was to work with younger kids to teach them both how to box and about the difficult lessons he has learned through the severe highs and lows of his career.

Silverglade has long had the Give A Kid A Dream program, which offers at-risk youth the opportunity to learn how to box, providing them membership at Gleason's, instruction, and equipment.

''This is just terrific. This is the perfect way to give back to the community, to the kids, to Brooklyn,"" Hynes said at the time.","bruce silverglade

Celebrities in the entertainment and sports universe swiftly laid into Trump, who has been preoccupied with the ""Person of the Year"" title since before he launched his political career.



Sports and entertainment celebrities had a field day with President Donald Trump's claim about passing on being Time magazine's 2017 Person of the Year.

""Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named 'Man (Person) of the Year,' like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot,"" Trump tweeted on Friday. ""I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!""

Time disputed Trump's tweet, saying he was ""incorrect"" about its selection process for the award. ""TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6,"" the magazine said in a statement on Twitter.

As the controversy unfolded, prominent figures in the entertainment and sports industry weighed in to mock the president.

""Time Magazine called to say that I was DEFINITELY going to be named 'Man (Person) of the Year' but I would have to agree to leak major #Ep8 spoilers,"" tweeted ""Star Wars"" veteran Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy. ""I said 'no problem', but then they told me you turned it down and now I don't want it anymore. Thanks anyway!""

""Veep"" star Julia Louis-Dreyfus threw in her two cents as well.

"".@nytimes just called to say I was PROBABLY going to be named comedienne of the year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot,"" she tweeted. ""I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!""

Trump's tweet also drew scorn from Ava DuVernay, who directed ""Selma"" and the upcoming film, ""A Wrinkle In Time.""

""Nobody cares,"" DuVernay said in response to the president's claim.

Nobody cares. — Ava DuVernay (@ava) November 24, 2017

Sports icons like tennis star Andy Murray and New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard chimed in with their own takes.

Bbc just called to say I was PROBABLY going to be named sports personality of the year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! — Andy Murray (@andy_murray) November 24, 2017

Sports Illustrated called and said I was probably going to be Sportsman of the Year, but it was going to take a long photo shoot and interview. I’m not proud of my recent perm and have a interpretive dance class at the interview time so I turned it down! No Thanks SI!! — Noah Syndergaard (@Noahsyndergaard) November 25, 2017

Actor Jason Isaacs, who played Lucius Malfoy in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" and currently stars in ""Star Trek: Discovery,"" jabbed Trump by referencing special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing Russia investigation.

""The #MuellerInvestigation just called and said you were PROBABLY going to be named Soap Monitor on your wing and would have to agree to an interview and a perp picture with your combover shaved off,"" Isaacs tweeted. ""I said that's waaaay f------ good enough for me. #TimeToStartPacking.""

Conservative commentator and frequent Trump critic Bill Kristol also alluded to the investigation, tweeting that he didn't know who 2017's Time Person of the Year would be, but he hoped Mueller would get the honor in 2018.

I don’t know who’ll be Time’s 2017 Person of the Year, but I must say it would be nice if Robert Mueller turns out to be Time’s 2018 Person of the Year. — Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) November 25, 2017

Actor and comedian David Schneider lampooned the president as well.

Hollywood just called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named the next James Bond but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! — David Schneider (@davidschneider) November 24, 2017

Venerated author Joyce Carol Oates said her cat was slated to become TIME Magazine's ""Feline of the Year"" but declined to be interviewed because ""she is a cat.""

And Oscar winner Patricia Arquette wrote in response to Trump's tweet that he could just print himself ""another fake cover.""

You can always print yourself another fake cover. — Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) November 24, 2017

Trump's interest in TIME's cover predates his political ambitions

Arquette was likely referring to a Washington Post report which found that a framed copy of a fake Time magazine cover featuring Trump's photo hung in five of his luxury golf clubs.

""Donald Trump: The ‘Apprentice’ is a television smash!"" the headline on the fake cover read. There was another headline, written in all caps, above the TIME logo: ""TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV!""

""We couldn’t comment on the decor at Trump Golf clubs one way or another,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in response to the June report.

Trump's preoccupation with Time magazine and its ""Person of the Year"" award took root long before his political career took off.

""I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100...,"" he tweeted in 2012.

""The Time Magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People is a joke and stunt of a magazine that will, like Newsweek, soon be dead. Bad list!"" he tweeted in April 2013.

After throwing a slew of insults at the magazine between then and 2015, Trump praised it for including him on its cover in August 2015, as his presidential bid jumped to the top of the polls.

He later soured on the magazine, however, when it named German Chancellor Angela Merkel as its 2015 Person of the Year.

""I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite,"" he tweeted. ""They picked person who is ruining Germany.""

The magazine made it back into his good graces in early 2016, when he made the cover again, and later that year, when he was finally named Person of the Year after winning the November election.

""Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me ""Person of the Year"" - a great honor!"" he tweeted.","noah syndergaard noahsyndergaard

AP,Trump administration officials say they expect no trouble when President Trump's pick shows up for work,2017-11-25T19:22:39+00:00,cbs-news,Who's the boss come Monday at consumer agency?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whos-the-boss-come-monday-at-consumer-agency/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/25/6c0c04ac-e0e9-4467-b6e5-5bb30be6b00e/gettyimages-688228988.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Who's the boss? That's the awkward question after the departing head of a government agency charged with looking after consumers' rights appointed a deputy to temporarily fill his spot. The White House then named its own interim leader.

So come Monday, who will be leading what Congressional Republicans had called a ""rogue agency""?

Senior Trump administration officials said Saturday that they expect no trouble when President Donald Trump's pick for temporary director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau shows up for work, despite the clash on who should take over.

Mr. Trump called the agency a ""total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick"" in a tweet Saturday night. ""Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!""

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2017

Both departing director Richard Cordray -- an Obama appointee long criticized by Congressional Republicans as overzealous -- and the White House say they have the right to designate an interim leader until a permanent one is approved by Congress.

When Cordray tendered his resignation on Friday, he elevated Leandra English, who was the agency's chief of staff, into the deputy director position. Under the Dodd-Frank Act that created the CFPB, English would become acting director in Cordray's absence. Cordray specifically cited the law when he moved English, an ally of his, into that position.

That set up the battle with the White House, as Corday's move was clearly seen an attempt to stop Trump from shaping the agency in the months ahead. Getting a permanent replacement approved by the Senate could take months.

The president's pick for temporary appointee, Mick Mulvaney, had been widely anticipated. Mulvaney, currently director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been an outspoken critic of the agency and is expected to pull back on many of Cordray's actions in the six years since he was appointed.

Trump announced he was picking Mulvaney within a few hours of Cordray's announcement on Friday.

The administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House's thinking, called Trump's appointment of an acting director a ""routine move"" and cited the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, a different one than Cordray cited. They said the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has already approved Trump's appointment of Mulvaney and will issue a written legal opinion soon.

The clashing appointments raise the question of what happens when the two new heads show up and try to sit at the same desk and give orders?

One of the administrative officials, pressed about the awkward situation on Saturday, said she didn't anticipate Mulvaney would have any trouble when he started working Monday. Referring to Cordray's pick, the official added that English was expected to also show up, too -- but as deputy director.

The choice for a temporary appointment may seem a small matter, but the agency has been tangled in in partisan politics since its creation, and the attitudes of the two toward it differ sharply.

English is a trusted lieutenant of Cordray's who has helped investigate and punish financial companies in ways that many Republicans, Mulvaney in particular, think go too far. In his announcement Friday, Cordray praised English by highlighting her ""in-depth"" knowledge of the agency's operations and its staff. Before joining the CFPB, English served at the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management.

""Leandra is a seasoned professional who has spent her career of public service focused on promoting smooth and efficient operations,"" Cordray said in the statement.

Mulvaney was a South Carolina representative to the House before becoming head of the budget office. A founder of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, he was elected in 2010 as part of a tea party wave that brought many critics of the U.S. budget deficit to office. He has taken a hard line on federal spending matters, routinely voting against increasing the government's borrowing cap and pressing for major cuts to benefit programs as the path to balancing the budget.

He also has been unsparing in his criticism of the CFPB, and Democrats has seized upon his words in criticizing his appointment by Trump to the agency.

U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services committee, issued a statement Saturday calling Mulvaney ""unacceptable"" to lead the CFPB because of his ""noxious"" views toward its mission to protect consumers.

""As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Mulvaney called the Consumer Bureau a 'joke,'"" Waters wrote. ""He was also the original co-sponsor of a bill to completely eliminate the Consumer Bureau, and supported other legislation to harmfully roll back Wall Street reform.""","rogue agency senior trump administration

AP,Spending. Immigration. Taxes. It's a lot to complete.,2017-11-25T15:12:35+00:00,cbs-news,Congress has a daunting December to-do list,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-has-a-daunting-december-to-do-list/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/17/477e6a89-6386-48d2-893b-19a5933ec97d/cbsn-fusion-eyes-turn-to-senate-after-house-passes-gop-tax-plan-thumbnail-1443325-640x360.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The crush of unfinished business facing lawmakers when they return to the Capitol would be daunting even if Washington were functioning at peak efficiency.

It's an agenda whose core items — tax cuts, a potential government shutdown, lots of leftover spending bills — could unravel just as easily as advance amid factionalism, gamesmanship, and a toxic political environment.

There's only a four-week window until a Christmas deadline, barely enough time for complicated negotiations even if December stays on the rails. And that's hardly a sure bet in President Trump's capital.

Mr. Trump and congressional leaders plan a meeting Tuesday to discuss how to sidestep a shutdown and work though the legislative to-do list.

For the optimistic, it's plain that Democrats and Republicans have reasons to cooperate, particularly on spending increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies whose budgets otherwise would be frozen. An additional round of hurricane aid should be bipartisan, and efforts to reauthorize a popular health care program for children seem to be on track.

Republicans are advancing their cherished tax cut measure under special rules that mean Senate Democrats cannot use delaying tactics. The measure passed the House just before the Thanksgiving break and moves to the Senate floor this coming week.

After the Senate GOP's failure on health care this summer, the majority party is under enormous pressure to produce a victory on taxes. Still, GOP deficit hawks such as Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona remain uneasy about the overhaul.

While Democrats largely sidelined on taxes, they hold leverage over a mix of budget-related issues.

First, there's the need to avert a government shutdown after a temporary spending bill expires on Dec. 8. The most likely scenario, congressional aides say, is for an additional extension until Christmas. On a parallel track are talks to raise spending limits that are keeping agency budgets essentially frozen unless those caps are raised. If that happens, then negotiations could begin in earnest on a massive catchall spending measure in hopes of having it signed into law by year's end.

Taxes have gotten all the attention so far, but the showdown over a potential shutdown right before Christmas could soon take center stage. Democrats are counting on GOP fears of a holiday season closure to ensure Republican concessions during December talks.

Both sides would have to make concessions that may upset partisans in either party. Just as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., fears a revolt on the right, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California risks an uprising on her left. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., round out the quartet of top negotiators.

""Everybody's got complicated politics. The chance of short-term failure is pretty high — short-term failure being a shutdown,"" said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist. ""But the four of them, assuming they don't want to shut the government down for a long time, are going to have to come to an accommodation.""

Talks on the spending caps are stuck, however, aides say. A GOP offer to lift the Pentagon budget by more than $54 billion next year and non-defense limits by $37 billion was rejected by Democrats demanding balance between the two sides of the ledger.

Long-delayed battles over immigration and Mr. Trump's promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border are huge obstacles. Many Democrats whose votes are needed on the spending bills insist they won't vote for any legislation that includes the wall. Trump remains dead set on his $1.6 billion request for a down payment on the project.

Those same Democrats also insist that Congress must act by year's end to protect immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and whose protected status is set to lapse next year. Trump backs the idea despite issuing an executive order reversing the Obama administration protections, starting next spring. Conservatives oppose drawing in the immigration issue to legislation to keep the government running.

Hurricane relief is adding one more wrinkle.

Congress has approved more than $50 billion in aid in response to a series of devastating hurricanes. The most recent request by the White House is the largest yet at $44 billion, but it's not nearly enough to satisfy the powerful Texas delegation, which is pressing behind the scenes for more.

""Completely inadequate,"" said Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas. ""We must do far more to rebuild, repair and allow Texans to return to normal as quickly as possible.""

Trump is a huge wild card. He warmed to the idea of cutting deals with Democrats after a September pact with Schumer and Pelosi to lift the government's debt ceiling. He promised the Democratic leaders that he would sign legislation to give the young immigrants legal status — provided border security is addressed as well.

But Trump has not really engaged on the year-end agenda, and his impulsiveness could be a liability. He almost disowned an omnibus spending bill in May after media accounts portrayed the measure as a win for Democrats.","john culberson rtexas

""We are still in a stalemate,"" Gen. John Nicholson said in an interview airing on ""NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt"" Friday. ""We are only 90 days into this new policy, but with the U.S. forces that will be arriving, with the new authority that we have been given, put the pressure on external enablers, with the fact that we are condition based and not time based, we've set all the conditions to win.""

In late August, Mr. Trump delivered a major speech on America's longest war that offered few specific adjustments in U.S. strategy, and although that speech offered few specific details, it was soon followed by an increase of 3,000 troops. That increase brought the troop level to roughly 14,000.

Mr. Trump focused on the progress in Afghanistan in a videoconference with troops there on Thanksgiving from his club Mar-a-Lago in Florida, saying the military members on the ground ""turned it around over the last three to four months like nobody has ever seen.""

""And I have to say, just directly to the folks in Afghanistan, everybody is talking about the progress you've made in the last few months since I opened it open,"" Mr. Trump told the troops. ""We opened it up. We said go ahead, we're going to fight to win. We're not fighting anymore to just walk around. We're fighting to win. And you people are really -- you've turned it around over the last three to four months like nobody has seen. And they are talking about it. So, thank you very much -- brave, incredible fighters.""

Nicholson told NBC News he has the confidence of the president, and he has confidence in the president's strategy, which has given momentum to the U.S. and her allies.

""This change in policy has reversed this decline that we've been in since 2011,"" Nicholson told NBC News. ""And what I would say is that we've drawn down too far and too fast, we communicated to the enemy that we had lost our will to win, and now with a new policy as of August, we are going to win. And winning means delivering a negotiated settlement that reduces the level of violence and protecting the homeland.""

On Friday morning, Mr. Trump lamented U.S. involvement in the Middle East. He called it a ""mistake"" that the U.S. became involved in the first place, but promised to ""get it all done"" regardless.","afghanistan

More than 800 medical staffers have died in such attacks, which are considered war crimes. Dr. Attar, a Chicago-based orthopedic surgeon, volunteers for the Syrian-American Medical Society, which has supported over 400,000 surgeries during the 6-year conflict. Scott Pelley accompanies Dr. Samer on his fourth trip to the war zone for a 60 Minutes report to be broadcast Sunday, Nov. 26 at 7:30 p.m., ET and 7:00 p.m., PT.

Below is a transcript of a clip from the piece:

Emergency medicine has been driven underground. Every neighborhood airstrike delivers too many patients with too little time. Doctors improvise with scavenged drugs and salvaged equipment. So many doctors have been killed, or have fled, that veterinarians and dentists are pressed to do surgery.

Dr. Attar: You work with the understanding that you might find yourself dead, or crippled, or dismembered on the floor next to the people you're trying to save.

Dr. Samer Attar is a leading orthopedic surgeon from Chicago who volunteers in Syria's makeshift hospitals.

Dr. Attar: The bombs would land so close they'd knock you off your feet. And at times, they would directly hit the hospital. But all I did was look around and follow everyone else's lead because they're like rocks. They don't lose their cool, they don't lose their composure. They just keep working.

Dr. Attar enlisted in the Syrian-American Medical Society, which began in the 1990's as a professional association. But, since the revolution, these American doctors have raised nearly $100 million in aid and sent more than 100 members into rebel-held Syria, including Aleppo where Dr. Attar worked.

Dr. Attar: We'd find ourselves doing surgeries, sometimes without anesthesia, on people lying on gurneys in the hallway, because you're just so over-stretched.","syrianamerican medical

On Thursday the Navy ended the search for three men, now identified as Lt. Steven Combs of Florida, Airman Matthew Chialastri of Louisiana and Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso, also of Florida. Their families have all been notified.

U.S. Navy

Eight sailors were rescued about 40 minutes after the C-2A Greyhound crashed southeast of Okinawa and were transferred to the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier for medical evaluation. They are all in good condition.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these Sailors,"" U.S. Seventh Fleet commander Vice Adm. Phil Sawyer said in the Saturday statement identifying the three missing men. ""Their service and sacrifice will be lasting in Seventh Fleet and we will continue to stand the watch for them, as they did bravely for all of us.""

The twin-propeller plane came down about 500 nautical miles southeast of Okinawa as it was bringing passengers and cargo from Japan to the aircraft carrier, the Navy said in a statement. The cause wasn't clear and the crash was being investigated, the Navy said.

The USS Ronald Reagan led the combined search and rescue efforts with Japanese navy, the U.S. Navy said in a statement. During the course of the two-day search, eight U.S. Navy and Japanese navy ships, three helicopter squadrons and maritime patrol aircraft covered nearly 1,000 square nautical miles in the search for the missing sailors, the U.S. Navy said.

The Nov. 16-26 joint exercise in waters off Okinawa has been described by the Navy as the ""premier training event"" between the U.S. and Japanese navies, designed to increase defensive readiness and interoperability in air and sea operations.

The Navy's Japan-based 7th Fleet has had two fatal accidents in Asian waters this year, leaving 17 sailors dead and prompting the removal of eight top Navy officers from their posts, including the 7th Fleet commander.

The USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker collided near Singapore in August, leaving 10 U.S. sailors dead. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided off Japan.

The Navy has concluded that the collisions were avoidable and resulted from widespread failures by the crews and commanders, who didn't quickly recognize and respond to unfolding emergencies. A Navy report recommended numerous changes to address the problems, ranging from improved training to increasing sleep and stress management for sailors.","matthew chialastri

AP,27 kids among hundreds killed by gunmen who attacked Sufi Muslims -- sect often targeted by ISIS -- at Friday prayers,2017-11-25T13:40:16+00:00,cbs-news,Egypt mosque attack in Sinai Peninsula where ISIS present death toll jumps over 300,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egypt-mosque-attack-sinai-peninsula-isis-presence-death-toll-over-300/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/25/53793ac9-947c-4a7f-81ad-b2090ae05355/egypt-sinai-mosque-attack-878485068.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"ISMAILIA, Egypt -- Egypt on Saturday said an attack on a mosque by militants in the country's troubled region of northern Sinai has killed 305 worshippers, including 27 children, a dramatic increase in the death toll previously announced, which was 235.

A statement by the country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, said the attack Friday left another 128 people wounded.

It said the attackers, estimated at between 25 and 30, arrived at the mosque close to the small town of Bir al-Abd in five all-terrain vehicles and positioned themselves at the main door and the facility's 12 windows before opening fire. They also torched seven cars parked outside the mosque, which belonged to worshippers inside.

Quoting testimonies given to investigators by survivors, the statement said some of the attackers were masked. Those who were not sported heavy beards and long hair. The militants wore camouflaged pants and black T-shirts, it added.

Also on Saturday, Egyptian warplanes were in action over Sinai, according to the military, targeting several vehicles in which some of the culprits of the attack were traveling. All passengers of the vehicles were killed, it added. It was impossible to independently verify the claim since the media is virtually banned from working in Sinai.

The chief prosecutor's statement was the most detailed by authorities on the attack, the deadliest by Islamic extremists in Egypt's modern history. The account it gave generally agreed with what witnesses told The Associated Press on Saturday in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, where some of the wounded are hospitalized.

They spoke of horrific scenes during the approximately 20 minutes it took the militants to kill and maim worshippers. They spoke of some jumping out of windows, a stampede in a corridor leading to the washrooms and of children screaming in horror. Some spoke of their narrow escape from a certain death, others of families that lost all or most of their male members.

One witness, Ebid Salem Mansour, said the imam had barely made it atop the mosque pulpit to deliver the sermon when intense gunfire rang out. ""We knew that the mosque was under attack by (militants),"" he said, recounting an attack that constitutes a grim milestone in Egypt's brutal fight against increasingly emboldened militants.

Mansour, a 38-year-old worker in a nearby salt factory, said he settled in Bir al-Abd, the small town near where the attack took place, three years ago to escape the bloodshed and fighting elsewhere in northern Sinai. He suffered two gunshot wounds in the legs on Friday.

""Everyone lay down on the floor and kept their heads down. If you raised your head you get shot,"" he said. ""The shooting was random and hysterical at the beginning and then became more deliberate: Whoever they weren't sure was dead or still breathing was shot dead.""

The militants were shouting Allahu Akbar, or God is great, and the children were screaming, Mansour said.

""I knew I was injured but I was in a situation that was much scarier than being wounded. I was only seconds away from a certain death,"" he said. As the shooting took place, many of the worshippers recited their final prayers, he added.

Friday's attack targeted a mosque frequented by Sufis, members of a mystic movement within Islam. Islamic militants, including the local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), consider Sufis heretics because of their less literal interpretations of the faith.

Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt. The world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017

President Donald Trump condemned the ""cowardly"" attack on Twitter, and took the opportunity to tout the need for a border wall and travel ban, even though his most recent ban doesn't affect Egypt. He also said he would be speaking with Egypt's president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, later Friday.

Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi vowed that the attack ""will not go unpunished"" and that Egypt would persevere with its war on terrorism. As CBS News correspondent Charles D'Agata reports, only hours later Egyptian fighter jets were scrambled and carrying out airstrikes on alleged militant targets in Sinai.

On Saturday, el-Sissi ordered a mausoleum be built in memory of the victims of Friday's attack.

The military and security forces have already been waging a tough campaign against militants in the towns, villages and desert mountains of Sinai, and Egypt has been in a state of emergency since April. Across the country, thousands have been arrested in a crackdown on suspected Islamists as well as against other dissenters and critics, raising concern about human rights violations.

Seeking to spread the violence, militants over the past year have carried out deadly bombings on churches in the capital of Cairo and other cities, killing dozens of Christians. The ISIS affiliate is also believed to be behind the 2015 downing of a Russian passenger jet that killed 226 people over Sinai.

Friday's assault was the first major militant attack on a Muslim congregation in Egypt, and it eclipsed past attacks, even dating back to a previous Islamic militant insurgency in the 1990s.

Witnesses said worshippers began to jump out of windows as soon as the militants opened fire. ""The small door that leads to the corridor for the wash rooms was about the only one where worshippers rushed to escape,"" said a 38-year-old government employee who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation.

""There was a stampede. I fell down and then bodies piled up on top of me,"" he said.

No one claimed responsibility for the attack. But the ISIS affiliate in Sinai has targeted Sufis in the past.

Last year, the militants beheaded a leading local Sufi religious figure, the blind sheikh Suleiman Abu Heraz, and posted photos of the killing online. ISIS propaganda often denounces Sufis. In the January edition of an ISIS online magazine, a figure purporting to be a high level official in the Sinai affiliate of the group vowed to target Sufis, accusing them of idolatry and heretical ""innovation"" in religion and warning that the group will ""not permit (their) presence"" in Sinai or Egypt.

Millions of Egyptians belong to Sufi orders, which hold sessions of chanting and poetry meant to draw the faithful closer to God. Sufis also hold shrines containing the tombs of holy men in particular reverence.

Islamic militants stepped up their campaign of violence in northern Sinai after the military ousted the elected but divisive Islamist Mohammed Morsi from power in 2013 and launched a fierce crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood group.

The result has been a long, grinding conflict centered on el-Arish and nearby villages and towns. The militants have been unable to control territory, but the military and security forces have also been unable to bring security, as the extremists continuously carry out surprise attacks, mostly targeting outposts and convoys.

The attacks have largely focused on military and police, killing hundreds, although exact numbers are unclear. The militants have also assassinated individuals the group considers to be spies for the government or religious heretics. Egypt has also faced attacks by militants in its Western Desert.","donald j trump realdonaldtrump

Roy McClellan of Las Vegas was killed Nov. 17 while hitchhiking on State Route 160 in Pahrump, about 50 miles west of Las Vegas.

His widow, Denise McClellan, told KSNV-TV she can't understand why her 52-year-old husband survived the shooting, only to die in a hit-and-run. She says the mass shooting ""was messing with his head"" and that he was undergoing therapy.

""I'm angry. I feel that he was under the influence of something or drunk and didn't want to get caught, so he bailed and left my husband laying there in the street. He doesn't deserve that,"" McClellan told the station.

The Nevada Highway Patrol says it is seeking the driver of a Chevrolet Camaro with front-end damage.

Crimesider Staff,Kristina French and Logan Mott were reported missing Wednesday when they didn't pick up Mott's father from the airport,2017-11-24T22:43:04+00:00,cbs-news,Missing teen caught trying to enter Canada after body believed to be grandmother's found,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/logan-mott-missing-teen-caught-trying-to-enter-canada-after-body-believed-to-be-grandmothers-found/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/23/6b505989-452e-45e0-8e66-391fe3991cad/missing.png,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"NEPTUNE BEACH, Fla. -- Logan Mott, the 15-year-old from Florida who was reported missing earlier this week, was caught Friday night trying to enter Canada, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said.

Logan Mott has been detained by U.S. Customs and a Border as he tried to enter Canada from the Buffalo, NY area. A big thank you to everyone for sharing and helping us get #LoganMott detained quickly. pic.twitter.com/OHNXqGU9ap — Jax Sheriff's Office (@JSOPIO) November 25, 2017

Mott was reported missing with grandmother, but police said they believed they had found her body in a shallow grave in the backyard of her son's home.

Mott's mother Carrie Campbell-Mott released the following statement after learning her son was in custody, CBS affiliate WJAX reports: ""We are relieved he is safe and in custody and we just ask for everyone to give us time to sort out what happened. That no matter what, Logan is our child and we love him and are standing by him to help in any way. We want to find out what happened to Kristina and we need time for that to happen.""

On Wednesday, the teen and his grandmother were supposed to pick up his father and the father's girlfriend at the airport, who were flying back to the Jacksonville area after a vacation. When they didn't show up, the couple took an Uber back to their Neptune Beach home to find it ransacked with the door open and guns missing from a gun safe, CBS affiliate WJAX reports.

Neptune Beach Police and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, where Mott's father works as a corrections officer, launched an investigation. Jacksonville Sheriff's Office director Ron Lendvay said investigators uncovered evidence of foul play and ""possible criminal violence"" inside the home, and later uncovered the buried remains that appear to be consistent with Kristina French, 53. The remains have not been officially identified.

Lendvay said authorities are in the process of obtaining an arrest warrant for Mott on auto theft charges. He said police want to interview Mott to find out what happened in the home.

Mott had been the subject of a missing child alert issued by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. His mother Carrie Campbell-Mott had issued a plea for his return, telling media outlets he was insulin-dependent and didn't know whether he had his insulin with him.

Lendvay said investigators now believe he is in possession of his insulin packs.

Campbell-Mott, who lives in Missouri, told WJAX that Logan's father, who is her ex-husband and French's son, last heard from French via text on Tuesday when she confirmed she would pick him up at the airport the following day.

She the station that the last time she spoke to her son was Sunday night, and everything seemed fine.

Lendvay said that because guns were taken from the home, anyone who sees Mott or the car should use extreme caution and call 911. Mott should be considered armed and dangerous, he said.","florida department of law enforcement

The digital currency climbed above $8,700 to a record high Saturday following increased investor interest around the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and Black Friday shopping.

Bitcoin rose more than 6 percent to a record high of $8,725.13, according to CoinDesk, trading around $8,674 midday on Saturday. Another digital currency, ethereum, also hit an all-time high of $485.18, according to CoinMarketCap.

""The move appears to be retail driven,"" said Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor and CEO of BKCM, which runs a digital assets strategy.

The largest bitcoin exchange in the U.S., Coinbase, added about 100,000 accounts between Wednesday and Friday — just around Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday — to a total of 13.1 million. That's according to public data available on Coinbase's website and historical records compiled by Alistair Milne, co-founder and chief investment officer of Altana Digital Currency Fund. Coinbase had about 4.9 million users last November, Milne's data showed.

""Anecdotally, everyone I have talked to in the cryptocurrency community has said that Thanksgiving table discussion was all about bitcoin, and that inspired many family members to buy bitcoin,"" Kelly said. ""I suspect that pattern was repeated across tables everywhere.""

Bitcoin has multiplied more than eight times in value this year amid increased interest from institutional investors.

The world's largest futures exchange, CME, is planning to list bitcoin futures in the second week of December. The launch of a derivatives product for the digital currency will mark another step in establishing bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.

Already on Thanksgiving Day, throngs of shoppers were spotted across the country outside of places such as J.C. Penney, Macy's and Kohl's, hoping to snag limited doorbusters and other deep discounts on home goods, kitchen accessories and apparel.

That doesn't include the millions of shoppers who opted to ring up purchases from the convenience of their smartphones and computers. Adobe Insights, which measures 80 percent of online transactions at 100 major U.S. retailers, said a record $5.03 billion was spent online by the end of Black Friday, an increase of 17 percent from 2016.

""I think department stores had a reasonable time of it, better than last year,"" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders told CNBC.

GlobalData's preliminary tracking figures have already predicted total Black Friday sales to have risen the most since 2011. The National Retail Federation (NRF), the industry's trade group, is calling for an increase as much as 4 percent, with those results set to be released Tuesday afternoon.

Some of America's department stores, though, are already calling the day a victory.

""Black Friday sales and traffic have been very strong, both online and in store — well ahead of last year,"" Kohl's CEO Kevin Mansell said in a statement Friday evening.

The retailer said it delivered a ""record-breaking"" Thanksgiving, both in stores and online. More than 16 million visits were made to kohls.com, Kohl's said, outpacing any prior traffic or sales precedents.

Kohl's also said it fulfilled roughly 40 percent more orders that were bought online and picked up in stores, when compared with Black Friday of last year. Retailers across the industry have increasingly been touting the ability to do this, as it aims to save them money and save customers time.

Mansell told CNBC Friday morning that the biggest sellers for Kohl's this year were the Apple Watch, a Fitbit device and the Instant Pot, which was already sold out online. Nike and Under Amour merchandise was also selling at a rapid clip, he said.","national retail federation nrf

A permanent shift in spending could be more visible this holiday season, and economist Diane Swonk sees it coming at the expense of department stores.

""They can't seem to lure into the department stores those millennials,"" she said recently on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""The move from bricks to clicks, and the hybrid of the two is going to be a real problem.""

Swonk, who runs DS Economics, is concerned this retail area is seeing a permanent secular shift — even as a strong economy and record-breaking stock market are expected to motivate consumers to open their wallets wider this season.

According to a recent National Retail Federation survey, 39 percent of consumers between 25- and 34-years-old plan to spend more than last season, with nearly a quarter of those 18 to 24 also adding to their shopping lists.

The NRF finds young adults will be spending the majority of their money on apparel, electronics, books, music and video games. Their top destination: online shopping.

""The department stores are really being left behind,"" said Swonk. ""Overall, spending will do great this holiday season, but will it be enough to sort of stave off some bankruptcies going forward? I don't think so.""

Even though department stores are expected to face more challenges, there are other areas expected to see a big boost.

""Not only are we spending on homes again because they're worth investing in again ... people are finally catching up on all that pent-up demand and repairs and remodeling,"" she said.

Swonk is also seeing strength in vehicle sales and some clothing categories.

But she notes most consumers are shifting to experiences from things this season, particularly going out to dinners, bars and traveling.

She observes weekend rates at hotels in crowded cities are now exceeding weekday rates, which are typically high due to demand generated by business travelers.

""We're now seeing that much travel. That's even with Airbnb,"" Swonk added.","expense of department stores

CNBC,The U.S. president denounced the deadly mosque attack in Egypt and reached out to its president Friday.,2017-11-25T11:12:04Z,cnbc,Trump calls for crushing terrorists with military means,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/25/trump-calls-for-crushing-terrorists-with-military-means.html,//sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/staticcontent/img/cnbc_logo.gif,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"President Donald Trump denounced the deadly mosque attack in Egypt and reached out to its president, asserting the world must crush terrorists by military means — and insisting the U.S. needs a southern border wall and the travel ban tied up in courts.

""Need the WALL, need the BAN!"" Trump tweeted Friday before calling Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. ""God bless the people of Egypt.""

The attack's aftermath played out as Trump mixed work and play in sunny Florida, golfing — quickly, he claimed — with pros Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson, speaking with foreign leaders and tweeting briskly.

Trump spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before his attention turned to the attack in Egypt, where at least 235 people were killed when Islamic militants attacked a crowded mosque during prayers in the Sinai Peninsula, setting off explosives and spraying worshippers with gunfire.

""The world cannot tolerate terrorism,"" Trump tweeted in response. He added, ""We must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!""

In his call with el-Sissi, the White House said Trump condemned the attack and ""reiterated that the United States will continue to stand with Egypt in the face of terrorism.""

""The international community cannot tolerate barbaric terrorist groups and must strengthen its efforts to defeat terrorism and extremism in all its forms,"" the White House said.

Trump also used the attack to renew his call for a wall along the southern border with Mexico and his efforts to bar people from certain Muslim-majority countries from coming to the U.S.

""We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will,"" he wrote. ""Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt.""

Trump's original travel ban sought to temporarily suspend the U.S. refugee program and block the entry of nationals from seven majority-Muslim counties into the U.S. The order sparked chaos at airports and a flurry of lawsuits, which led to the order's suspension. The administration has since made several attempts to revise the order to try to better hold up to legal scrutiny.

Trump spent more than four hours at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, where he'd earlier tweeted that he would be playing ""golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson"" before returning to his private Mar-a-Lago club ""for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!""

Trump and his aides often appear concerned about the perception that he is vacationing during his trips away from the White House, insisting that he is partaking in high-level meetings and making calls while staying in Bedminster, New Jersey, or at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.

Despite plenty of photos posted on social media by club members, media traveling with the president were not permitted to observe or photograph the president and his companions on the greens.

In a break from the practice of past administrations, the Trump White House rarely discloses when the president is golfing, let alone whom he golfs with during frequent trips to courses he owns in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia.","abdelfattah elsissi god

President Trump on Friday named his budget director as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, moving to take control of the agency hours after its departing leader had taken steps to install his own choice for acting chief.

By the end of the night, an agency born of the financial meltdown — and one Republicans have tried to kill from the start — had dueling directors, and there was little sense of who actually would be in charge Monday morning.

The bureaucratic standoff began Friday afternoon when Richard Cordray, the Obama-appointed leader of the bureau, abruptly announced he would leave the job at the close of business, a week earlier than anticipated. He followed up with a letter naming his chief of staff, Leandra English, as the agency's deputy director.

The announcement came with a twist. Under the law, he said, that appointment would make the new deputy director the agency's acting director. The move was seen as an effort to delay Mr. Trump from appointing his own director, whose confirmation could take months.

The White House retaliated, saying that the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who once characterized the consumer protection bureau as a ""sad, sick joke,"" would be running the agency. He would also keep his current job as head of the Office of Management and Budget.

Mr. Mulvaney said he would assume the additional role until a permanent successor was found.

""I believe Americans deserve a C.F.P.B. that seeks to protect them while ensuring free and fair markets for all consumers,"" he said in a statement. ""Financial services are the engine of American democratic capitalism, and we need to let it work.""

In a letter to the consumer protection agency's staff, Mr. Cordray named Ms. English as deputy director. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the regulatory agency, the deputy director is to serve as acting director in the absence of a permanent leader, Mr. Cordray said.

The conflicting appointments were a fitting development for an agency under constant attack from Republican leaders, and it leaves supporters wondering about the agency's future with Mr. Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress.

The bureau was proposed in 2007 by Elizabeth Warren, then a Harvard law professor, but she was passed over to lead the agency after Obama administration officials became concerned that she would not be able to overcome resistance from Republicans during the confirmation process.

Instead, President Barack Obama chose Mr. Cordray, a former attorney general of Ohio whom Ms. Warren had picked to be the agency's enforcement director. But for two years, Republicans prevented the confirmation of a director to lead the agency. The agency's creation was also largely opposed by the banking industry, which sought to prevent Mr. Cordray's confirmation.

In July 2013, the Senate finally agreed to allow the confirmation of Mr. Cordray, cementing a new era of expansive federal oversight of companies that lend money to consumers.

The fight over the establishment of the protection bureau made Ms. Warren a political celebrity and helped her win a bid for Congress. Later, as a senator from Massachusetts, Ms. Warren has continued to champion the bureau, which has emerged as an aggressive consumer watchdog with broad power to combat financial abuses.

On Friday, Ms. Warren defended Mr. Cordray's decision on Facebook: ""President Trump can't override that. He can nominate the next CFPB Director — but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act.""

Consumer groups quickly praised Mr. Cordray, whose move appeared to be a final attempt to keep the bureau in hands that would preserve the legacy he helped create as its first director.

""Fortunately, the statute creating the C.F.P.B. says that the agency's deputy director serves as acting director until a new director has been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate,"" Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, said in a statement. ""Mulvaney has said he is opposed to the very existence of the C.F.P.B., and as a member of Congress he voted in favor of Wall Street banks and predatory lenders — his largest donors — again and again.""

The appointment of Mr. Mulvaney, who as a Republican congressman from South Carolina was a co-sponsor of legislation to shut down the consumer bureau, had been widely anticipated. The White House said in a statement on Friday that President Trump looked forward to seeing Mr. Mulvaney take a ""common sense approach"" to leading the bureau's staff.","american democratic

The Associated Press,"Militants killed 305 worshippers, a dramatic increase in the death toll previously announced.",2017-11-25T12:56:57Z,cnbc,Egypt raises death toll in Sinai mosque attack to 305,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/25/egypt-raises-death-toll-in-sinai-mosque-attack-to-305.html,https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/11/25/104862249-GettyImages-878514556.1910x1000.jpg,business,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Egypt on Saturday said an attack on a mosque by militants in the country's troubled region of northern Sinai has killed 305 worshippers, including 27 children, a dramatic increase in the death toll previously announced, which was 235.

A statement by the country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, said the attack Friday left another 128 people wounded.

It said the attackers, estimated at between 25 and 30, arrived at the mosque close to the small town of Bir al-Abd in five all-terrain vehicles and positioned themselves at the main door and the facility's 12 windows before opening fire. They also torched seven cars parked outside the mosque, which belonged to worshippers inside.

Quoting testimonies given to investigators by survivors, the statement said some of the attackers were masked. Those who were not sported heavy beards and long hair. The militants wore camouflaged pants and black T-shirts, it added.

Also on Saturday, Egyptian warplanes were in action over Sinai, according to the military, targeting several vehicles in which some of the culprits of the attack were traveling. All passengers of the vehicles were killed, it added. It was impossible to independently verify the claim since the media is virtually banned from working in Sinai.

The chief prosecutor's statement was the most detailed by authorities on the attack, the deadliest by Islamic extremists in Egypt's modern history. The account it gave generally agreed with what witnesses told The Associated Press on Saturday in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, where some of the wounded are hospitalized.

They spoke of horrific scenes during the approximately 20 minutes it took the militants to kill and maim worshippers. They spoke of some jumping out of windows, a stampede in a corridor leading to the washrooms and of children screaming in horror. Some spoke of their narrow escape from a certain death, others of families that lost all or most of their male members.

One witness, Ebid Salem Mansour, said the imam had barely made it atop the mosque pulpit to deliver the sermon when intense gunfire rang out. ""We knew that the mosque was under attack by (militants),"" he said, recounting an attack that constitutes a grim milestone in Egypt's brutal fight against increasingly emboldened militants.

Mansour, a 38-year-old worker in a nearby salt factory, said he settled in Bir al-Abd, the small town near where the attack took place, three years ago to escape the bloodshed and fighting elsewhere in northern Sinai. He suffered two gunshot wounds in the legs on Friday.

""Everyone layed down on the floor and kept their heads down. If you raised your head you get shot,"" he said. ""The shooting was random and hysterical at the beginning and then became more deliberate: Whoever they weren't sure was dead or still breathing was shot dead.""

The militants were shouting Allahu Akbar, or God is great, and the children were screaming, Mansour said.

""I knew I was injured but I was in a situation that was much scarier than being wounded. I was only seconds away from a certain death,"" he said. As the shooting took place, many of the worshippers recited their final prayers, he added.

Friday's attack targeted a mosque frequented by Sufis, members of a mystic movement within Islam. Islamic militants, including the local affiliate of the Islamic State group, consider Sufis heretics because of their less literal interpretations of the faith.

President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi vowed that the attack ""will not go unpunished"" and that Egypt would persevere with its war on terrorism. But he did not specify what new steps might be taken. On Saturday, he ordered that a mausoleum be built in memory of the victims of Friday's attack.

The military and security forces have already been waging a tough campaign against militants in the towns, villages and desert mountains of Sinai, and Egypt has been in a state of emergency since April. Across the country, thousands have been arrested in a crackdown on suspected Islamists as well as against other dissenters and critics, raising concern about human rights violations.

Seeking to spread the violence, militants over the past year have carried out deadly bombings on churches in the capital of Cairo and other cities, killing dozens of Christians. The IS affiliate is also believed to be behind the 2016 downing of a Russian passenger jet that killed 226 people over Sinai.

Friday's assault was the first major militant attack on a Muslim congregation, and it eclipsed past attacks, even dating back to a previous Islamic militant insurgency in the 1990s.

The militants, according to another witness, said worshippers began to jump out of windows as soon as the militants opened fire. ""The small door that leads to the corridor for the wash rooms was about the only one where worshippers rushed to escape,"" said a 38-year-old government employee who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation.

""There was a stampede. I fell down and then bodies piled up on top of me,"" he said

No one claimed responsibility for the attack. But the IS group affiliate has targeted Sufis in the past.

Last year, the militants beheaded a leading local Sufi religious figure, the blind sheikh Suleiman Abu Heraz, and posted photos of the killing online. Islamic State group propaganda often denounces Sufis. In the January edition of an IS online magazine, a figure purporting to be a high level official in the Sinai affiliate of the group vowed to target Sufis, accusing them of idolatry and heretical ""innovation"" in religion and warning that the group will ""not permit (their) presence"" in Sinai or Egypt.

Millions of Egyptians belong to Sufi orders, which hold sessions of chanting and poetry meant to draw the faithful closer to God. Sufis also hold shrines containing the tombs of holy men in particular reverence.

Islamic militants stepped up their campaign of violence in northern Sinai after the military ousted the elected but divisive Islamist Mohammed Morsi from power in 2013 and launched a fierce crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood group.

The result has been a long, grinding conflict centered on el-Arish and nearby villages and towns. The militants have been unable to control territory, but the military and security forces have also been unable to bring security, as the extremists continuously carry out surprise attacks, mostly targeting outposts and convoys.

The attacks have largely focused on military and police, killing hundreds, although exact numbers are unclear. The militants have also assassinated individuals the group considers to be spies for the government or religious heretics. Egypt has also faced attacks by militants in its Western Desert.","abdelfattah elsissi

""As you get older, there are only so many things you want to concentrate on. Apartment life lets you focus on things that matter and get rid of stuff that takes up a lot of time,"" said Chung. His building's concierge signs for his packages, and arranges for housecleaning.

Chung is one example of a subset of baby boomers who have become the fastest-growing group of renters across the nation. Since they tend to have more money to spend than their millennial counterparts, developers are actively figuring out how to lure them to into one of the luxury buildings sprouting up across the city.

Both boomers and millennials are flocking to areas like downtown Brooklyn, where a flurry of new full-services high-rises are springing up — and they sometimes compete over units, Citi Habitats agent Jason Burke told CNBC.

According to Burke, even though there is a glut of these new apartments, there is only a limited amount in certain price ranges. Most people want to get in first when the developers are offering the best discounts, he said.

""The boomers are the biggest demographic that can afford it,"" he said. ""But tech levels everything. We're seeing a lot of engineers come to New York, a lot of people in tech who don't work from an office.""","administrator

Black Friday used to be the undisputed king of shopping days, but according to the National Retail Federation, the day after Thanksgiving is only the start of a consumer buying bonanza that lasts until Christmas. That weeks-long stretch brings in between 30 to 40 percent of all annual retail sales, the NRF states, and this year holiday retail sales are expected to surge between 3-4 percent, up from $655.8 billion last year.

According to retail expert Jan Kniffen, the boost to retail sales will be even more pronounced, thanks to online buying. ""Online is going to grow 20 percent this year in the holiday season,"" Kniffen predicted to CNBC's ""On the Money"" in an interview.

""But in the battle for your holiday retail dollar, when will online buying overtake in-store sales?"" he asked. ""That has to happen, because we're gradually going to be 50 percent online (sales) in this country,"" Kniffen added.

Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggested mobile sales set a new record on Friday, data from Adobe Insights showed.

Part of the reason could be disenchantment with the spectacle of Black Friday, which has begun encroaching on Thanksgiving proper.

""Even before stores were open all kinds of crazy hours and round-the-clock hours over the Thanksgiving weekend, Black Friday was always your highest traffic day, but it was frequently not your highest sales day,"" Kniffen told CNBC.

He said families shopped all day, ""…so there were lots of people going through your store. It was the original beginning, I think of 'showrooming',"" Kniffen said. ""They all came in and looked at the stuff but they came back and bought it later; now that happens online.""

While ""brick and mortar [retail] is a much bigger business…we have reached the tipping point"" he said, as in-store purchases defy steep discounts and foot traffic falters. Kniffen noted that in the fourth quarter of last year during the holiday shopping season, ""traffic was down 8 or 9 percent in the enclosed malls and we saw growth online of almost 20 percent.""

It's an unsustainable dynamic, he explained. ""Because it's really hard to run your expense structure when you're not getting growth in the stores.""","federation

"Elizabeth Landers, CNN","The White House on Saturday vehemently defended President Donald Trump's decision to appoint Mick Mulvaney as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, calling it a ""typical, routine move.""",2017-11-25T15:40:44Z,cnn,White House defends Mulvaney's appointment to CFPB,http://us.cnn.com/2017/11/25/politics/white-house-cfpb-mulvaney/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171125082353-trump-mulvaney-cordray-split-super-tease.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"(CNN) President Donald Trump slammed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its former director Saturday, calling the consumer watchdog ""a total disaster"" just hours after senior administration officials defended his decision to appoint Mick Mulvaney as its acting head.

""The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick,"" Trump tweeted. ""Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!""

Check out the recent Editorial in the Wall Street Journal @WSJ about what a complete disaster the @CFPB has been under its leader from previous Administration, who just quit!

On Saturday morning, the White House vehemently defended Trump's choice of Mulvaney, the current head of the Office of Management and Budget, as the consumer agency's acting director, calling it a ""typical, routine move.""

""We think that this move is clearly supported by a plain reading of the Vacancies' Act,"" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters, referring to the presidential appointment authorities outlined in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. ""The Vacancy Act is a long-established, used by presidents of both parties as a routine function, and we believe this act is consistent with that long-established practice.""

Trump's decision Friday to name Mulvaney as acting director of the consumer watchdog agency came hours after the outgoing director, Richard Cordray, appointed his own successor, sparking confusion and signaling a potential showdown over who's in charge of the agency.

In a tweet Friday night, Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, an architect of the consumer agency, said that under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the agency's deputy director assumes the role of acting director if there's a vacancy. Cordray named his chief of staff, Leandra English, as deputy director, which essentially establishes her as the bureau's acting director.

Trump ""can't override that,"" Warren tweeted. The President ""can nominate the next director -- but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act,"" she tweeted.

Warren added in a tweet on Saturday that the issue needed to be decided in the courts.

""If @realDonaldTrump believes he is acting legally by ignoring Dodd-Frank, he should go to court & seek a judgment right away to settle this @CFPB dispute,"" she wrote.

A second administration official told reporters Saturday that Trump's choice of Mulvaney supersedes the Dodd-Frank statute, which the official called a ""default.""

In addition, the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel signed off on Mulvaney's appointment and will publish an opinion on the approval, the official said.

It remains unclear whether Mulvaney would be a permanent appointee to the position, which he said he would hold in addition to his role as the head of the Office of Management and Budget. The administration officials said the President would name a permanent head of the agency ""in the upcoming weeks,"" but they would not preview who that pick would be, saying that Trump has not yet made a decision.

A source close to Mulvaney said it was ""not likely"" that he would be chosen as the permanent head of the consumer watchdog agency. The job Mulvaney loves most of all in the administration is his position at the Office of Management and Budget, and it was never envisioned that he would lead the consumer agency permanently, the source said.

The administration officials said they expect English to start serving as Mulvaney's deputy on Monday. The administration is ""hoping"" there won't be a legal challenge to Mulvaney's appointment, citing the President's authority to choose him for the post, the first official said. But they are ready to fight for the appointment.

""We have gone out of our way to avoid an unnecessary legal battle with Mr. Cordray,"" the official said. ""His actions clearly indicate that he is trying to provoke one.""

While serving in Congress, Mulvaney voted in favor of killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , which was created after the financial crisis to protect consumers and keep an eye on Wall Street.

Mulvaney and other opponents have argued that the agency has too much power, saying it installs unduly harsh regulations. He has worked alongside Trump to roll back some of the consumer agency's rules.

In his exit letter, Cordray said the consumer agency's work is vital to the US economy.

Proponents of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau say it plays a key role in preventing big business from preying on the little guy.

""We have returned almost $12 billion to more than 30 million consumers who had been cheated or mistreated by banks or other large financial companies,"" Cordray wrote in the letter.

Obama angered Republicans when he installed Cordray in 2012 while the Senate was in recess, but the Senate confirmed him for a full five-year term in 2013.","department of justices office of legal counsel

That's not really surprising. The two are inextricably connected. In fact, the agency was her idea.

Critics say the CFPB, which has forced misbehaving banks to return more than $12 billion to consumers, is the epitome of government overreach and wields too much unchecked power. Warren and other proponents argue it's a key watchdog agency working for American consumers.

The years-long fight over the CFPB reached a boiling point on Friday night when director Richard Cordray resigned and named his chief of staff, Leandra English, as deputy director. That move teed her up to take over as the bureau's acting director per the rules of the agency established under 2010's Dodd-Frank act.

Trump subsequently announced that Mick Mulvaney, the current director of the Office of Management and Budget, would be acting director of the consumer watchdog agency.

Related: Cordray resignation sets off scramble over Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

That set up a showdown over who's in charge of the agency, and Warren was having none of it.

The senator from Massachusetts tweeted Friday that there is no confusion.

The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a @CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. @realDonaldTrump can't override that. pic.twitter.com/r949ccaJAb — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) November 25, 2017

The president ""can nominate the next @CFPB Director - but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act.""

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act is a massive post-recession reform law. The act included provisions to establish the CFPB.

The idea was birthed in a paper Warren wrote in 2007 while she was a law professor at Harvard. She moved to Washington after Dodd-Frank passed to help then-President Obama get CFPB up and running. She touted it as a tool to protect average people from banks behaving badly.

The agency hit a leadership scuffle right off the bat. Obama considered naming Warren to direct the agency, but it became clear that corporate players and Republicans on the Hill wouldn't have it. They feared she'd be too zealous a leader.

So Obama tapped Cordray, but even he was forced to lead the agency as ""acting director"" because Republicans in the Senate blocked his formal confirmation. By the time they greenlit his appointment, in 2013, it was a largely symbolic move.

Since then, the CFPB has proved hungry to take on big banks, shady payday lenders and everything in between. In the wake of Wells Fargo's fake account scandal, for example, CFPB ordered the bank to pay a $185 million fine and dole out $5 million in customer refunds. The agency also maintains a public database of complaints against financial companies.

Related: White House defends Mulvaney's appointment to CFPB

Wall Street and most Republicans loathe the agency, and they see Cordray's resignation as chance to remake it.

Republicans argue it's a ""rogue"" agency because it's not funded by Congress, and it's run by a single director who can't be fired by the president at will. (Those provisions have prompted one federal court to rule the CFPB ""unconstitutionally structured."")

In February, just after Trump's inauguration, Republicans declared all-out war on the CFPB, and introduced legislation to dismantle it.

""The CFPB has eroded freedom, trampled due process and killed jobs. It must go,"" Chairman of the House Financial Services committee Jeb Hensarling wrote in a February op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.

The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group that represents retail banks, said in a statement Saturday that ""the CFPB's current governing structure is a dictatorship, period.""

And the White House's move Friday to install Mulvaney, who worked to kill the agency while he served in Congress, signals Republicans are still out to dismantle it.

However, confusion still reigns about who's actually in charge.

Related: Trump kills rule that made it easier for people to sue banks

The White House doubled down on its declaration that Mulvaney is the rightful acting director during a conference call with reporters on Saturday. An official argued it's a ""typical, routine"" course of action for a president to fill such vacancies.

Mulvaney, who once called the CFPB a ""sick, sad joke,"" said in a statement Saturday that he will ensure CFPB works to ""protect [Americans] while ensuring free and fair markets for all consumers.""

""I look forward to working with the expert personnel within the agency to identify how the Bureau can transition to be more effective in its mission, while becoming more accountable to the taxpayer,"" he said.

For its part, the CFPB has been mum since Cordray resigned on Friday night.

One thing is certain: Trump does have the authority to nominate a permanent leader for the CFPB.

But the nominee will need to be confirmed by the Senate -- where he or she will undoubtedly face a grilling from Warren. And Warren has proven her willingness to hold up Trump appointees for months on end.","wall street journal the consumer bankers association

Barney Frank pushed back Saturday on the White House's assertion that President Donald Trump has the authority to appoint an interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying the independence of watchdog agency was a key consideration when Congress passed the law to create it in 2010.

""We gave a lot of attention to how to structure the CFPB and how to protect its independence, because its job is to go after some very powerful forces in the economy,"" the Massachusetts Democrat, who authored the law with then-Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd, told CNN in an interview. He added: ""The point is, we intend what [former CFPB Director Richard] Cordray was doing to have this kind of autonomy.""

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law designated that the watchdog's deputy director would serve as acting director in the event of a vacancy specifically to give the agency independence from the White House, Frank said. When Cordray resigned Friday, he appointed the agency's chief of staff, Leandra English, to serve as its deputy director, teeing her up to take over as the bureau's acting director.

But hours after Cordray tendered his resignation, the White House announced that Trump had chosen Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to serve as acting director, setting off a possible legal fight over the leadership of the agency.

""Director Mulvaney will serve as acting director until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed,"" the White House said in a statement Friday.

Jackie Wattles,Online shoppers spent $5 billion on Black Friday -- 17% more than last year.,2017-11-25T05:08:05Z,cnn,Online sales boomed on Black Friday,http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/25/news/black-friday-holiday-shopping-foot-traffic/index.html,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171125170446-black-friday-2017-780x439.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Black Friday 2017 was all about digital sales.

American shoppers spent a record $5 billion in 24 hours. That marks a 16.9% increase in dollars spent online compared with Black Friday 2016, according to data from Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks 80% of online spending at America's 100 largest retail websites.

Digital retail giant Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) said Friday that orders were rolling in ""at record levels."" More than 200,000 toys were sold in just the first five hours of the day, the company said. Amazon did not provide sales figures for Black Friday.

Meanwhile, malls and big-box retailers were left only slightly emptier.

Early estimates from ShopperTrak, a data analytics company that measures the number of shoppers at stores, said foot traffic ""decreased less than one percent when compared to Black Friday 2016.""

A meager dip is good news for traditional retailers. As online-savvy businesses continue to gobble up more and more of the market share, companies like Macy's (M), JCPenney (JCP), Gap (GPS) and Sears (SHLD) have suffered.

It remains to be seen exactly how much in-store shoppers were willing to spend. That will be a crucial data point in assessing retailers' woes.

Related: Is this the last Black Friday?

But Brian Field, senior director of advisory services for ShopperTrak, is optimistic.

""There has been a significant amount of debate surrounding the shifting importance of brick-and-mortar retail, and the fact that shopper visits remained intact on Black Friday illustrates that physical retail is still highly relevant and, when done right, profitable,"" Field said in a statement.

Looking at both Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, however, in-store foot traffic was actually down nearly 2% compared to the same two days last year.

Field says that's likely because ""a greater number of brick-and-mortar retailers opted to close on Thanksgiving Day.""

We'll know more about how it all shakes out in the coming months and early 2018, when big-box retailers post their next round of earnings reports.

In the meantime, there's plenty of busy holiday shopping days to come.

Adobe predicts that Cyber Monday will be even bigger than Black Friday, bringing in as much as $6 billion in digital sales.","bigbox retailers post

Bezos, the founder and largest shareholder of Amazon, reached the 12-digit milestone for the first time, according to Bloomberg, one of the two major services that track the real-time net worth of the world's richest people.

Forbes, the other service, shows him just scraping by, with $99.6 billion to his name.

Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) stock climbed 2.5% on Friday to put Bezos over the top. The stock got a lift from reports that online shopping on Thanksgiving and Black Friday jumped 18% compared with last year. Bezos made almost $2.4 billion on Friday alone.

Related: Jeff Bezos just sold $1.1 billion worth of Amazon stock

Bezos owns 78.9 million shares of Amazon, worth $93.6 billion. That doesn't account for all his holdings, although the two other highest-profile companies he owns -- The Washington Post and space tourism company Blue Origin -- don't move the needle much by comparison.

Related: Jeff Bezos is the smartest guy in business

Amazon shares are up 58% this year, enough to enrich Bezos by about $34 billion. In fact, his single-day gain of $2.4 billion would be enough by itself to get him into Forbes' list of the 1,000 richest people on the planet.

Bezos grabbed the title of world's richest person in July, when he briefly passed Bill Gates. He moved back ahead of Gates in October. The Microsoft founder is now worth a mere $89 billion, according to Forbes and Bloomberg.

Gates is believed to be the only other person to reach $100 billion. That was in 1999, when the internet stock bubble briefly put him over the mark.","congratulations

Please do not put yourself in danger.

(CNN) The death toll in a bomb and gun attack on a Sufi mosque in northern Sinai has risen to 305, with 27 children among the dead, Egypt's state prosecutor said Saturday.

Another 128 people were wounded, according to a statement from the public prosecutor read out on Egyptian state-run news channel Nile TV.

Between 25 and 30 armed men carried out the assault on the al Rawdah Sufi mosque in Bir al-Abed, the statement said.

The prosecutor also gave more detail about how the brutal attack unfolded. The attackers arrived in five SUVs and were armed with automatic machine guns, the statement said. They took position in front of the mosque and its entrances.

Survivors of the incident now at the hospital described massive gunfire and loud explosions at the start of the attack. A number of attackers, some of them masked, then entered the mosque, the statement said.

The attackers had long beards and hair, were wearing military fatigues and were armed with heavy machine guns, according to the statement. At least one of those who entered the mosque was carrying an ISIS flag, it said.

There has not yet been a claim of responsibility from ISIS or its affiliate in Egypt. However, the attack bears the hallmarks of a strike by ISIS, which maintains a foothold in the north of the Sinai Peninsula and inspires local Islamist extremist groups, despite the efforts of Egyptian security forces.

Victims are seen on the floor of al Rawdah mosque following the gun and bomb attack Friday.

President vows 'brute force'

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi vowed to respond to the massacre -- believed to be the deadliest terrorist attack on the country's soil -- with ""brute force.""

Egyptian warplanes conducted airstrikes on ""terrorist outposts"" and vehicles following the attack, the military said Saturday.

""The Egyptian Air Force pursued the terrorist elements, discovered and destroyed a number of vehicles that carried out the brutal terrorist killings, and killed all terrorists inside those vehicles,"" military spokesman Tamer Rifai said in a statement Saturday.

It also targeted a number of terrorist outposts containing weapons, ammunition and radical elements, Rifai said.

A teenage survivor of the attack is treated Friday at a hospital in Ismailia.

Al Rawdah mosque is known as the birthplace of an important Sufi cleric. Sufism is a mystical branch of Islam that some jihadists consider heretical.

Witnesses told CNN that the attack started when an explosive device went off in a building adjacent to the mosque and that gunmen fired at worshippers as they fled. Gunmen then entered the mosque and fired at those inside, they said.

The attackers had also set up ""ambush"" locations and opened fire on ambulances as they transported the wounded to al-Arish before the arrival of security services, according to witnesses.

Photos from inside the mosque showed what appeared to be bodies lined up in rows on the carpet.

'No one got out of the mosque'

One survivor, who asked that his name not be used, told CNN on Saturday that he still had shrapnel in an eye that was covered by a bandage. Sitting with tribesmen outside a hospital emergency room, he said he believes he survived because he was covered by the bodies of other victims as the attackers went around the mosque to ensure everyone was dead.

""No one got out of the mosque,"" said another witness at a nearby hospital. The man, who also declined to be identified out of fear of retaliation, said his father and eight other family members, including a brother and nephew, were killed.

The man said soldiers from a nearby military unit must have heard the gunfire during the attack but did not immediately respond.

""Even the ambulances came under fire."" he said.

A man nearby nodded in agreement. Moments later, hospital volunteers alerted a military officer protecting the hospital -- who asked reporters to leave.

Another man told CNN he drove one of the first ambulances to the scene but turned around after shots were fired at the vehicle. Ambulances from al-Arish managed to reach the mosque only after security forces secured the road, he said.

The attackers used automatic weapons, said Diaa Rashwan, the chairman of the state information service. Some victims were also killed by the explosions.

National mourning declared

In a short, televised speech after meeting with security officials, Sisi said the government would hunt down the attackers.

""We will respond to this act with brute force against these terrorists,"" he said. ""This terrorist act will strengthen our resolve, steadfastness and will to stand up to, resist and battle against terrorism.""

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, center, meets with officials in Cairo after the mosque attack.

Three days of national mourning have been declared. Sisi has also ordered the armed forces to build a memorial to those killed at the mosque, a statement on his official Facebook page said.

The grand imam of Al-Azhar, the premier religious authority in Egypt, condemned the ""barbaric attack"" on the mosque.

""The shedding of blood, the violation of the sacred houses of God and the terrorizing of worshippers are acts of corruption on the earth,"" Ahmed El-Tayyeb said.

The targeting of mosques followed an attack on churches , El-Tayyeb said, adding that Egyptians would prevail over terrorism with solidarity and determination.

People gather at the site of the mosque attack on Friday.

Northern Sinai unrest

Friday's attack prompted wide international condemnation, with US President Donald Trump among the leaders expressing condolences and vowing to continue the fight against terrorism.

Sisi expressed concern recently that ISIS militants fleeing Iraq and Syria would come to Egypt.

Egyptian security forces face almost daily attacks from militants with ISIS ties in northern Sinai.

The Wilayat Sinai group, which pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014, has been behind numerous attacks and hundreds of deaths in the desert region.

It claimed responsibility for the bombing of a Russian passenger jet that crashed in October 2015 in the Sinai Peninsula, killing 224 people

Relatives of the victims of the mosque attack sit outside a hospital Saturday in the eastern port city of Ismailia.

If it turns out ISIS militants are behind the latest attack, ""it reflects their willingness to continue to do large operations that have large civilian casualties,"" Timothy Kaldas, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told CNN.

There would be two plausible motives for an ISIS attack, he said. First, ISIS considers Sufis to be heretics, making the Sufi mosque a legitimate target in the eyes of ISIS, even though all worshippers probably weren't Sufi.

Second, Kaldas said, ISIS may be taking revenge against members of the Sawarkah tribe, to which most of the people in the area belong, because it has been cooperating with the Egyptian government in its campaign against Wilayat Sinai.","news channel nile tv between

Steven Combs, Aviation Boatswain's Mate Airman Matthew Chialastri and Aviation Ordnanceman Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso.

The Navy ended the search and rescue mission for the sailors on Thursday. They were aboard a C2-A Greyhound transport plane that crashed into the ocean southeast of Okinawa a day earlier.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these Sailors,"" Vice Adm. Phil Sawyer, commander of U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in a statement. ""Their service and sacrifice will be lasting in Seventh Fleet and we will continue to stand the watch for them, as they did bravely for all of us.""

A total of 11 crew and passengers were headed to an aircraft carrier when the plane crashed into the Philippine Wednesday afternoon, the Navy said.

Eight people were rescued and were in good condition aboard the carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, the Navy said.

Combs, a native of Florida, was assigned to the ""Providers"" of Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VRC) 30, the Navy said. Chialastri, a Louisiana native, was assigned to Ronald Reagan, as was Grosso, a Florida native.

The aircraft was carrying passengers and cargo from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan to the carrier when the plane crashed about 500 nautical miles southeast of Okinawa, Japan.

A C-2A Greyhound plane launches from the USS Ronald Reagan during a 2017 exercise.

Seven US Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ships, three helicopter squadrons and maritime patrol aircraft covered nearly 1,000 square nautical miles in the search.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.

""I have been informed from the US military that engine trouble may have caused (the crash),"" Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told reporters Wednesday.

The C2-A that crashed belongs to a Japan-based squadron that generally flies cargo and passengers between shore bases and the USS Ronald Reagan.

It's been a difficult year for the Navy in the western North Pacific after a spate of incidents -- most involving ships assigned to the East Asia-based US 7th fleet -- that included the deaths of 17 sailors.","the

(CNN) A woman walking her dogs near her western New York home was fatally shot Wednesday by a man who told police he mistook her for a deer.

Rosemary Billquist, 43, was hit by a bullet from a single-shot pistol fired by neighbor Thomas B. Jadlowski, said Sgt. Josh Ostrander of the Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office.

Jadlowski told investigators he was 200 yards from the victim when he fired.

When Jadlowski realized his grave mistake, he called 911.

I burned through the Pixel Buds' batteries twice because my neck had un-paused Spotify without me noticing, leaving my screwed for the commutes home. The fact that this happened twice is surprising if only because of the Buds' battery life — in general, they last between four to five hours on a charge,

Of course, the Pixel Buds mainly exist as a vessel for Google's Assistant. You access it by saying -- what else? -- ""OK, Google"" or by holding your finger against the right earbud, but the tell-tale Assistant bloop only happens when you do the former. It should really happen when you press the earbud, too, if only to make absolutely clear when the Assistant has actually started listening for a command.

Once you get the hang of things, the experience of talking to Google Assistant through the buds is mostly identical to using it on your phone or through a Google Home. That's often a good thing, but I wish Google had done a little more to tune Assistant for wearable use. When I ask it to play a certain song, for instance, Assistant only does so after telling me the name, the artist and the service it's playing on. Uh, maybe just play the damn track, Google.

Sometimes, Google Assistant appears to listen to what I'm saying and then fails to do anything about it. These weren't arcane commands, either — I asked the Assistant to play a song or playlist I had requested multiple times before, and it just hung. This was such a pervasive issue that I sent my first review unit back to Google on the suspicion that it was defective. The replacements I received didn't exhibit the same problem quite as often, but it still happened once or twice. My network connection was strong, and I make it a point to speak extra clearly to virtual assistants, so I can't really explain what's causing these failures.","assistant

But he is also a trained filmmaker and says that's where his heart is. ""I've always wanted my shows to feel more cinematic because that's how I enjoy my music,"" he said. ""I love this idea that people, when I look out into the crowd, it looks like they're going to the movies.""

The problem with 3D, however, is that eight years after the release of James Cameron's Avatar, the technology falls squarely in the realm of gimmick. The 3D box office is down to its lowest point since 2009, and Greg Foster, the CEO of Imax Entertainment, has said that 2D film demand is beating 3D in North America. Most cinema 3D glasses create a darker, blurrier image, and require looking at a screen in a set position.

""3D has gotten a bit of a bad name due to a lot of really poor 3D movies that are not that great to look at,"" said Ryan Pardeiro, chief operating officer at 3D Live, the company behind the hardware at Ellison's show, and who is also a co-producer.

3D Live touts its technology as viewable from 120 to 140 degree angles, meaning the holographs looks good from around a concert hall. The display -- a wall of screens behind Ellison on stage -- are LEDs, not projection-based, meaning a brighter screen. Pardeiro speaks of the technology as a kind of shared augmented reality: combining virtual and physical elements within a venue to immerse the audience in an extension of Ellison's vision.

However, even if you exceed your audience's imagination -- as Ellison wants to do -- that ""wow"" moment then becomes the new normal. To keep people entertained, you have to raise the bar again and again.

At Flying Lotus in 3D, the job of the VJs and 3D artists is essentially to externalize Elliot's avant-garde mind. Strangeloop (real name David Wexler) and Timeboy (aka John King) co-produced the show and operate the live visuals. Wexler described the overarching aesthetic as ""dirty and vibey,"" the feeling of entering ""Lotus' universe."" When asked what that meant, their responses oscillate between whimsical and terrifying. ""His universe? Oh man, that's a really fun place to go to and sometimes very shocking,"" said King. ""Sometimes shocking, sometimes fun, sometimes scary,"" said Wexler. ""Always very cinematic."" ""He has a very playful sense of humor,"" said King. ""Filled with some humor, some horror, some irreverence,"" said Wexler.

""Pushing the boundaries of comfortability sometimes,"" concluded King. ""It's definitely one happy fucked up family, but in the artistic sense, I personally love to go there too and test the senses, test perceptions.""

About 60 feet in front of the stage, blending in with the sound and lighting technicians, the two VJs are set up with MacBook Pros. With 3D Live, they created a palette of some 400 3D animations, controlled through Resolume Arena software.

""I love the fact that it can go wrong at any moment. We're all in danger, creatively.""

Wexler plays cinematic 3D clips, essentially steering the visual theme, with his laptop's keyboard. King has the venue's strobe lights mapped onto a Akai MPK MIDI keyboard. He uses the keyboard controller as well as a Novation Launchpad -- a grid of illuminated buttons that electronic musicians typically use to play musical samples and construct beats-- to trigger individual rhythmic elements within a 3D animation. King and Wexler are playing the lights and 3D animations as if they were instruments. There is no set list; the whole performance is improvised both musically and visually, making each show different. Ellison can't even see what animations are going on behind him.

""I don't like to rehearse, and I don't like practicing because it never really translates,"" said Ellison, showing his jazz roots. ""I love the fact that it can go wrong at any moment. We're all in danger, creatively.""

The one-hour show itself -- few breaks for chitchat, no encore -- is a jam session between audio and visual realms, with all three artists trying to communicate with each other through sound and light, anticipating where the other is going next.

The sheer spectacle of it is powerful at times, and the audience whoops with every piece of virtual detritus that appears to fly over them. Those moments, like in certain 3D movies, can feel like a breaking of the fourth wall, a holograph that bridges the physical space between performer and audience. Objects appear to surround Ellison: giant jellyfish, human heads that melt like pink modeling clay in a microwave, or a Star Destroyer-like ship that sails above the heads of the crowd. Plumes of virtual smoke meld with a real-life smoke machine, blending the audience's idea of what's real and fake.

""Having that extra layer of propulsion and depth really enhances that visceral feel,"" said Tim Saccenti, a longtime photographer and music video director who's collaborated with Ellison, and attended the show on a different night. ""It's so overwhelming that you're almost depersonalized.""

Yet it's the cohesion between the visuals, lights and music that keeps the audience engaged. Strobes might match a bass drum before going off on a rhythm of their own, while the 3D at times created an ethereal, infinite swirl of stars or fractal neon patterns, like a visualizer receding deep into what looks like a tunnel behind the DJing and rapping Ellison. Whether in hip hop or comedy, improvised performances make you trail artists as you hurtle through unfamiliar terrain together, not knowing whether they'll sail or swoop next. The fact that this trip involves a holographic medium foreign to the crowd added to the mystery of where it would lead, keeping them in the moment.

""Halfway through the show, people forget that it's 3D.""

When the show works, it's because of this back-and-forth between 3D as a dazzling wave of an individual moment, and as a refined, responsive interplay between visuals and audio for the crowd's attention to surf along.

""You need to have some of that spectacle, I think, just to get people into the headspace of what is possible and hopefully choose the right moments where it artistically makes sense to go there,"" said Wexler.

""Halfway through the show, people forget that it's 3D,"" King said. ""I think you have to remember to let that feeling come in and out. Get them immersed and then pull back a little bit, so that they're not just adjusted to the fact that it's 3D and then boom, okay, it's a 3D gimmick.""","north america most cinema

We wrote, ""If the Bose QuietControl 30 is out of your price range but you still want Bluetooth, the Phiaton BT 100 NC is a solid alternative.

This is the lowest price we've seen on our upgrade pick in our best dash cam guide.

Street Price: $280; Deal Price: $200

A rare drop, we see this discount about once a year.

The ELAC Debut B6 is our runner-up pick in our best bookshelf speakers guide. We wrote, ""The value and quality of the ELAC Debut B6 speakers come as no surprise.

We wrote, ""AncestryDNA is our pick for those who want to learn about their relatively recent ethnic roots or are seeking to connect with unknown relatives. Though all of the DNA services we tested provided broadly similar results for the ethnic origins of our panel of testers, AncestryDNA did a better job than its rivals of presenting this data in a clear manner while placing the information in a useful historical context.""

Tom VanHaarenESPN Staff Writer ,"Dwayne Haskins comes off the bench to lead Ohio State past Michigan for the sixth straight year, keeping the Buckeyes' playoff hopes alive.",2017-11-25T20:50:11Z,espn,No. 9 Ohio State closes out Michigan without J.T. Barrett,http://espn.go.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/143438/no-9-ohio-state-closes-out-michigan-without-j-t-barrett,http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1125%2Fr294146_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- For the first time in the 120-year history of “The Game,” Ohio State rallied from a 14-point deficit to win, beating Michigan 31-20. The Buckeyes were able to do so by mounting a comeback behind backup quarterback Dwayne Haskins for most of the second half.

Senior quarterback J.T. Barrett was injured in the third quarter, and Haskins didn’t miss a beat, leading an 11-play, 78-yard drive to put Ohio State ahead 21-20 in the third quarter. Haskins finished the day throwing for 94 yards on six completions, and his unwavering performance kept the Buckeyes’ playoff hopes alive.

At 10-2 and currently ranked No. 9 in the College Football Playoff rankings, the Buckeyes have an opportunity to play their way into the playoff if they can pull off a victory over No. 5 Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game next Saturday in Indianapolis.

That possibility was kept within reach by the back-and-forth battle that took place in Ann Arbor and a comeback that was drawn out over the entire second half. Those playoff hopes looked as though they were fading early in the game as the Wolverines held Ohio State to minus-6 yards of offense in the first quarter.

Michigan took a 14-0 lead in the second quarter on a 2-yard Khalid Hill rush and a 3-yard catch by tight end Sean McKeon. The Buckeyes then started to pick it up on offense, though, and scored 14 unanswered points to tie the game at 14 at halftime on a touchdown run and pass by Barrett. The Buckeyes gained 350 yards in the game.

Karan Higdon put Michigan ahead again on a 2-yard touchdown run, but Ohio State's Denzel Ward blocked the extra-point attempt. Barrett was injured on a scramble on the Buckeyes' next drive, but Haskins led the Buckeyes down the field, completing a 27-yard third-down pass to Austin Mack and gaining 22 yards on a scramble as the Buckeyes took the lead for good after a J.K. Dobbins 1-yard touchdown run.

The game was seemingly never out of reach for Michigan (8-4), a double-digit underdog, but the offense couldn’t finish in the second half. Michigan quarterback John O’Korn completed 17 of his 32 attempts for 195 yards, but he made some untimely mistakes.

O’Korn overthrew two wide-open receivers in the first half that would have extended drives, something that has plagued O’Korn the entire season. He threw a costly interception in the fourth quarter that put the game away for Ohio State.

The win keeps Ohio State coach Urban Meyer undefeated against Michigan, as he is 6-0 against the Buckeyes' archrival. The Wolverines have just three wins over the Buckeyes since 2000, and one in the past 14 years.

Neither O’Korn nor Barrett finished their final rivalry game the way they had hoped -- O’Korn with a loss and Barrett with an injury -- but Barrett and his team still have the opportunity to play for more.

To add to what lies ahead, the Buckeyes have seen this scene play out before, with Barrett suffering an injury against Michigan in 2014 and the backup quarterback stepping in and not missing a beat. That season, Cardale Jones came in to replace Barrett, then a redshirt freshman, and helped lead the Buckeyes to the national championship. Barrett's status is unknown for the Wisconsin game.

But this victory, with Haskins at the helm, helped give Ohio State the possibility to re-create that magic.","michigan rick osentoskiusa

Ivan MaiselESPN Senior Writer ,"College football has caught up to Kelly's scheme, but at UCLA he'll have access to more talent than he could lure to Eugene, along with a comfortable fit in Los Angeles.",2017-11-25T16:50:17Z,espn,"Chip Kelly won't turn UCLA into Oregon, but he doesn't have to",http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/21554071/chip-kelly-returns-college-football-comfortable-fit-ucla,http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2010%2F0312%2Fncf_g_kelly11_576.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"We take for granted that two programs with the profile and reach of UCLA and Florida would chase after Chip Kelly. That's important to remember, because if the Bruins think that Kelly will do in Westwood what he did at Oregon, they will be disappointed.

When Kelly took over the Ducks nine years ago, he took over a program good for eight or nine wins a season and turbocharged it into national prominence. Kelly's up-tempo spread offense revolutionized college football. That's the only way a program like Oregon, with little winning tradition and even less of a local recruiting base, could play on the national stage.

Editor's Picks By hiring Chip Kelly, UCLA finally shows it's all-in Long viewed as a sleeping giant, UCLA is suddenly wide-awake after making a bold play for Chip Kelly and proving that the Bruins are finally going for it in football.

""I think it was one of the most profound changes in college football that's happened in a long time,"" said Cal offensive line coach Steve Greatwood, who coached at Oregon for more than two decades, including all four seasons under Kelly. ""Early on, people didn't know how to handle it,"" Greatwood said. ""Defenses couldn't get lined up. Adding the quarterback as part of the true run game without being an option team, being a zone team but having that element of the quarterback run and being able to spread the field and utilize all 53⅓ yards of the field was pretty revolutionary. ... We really caught the defensive world of college football off-guard.""

What benefited Kelly at Oregon -- the element of surprise, the excitement/panic that occurs when someone manipulates the X's or O's in a way that upends the status quo -- is gone. Defensive coordinators have a better grasp on how to stop the up-tempo spread than they did a decade ago. Officials have a better grasp on giving defenses a chance to substitute players.

The football gods taketh, and they giveth. At UCLA, Kelly will be recruiting to a brand name. Kelly's record at Oregon is even more remarkable given the talent differential that existed between the Ducks and the sport's elite. When Oregon took the field against Auburn for the BCS National Championship seven years ago, the Ducks had no one in the same talent zip code as Tigers quarterback Cam Newton or defensive tackle Nick Fairley. Yet Oregon took Auburn to the final play before losing, 22-19. Put another way, when the balance of talent didn't tip away from the Oregon sideline, Kelly's Ducks went 29-1 against unranked opponents -- the lone loss a 51-42 shootout to Stanford in 2009.

Kelly made Oregon a national player in recruiting -- remember when he flipped scatback De'Anthony Thomas from USC to Oregon on signing day in 2011? But now Kelly doesn't have to do that. He can stay home and recruit. In Westwood, Kelly can't drive to Starbucks without running into a four-star recruit. There will be no need for a Willie Lyles, whose recruiting assistance in Texas resulted in probation for Oregon and a show-cause restriction against Kelly.

Nearly half (41 of 93) of the Ducks' signees in Kelly's four seasons in Eugene came from California. Kelly built Oregon into a national power on the backs, hands and feet of California recruits. That's not unusual for Oregon or any team in the Pac-12. But it's relevant given his return to the conference.

That's a good thing, because Kelly's distaste for recruiting is well known. He talked about the draining time demands of it to Philadelphia Magazine four years ago. Mark Helfrich, his offensive coordinator and successor at Oregon, mentioned it on ESPN Radio last year.

According to his former Oregon assistants, Kelly doesn't like the ballyhoo of recruiting, the godding up a 17-year-old. Kelly doesn't do ballyhoo.

""Chip is very good at evaluating,"" said Nick Aliotti, the Pac-12 Networks analyst who ran Kelly's defense. ""We spent a lot of time in evaluation. What Chip is not good at is the tweeting and the schmoozing. He can do a nice job on the home visit. That's just his social makeup.""

""He wasn't the kind of guy who was just a bird dog on a recruit, calling a recruit all season long,"" Greatwood said. ""I mean, you got him in front of people, he's impressive, the way he carries himself. I think he didn't like the whole process of taking a kid from early January and recruiting him all through the following February to signing date. I think that kind of took its toll on him.""

Kelly is an introvert who calls watching video ""the fun part of the job."" He doesn't want to be a celebrity, which is another reason why he is at UCLA instead of Florida. The last thing Kelly wants is to be in Florida who Nick Saban is in Alabama, who Kirby Smart is in Georgia, or who any state university head coach is in the Southeastern Conference.

It was enticing to think about Kelly in Gainesville. Kelly has no ties to Florida, which is not to say he didn't fit a familiar and beloved profile. Let's see: guru of an exciting, fast-paced passing offense; winner of a conference title at a school that had been a perennial doormat; coach known for his dislike of recruiting -- Kelly fit a lot of the profile of the Head Ball Coach.

But let's not stretch the comparison too far. Steve Spurrier liked being the public face of his program, maybe a little too much if you're Jim McElwain. Kelly is an introvert who soured on dealing with the media at Oregon and never warmed to it at either of his NFL stops. When Greatwood says Kelly ""is just a football guy,"" he means it as a test of purity.

The rest of the job -- the care and feeding of boosters, the ego puffery of 17-year-old recruits, the guy who does TV commercials -- no, thanks (although Kelly's Tostitos ads when he coached the Philadelphia Eagles were terrific).

""I don't think Chip likes that kind of stuff,"" Aliotti said. ""In L.A., you can be hidden.""

There are few high-profile jobs that carry a lower profile than being the head coach of UCLA in Los Angeles. When the sports spotlight gets around to college football after the Dodgers or the Lakers or the Clippers or the NFL teams, it tends to shine a few miles east of Westwood, on the John McKays and Pete Carrolls of the Southland. UCLA is not USC.

USC is winning again, and with a coach, Clay Helton, who can turn a spotlight dim. That's one skill Kelly doesn't have, even as the unique circumstances that made Oregon a national power and Kelly a national name don't exist in UCLA.

Kelly brings a high profile to Westwood, even as he just wants to be a football guy, even as he makes a market-value salary (close to $5 million per), even as he jockeys for position in the Pac-12 South.

It won't take another revolutionary change for Kelly to win at UCLA. But it will be fun to see what he has up his sleeve. Too bad we have to wait 10 months to find out.","steve dykesgetty images kelly

(1:07)

It takes timing and investment to change the trajectory of a college football program. UCLA just delivered on both.

A sleeping-giant program known for being a bit sleepy in its decision-making and desire suddenly is wide-awake. By firing Jim Mora when it did, big buyout be damned, and swooping in to hire Chip Kelly days later, UCLA won this year's coaching carousel before it really started to spin.

UCLA sensed an opportunity with Kelly available and Florida closing in and went for it. Such administrative aggressiveness is required in a sport in which the money and stakes are bigger than ever, and in which every program aspiring for national success must ask itself: How bad do we want to win?

Until recently UCLA didn't have a strong answer. The school's substandard football facilities stuck out on an otherwise first-rate campus, an idyllic place where school and sports mixed well but football never seemed to be pushed to the front of the line. Rick Neuheisel was right when, after being fired as UCLA's coach, he told ESPN Radio that UCLA ""takes a knife to a gunfight"" in college football's arms race.

""I think every program across the country has to make a determination as to what their expectation level is and then finance that expectation level,"" Neuheisel said in 2011, ""and in some places those numbers don't jibe.""

UCLA made a larger commitment with Mora and in August opened the much-needed, painfully overdue $65 million Wasserman Football Center on campus. But the school's investment would truly be tested by its decision on Mora, who went 4-8 last year and led another underwhelming team despite an NFL-ready quarterback in Josh Rosen.

Even as UCLA couldn't stop the run -- a year after being unable to run the ball -- and the losses piled up, Mora didn't face the same heat as did other underachieving coaches. Many thought Mora's buyout, north of $12 million, would once again save him, especially at a California state school without SEC- or Big Ten-like revenue streams from its league or booster base.

But early Sunday, hours after the Bruins competed well against USC but lost their third straight to their rival, UCLA fired Mora. On his 56th birthday, no less. Harsh? Sure. Yet programs that aspire to be great can't wait around when opportunity knocks.

The Mora move surprised those in his camp as well as some around the UCLA program, accustomed to a more methodical approach. But UCLA had a plan: Bring Chip Kelly back to the Pac-12, a league he dominated in four seasons at Oregon. Kelly went 33-3 in Pac-12 play with the Ducks, winning three league titles, a Rose Bowl and a Fiesta Bowl and reaching the national title game in 2010. He joins a program that hasn't won the Pac-12 since 1998 and won a mostly down South Division just once under Mora despite plenty of NFL talent on the roster.

Pac-12 coaches joke that UCLA is usually the second-best-looking team in the league but fifth or sixth in the final standings. Kelly is exactly the type of coach to blend substance and style.

His Oregon teams featured several stars from the Los Angeles area such as Kenjon Barner and De'Anthony Thomas. While Kelly had to expand his recruiting reach to Texas and other areas because of Oregon's remote location, he should have an easier time finding exactly who he needs in UCLA's backyard.

Don't discount Kelly's celebrity, either, especially in a town that revolves around it. While USC was knocked for failing to hire a big name in its past two searches -- to be fair, there was no free-agent candidate quite like Kelly available for the Trojans -- UCLA will immediately attract more attention in a crowded media market with Kelly as its leader. USC always will have inherent advantages over UCLA, but with all due respect to coach Clay Helton, who has done well, Kelly gives the Bruins an edge in coaching.

A reminder: There are no sure things in coaching. Kelly's system was novel at Oregon and might be easier to curtail these days. The roster isn't in great shape to win in the short term. He's not a gung-ho recruiter, which could hurt in an extremely competitive region and received an 18-month show-cause order from the NCAA in June 2013. Kelly will be under the microscope on the trail, especially after the previous Bruins staff didn't have the cleanest reputation. But UCLA's mere actions here -- firing a coach who likely deserved it but had a huge buyout, aggressively pursuing and landing the top candidate in the cycle -- should get its fans excited.

The Chip Kelly move comes down to this: For the first time in recent memory, UCLA is going for it in football.

And that deserves an eight-clap.","deanthony thomas while kelly

(1:21)

Taking a spin around the NFL to get you ready for the rest of Week 12:

The big questions

Can the Saints take L.A. by storm?

There is only one game left on this NFL docket featuring two teams with winning records: an unlikely heavyweight bout between the New Orleans Saints (8-2) and the Los Angeles Rams (7-3) at the Coliseum.

Thanks to a comeback, overtime victory against the Washington Redskins in Week 11, the Saints joined the 1947 Bears as the only team to win eight straight immediately following an 0-2 start. New Orleans has it going on offensively. The Saints are leading the league in yards per game (415.7), second in passing (271.7 YPG) and third in both rushing (144 YPG) and points per game (30.2). Quarterback Drew Brees is tops in completion percentage (71.6), and Mark Ingram is tied for most rushing touchdowns in the league (eight).

The player Ingram is tied with is the Rams' Todd Gurley, who is enjoying a resurgence under new head coach Sean McVay. Quarterback Jared Goff (16 touchdowns, four interceptions) has taken off, as well. Despite scoring just seven points in a Week 11 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Rams are still averaging 30.3 points per game (second in NFL) after scoring just 14 PPG last season. According to the Elias Sports Bureau research, this will be just the fourth time since the 1970 merger that two teams averaging at least 30 points per game meet this late in the season.

Fittingly, theirs in the highest over/under line of the weekend, at 53.5.

Will home field be the difference? Not necessarily, given how this season has gone so far. The Rams are actually better away from the Coliseum (5-1) than they are at home (2-2). The Saints are 4-1 outside of the Superdome. And the Rams will likely be shorthanded Sunday, as wide receiver Robert Woods is expected to be out with an injured shoulder.

Is Paxton Lynch the answer to Broncos' QB woes?

The 3-7 Denver Broncos are going with quarterback Paxton Lynch this week against the Oakland Raiders, because why not? Trevor Siemian and Brock Osweiler have combined for 12 TDs to 14 interceptions, heading an offense that ranks 27th in completion percentage, 30th in Total QBR and 24th in points per game (18.3).

Lynch, who missed two months’ worth of practices after injuring his right shoulder in a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, is finally ready to step in. He represents the last, best hope that the answer to the team's QB problem lies on the roster.

The Broncos moved up in the 2016 NFL draft to select the Memphis product 26th overall. The 6-foot-7, 244-pound Lynch was unspectacular in three appearances as a rookie, completing 59 percent of his throws with two touchdowns and one interception. Lynch has a 23.3 career Total QBR, second-worst in the NFL since the start of last season, ahead of only Bryce Petty, per ESPN Stats & Information. Siemian won the job out of training camp in '16 and was tabbed again this season.

Lynch gets his chance to show he has made strides since starting a pair of games as a rookie. And Denver is putting him in a good position to succeed right out of the gate. The Raiders' defense ranks dead last in opponent QBR, TD-INT ratio and opponent completion percentage. Perhaps Lynch can get some wind in his sails Sunday. If he can't take advantage, that'll only add to the front-office heartburn. Spinning on the QB carousel is no way to live. If anyone knows that, it's vice president of football operations John Elway.

Numbers that matter

1: Number of wins Tom Brady needs to pass Brett Favre for the most victories by a starting QB in a single season after turning 40 years old (nine). The Pats are 16-point home favorites Sunday against the Dolphins.

27: The number of consecutive games the Cleveland Browns have lost on Sundays, the longest streak of its kind in NFL history. Eight-point underdogs to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 12, the Browns are on the verge of starting 0-11 in consecutive seasons. The only team that has done that is the 1976-77 Buccaneers.

5.0: Rushing yards per carry for the Miami Dolphins since dealing Jay Ajayi to the Philadelphia Eagles, up from 3.8 before the trade. Philly has no regrets. The Eagles are averaging 144 rushing yards in the second half alone over their past two games. Before the trade, that number sat at 69.3.

398: Number of career completions for Panthers QB Cam Newton when targeting TE Greg Olsen, 184 more than the next-closest receiver (Steve Smith). The Panthers have activated Olsen from injured reserve ahead of Sunday's visit to the New York Jets -- good news for the Panthers, who are 7-3 after winning three in a row. Olsen missed the previous eight games with a broken foot.

8: Number of catches Julio Jones needs this week against the Bucs to pass Anquan Boldin for the most catches by a player in his first 90 games in NFL history. He enters with 551 career receptions, an average of 6.2 per game.

What we'll be talking about after Week 12

Alex Smith vs. Patrick Mahomes

The Kansas City Chiefs have dropped four of their past five games, including an overtime loss to the lowly New York Giants in Week 11. Quarterback Alex Smith was in the MVP discussion as he helped lead the Chiefs to a 5-0 start, but he has experienced a statistical decline across the board in the weeks since. His three interceptions on the season have come in the past two games.

The Chiefs selected QB Patrick Mahomes with the 10th overall pick in the 2017 draft, but he has yet to see the field in the regular season. If the offensive slump continues -- Kansas City has scored a touchdown on a league-low 17 percent of red zone drives since Week 6 -- outside buzz on the merits of a QB change will pick up.

Internally, it could be a different story. The Chiefs (6-4) maintain a two-game lead in the AFC West. There's a good chance coach Andy Reid would lean toward stability and allow the veteran Smith to work out of a rough patch rather than prematurely pull the plug.

The best scenario for them is to eliminate the conversation altogether. Smith can help in that cause with a strong showing at home against the Buffalo Bills. Kansas City enters as a 10-point favorite.

The Falcons as an emerging contender

What you need to know in the NFL

• Statistics

• Scoreboard

• 2017 schedule, results

• Standings

The 6-4 Falcons host a 4-6 Bucs team that will be without QB Jameis Winston (shoulder). Atlanta has a 76.6 percent win probability, according to ESPN FPI. If things go as projected, that would be three consecutive victories for a team that battled a Super Bowl hangover early on but has looked more sturdy of late.

The good news for the Falcons is that four of their final six games are at home. The bad news is they play the Saints twice and still have to host the Panthers and Vikings. If nothing else, they'll have ample opportunity to make headway both in the NFC South and conference standings by playing teams currently above them.","bryce petty per espn stats information siemian

Mike TriplettESPN Staff Writer ,"The cornerback's absence puts pressure on the rest of the Jaguars secondary to perform, but this unit has risen to the occasion before.",2017-11-25T12:00:36Z,espn,Fantasy Fallout: Jalen Ramsey's hand injury offers hope to Larry Fitzgerald owners,http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/258900/fantasy-fallout-jalen-ramseys-hand-injury-offers-hope-to-larry-fitzgerald-owners,http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1124%2Fr294006_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Maybe, just maybe, Larry Fitzgerald can become the first receiver to score a touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars since Week 1.

Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey told ESPN's Michael DiRocco that he doesn't expect to play Sunday at the Arizona Cardinals after injuring his hand in practice Friday. It's unclear how long Ramsey might be sidelined. But if it's anything long-term, that might offer hope to receivers like T.Y. Hilton, Doug Baldwin and DeAndre Hopkins over the next three weeks as well.

Ramsey's status could be a huge development for the fantasy playoff stretch, because no unit in the NFL has been as dominant as Jacksonville's secondary.

The Jaguars have allowed by far the fewest fantasy points this season to receivers (21 per game in ESPN leagues) and quarterbacks (7.4 per game). They have allowed just 162 passing yards per game (best in the NFL by nearly 25 yards). And they haven't allowed a touchdown pass to a receiver since Hopkins in Week 1 (but they were still so dominant in that game that they inspired the Houston Texans to bench quarterback Tom Savage by halftime).

The absence of Jalen Ramsey leaves a hole in the Jaguars secondary that wide receivers hope to exploit. Logan Bowles/Getty Images

Missing Ramsey may put a dent in that dominance -- but it's not like Fitzgerald will be completely off the hook.

For one thing, the Jaguars' other starting cornerback, free-agent prize A.J. Bouye, and slot cornerback Aaron Colvin have both played great this year as well.

For another thing, ESPN fantasy analyst Mike Clay pointed out that Fitzgerald lines up in the slot 66 percent of the time -- and the Jaguars haven't done a lot of shadowing with Ramsey against top receivers this year. So Ramsey might not have matched up with Fitzgerald the most in this game anyway.

It doesn't seem to matter, since the Jaguars have also allowed the fewest fantasy points to slot receivers this year, according to Clay's numbers. So Hilton (40 percent in the slot) and Baldwin (76 percent in the slot) won't be off the hook, either. Hilton had just two catches for 27 yards when the Indianapolis Colts first played Jacksonville in Week 7.

What you need to know in the NFL

• Statistics

• Scoreboard

• 2017 schedule, results

• Standings

ESPN Arizona Cardinals reporter Josh Weinfuss said no matter who is covering Fitzgerald, he expects QB Blaine Gabbert to target him frequently on Sunday. The Cardinals have never shied away from targeting Fitzgerald against other top cornerbacks, and Gabbert and Fitzgerald have started to develop a rapport.

So obviously you don't want to bench Fitzgerald -- or Hilton or Baldwin or Hopkins, for that matter. You'd just better hope that your fantasy playoff life doesn't hinge on a breakout performance from any of them.

""Every fantasy owner should have concerns when their No. 1 WR has to line up vs. the Jags secondary,"" ESPN NFL analyst Matt Bowen said before Ramsey's injury. ""This is the best unit I've watched on tape all year. Physical, aggressive and tough. These guys challenge routes all day long.""

Now, you might point out that the Jags gave up a surprising six catches for 80 yards to Cleveland Browns receiver Corey Coleman last week. But DiRocco noted that Cleveland's DeShone Kizer also threw two interceptions while targeting Coleman -- and that Ramsey wasn't pleased about Coleman's performance and is determined to make up for it going forward.

So whenever Ramsey comes back, he might be more determined than ever to ruin your fantasy playoff hopes.

Kirkpatrick,One of the most striking aspects of the carnage at a Sinai mosque: How easy it was for militants to carry it out.,2017-11-25T17:39:22+00:00,google-news,"In Egypt, Furious Retaliation but Failing Strategy in Sinai",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/world/middleeast/egypt-sinai-mosque-attack-sufi.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/26/world/26sinai/26sinai-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"After an explosion, they positioned themselves outside the main entrance of the mosque and its 12 windows, spraying the worshipers with gunfire. Seven parked cars were set ablaze to prevent victims from escaping. Among the dead were 27 children.

For Sinai residents, the attack deepened an abiding sense of dread about life in a part of Egypt where many feel trapped between barbarous militants and a heartless military. At a hospital in nearby Ismailia, survivors recounted how they leapt through windows as militants raked them with gunfire, or of watching their friends and relatives die.

“If even mosques are being targeted, then where are we safe?” said Mohamed Abdel Salam, 22.

For Sinai experts, the assault sharpened scrutiny of Egypt’s counterinsurgency tactics against a dogged Islamist insurgency that has surged in strength since 2013, after Mr. Sisi came to power in a military takeover.

They paint a picture of a stubbornly outmoded approach that is unsuited to the fight, and that perpetuates the mistakes of successive Egyptian leaders.

For decades Egypt has seen Sinai through a military prism, taking an aggressive approach to an alienated local population. The military has engaged in summary executions and the destruction of whole villages, while offering little to solve the region’s deep social and economic problems, including chronic unemployment, illiteracy and poor access to health care.

Egyptian soldiers and conscripts are hunkered down inside heavily protected bases, venturing out in armored convoys that barrel down long, exposed roads.

Those roads are filled with check posts manned by nervous soldiers, many of them conscripts. The insurgents, some with roots in Sinai’s long tradition of smuggling, skirt through the desert.

“The Egyptians have failed to acknowledge that ISIS is not just a terrorism threat,” said Andrew Miller, a former Egypt specialist at the National Security Council, now at the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington. “Killing terrorists is not sufficient. They need to deprive ISIS of local support, which is rooted in Cairo’s historical neglect of the Sinai.”

But that support has been eroded by multiple accounts of torture and extrajudicial executions by the military, as well as indiscriminate military tactics that often inflict civilian casualties and sow widespread resentment.

“The military has never cared for civilian losses,” said Mohannad Sabry, author of a book on Sinai. “The excessive and reckless use of force has killed entire families. We’ve seen airstrikes blow people up in their homes. We’ve seen villages razed off the face of the earth. That tells you something about how they see Sinai society.”

Over the past year, Mr. Sisi has welcomed a line of foreign leaders to Cairo, where he signed deals for billions of dollars in advanced military equipment: German submarines, Russian combat helicopters, a French aircraft carrier and a military satellite. American military officials have tried quietly to persuade him to allocate his resources, including $1.3 billion in annual American aid, to tools and techniques better suited to fighting the insurgency in Sinai, like equipment and training for intelligence gathering.

But Mr. Sisi, they say, is not listening, and his generals prefer to buy tanks, jets and other heavy weapons for their bases around the Nile.

“They understand they have got a problem in Sinai, but they have been unprepared to invest in the capabilities to deal with it,” said Steven Simon, a professor at Amherst College and a former senior director for the Middle East and North Africa on the National Security Council.

One person who did have some sway over Mr. Sisi was Egypt’s chief of defense staff, Mahmoud Hegazy. American officials saw him as the only person in Mr. Sisi’s inner circle with the authority to publicly contradict him, a former United States official said. They also had a personal bond: General Hegazy’s daughter is married to Mr. Sisi’s son.

But last month Mr. Sisi fired General Hegazy, after an outcry over a devastating militant ambush on a security convoy south of Cairo that killed 16 police officers, and possibly many more.

The move dismayed senior State and Defense Department officials who saw General Hegazy as a check on Mr. Sisi in a circle of advisers that has become ever smaller and, some fear, ever more sycophantic, said the former official, who spoke anonymously to protect internal deliberations on an important ally that rarely receives public criticism well.

Sinai presents a formidable arena for counterinsurgency that would challenge the most capable army: It is a vast terrain of desert and mountains, with long shorelines and a semiporous back door across the border into Gaza, which has been controlled by Hamas.

The collapse of Libya in 2011 has ensured a steady flow of weapons ever since, some from the depots of the deposed Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi. In the past year, as the Islamic State’s vision of a caliphate in Syria and Iraq has crumbled, experts have fretted about an influx of returning Egyptian jihadis, bent on bringing their fight back home.

So far, American officials say, a relatively small number of fighters have returned. But the collapse of Raqqa and Mosul has precipitated a sharp shift in the Islamic State’s tactics in Sinai, with a greater emphasis on attacks against soft targets, like Coptic Christians and Sufis, in a bid to undermine Mr. Sisi by sowing sectarian hatred in Egyptian society.

Little of Egypt’s fight against the Islamic State in Sinai is visible to the outside world, or even most Egyptians. Foreign reporters and most Egyptian ones are not allowed into Sinai. Concrete information about the conflict is hard to come by: On its Facebook page, the Egyptian military claims to have killed at least 3,000 Islamist militants, far more than the hundreds it once estimated were there.

A leaked videotape last April depicted those claims in a very different light. It showed a military unit, made up of Sinai locals and accompanied by senior army officers, executing detainees — local men in jeans — on a desolate patch of ground in Sinai. Earlier, on its Facebook page, the army had claimed the men died in a shootout.

Amnesty International, which confirmed the video’s authenticity, said it was consistent with a pattern of military-led abuses it has documented in Sinai.

In private, Mr. Sisi’s officials argue that they don’t need to take lessons from the Americans. They point to what they say is a failure of American counterinsurgency ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan. And they add that their methods worked in the 1990s and 2000s, at least temporarily and in other parts of Egypt, when President Hosni Mubarak authorized harsh measures to disarm militants who attacked Western tourists at historical sites.

“They look back and say: This is how we did it, and it worked,” said Zack Gold, a Sinai expert at the Hariri Center at the Atlantic Council. But, Mr. Gold added, the conditions are radically different in North Sinai, where residents have suffered years of neglect and mistreatment from the Egyptian mainland.

Sinai residents complain of feeling isolated, even culturally distant, from the Nile Valley where the vast majority of Egyptians live. Many in the North Sinai refer to other Egyptians as “people of the valley,” as though they were citizens of another country. Some speak nostalgically of more effective governance when the peninsula was under Israeli control, between the Israeli seizure of the area in the Six Day war in 1967 and its return to Egypt in 1982.

The Bedouin tribes who live there, often portrayed as outlaws in Egyptian popular culture, say they feel greater kinship with the tribes in Gaza — a connection that has bred longstanding suspicion among officials in Cairo, especially since the Israeli occupation.

South Sinai, around Sharm el Sheikh, and Mount Sinai developed into a tourist destination. But the North remained loosely governed and some of the tribes who lived there considered smuggling a birthright, and resented Cairo’s attempts to restrict it.

“Many Egyptians west of the Suez don’t consider the Bedouin to be fully Egyptian,” Mr. Miller, the analyst, said. “They have poorer educational and employment opportunities, and they are largely shut out of government jobs and the security services.”

Cynicism about the central government was evident outside the Ismailia hospital on Friday, where an elderly Bedouin woman in black sat on the muddy lawn, huddled under a blanket for warmth. She refused to give her name, citing fear of reprisals from either the military and Islamic State. “If either side sees our names, they will kill us. They are as bad as each other,” she said.

“The military will keep jailing and killing local young people. The terrorists who hate us and the Christians will keep using it as an excuse to kill us,” she added. “There is no point in talking about anything.”","delta gaza israel el arish bir alabed suez canal jordan cairo sinai peninsula egypt saudi arabia nile sharm el sheikh

(CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed amendments into law that will allow foreign media outlets in Russia to be listed as ""foreign agents,"" according to state-run news agency Sputnik news.

Russian officials have said the change is a retaliatory response to the US government's request that RT, the Russian TV network, register its American arm as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

Sputnik reports the amendments signed by Putin had been previously approved by both chambers of the Russian parliament.

""According to the text of the law, media that receive financial assistance from foreign states or organizations can be recognized as foreign agents, while the decision on which outlets will be classified as 'foreign agents' will be taken by the Ministry of Justice.""

Stacy Cowley and Emily Cochrane,A legal battle over who can appoint the temporary chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after its director abruptly resigned on Friday.,2017-11-25T21:04:00+00:00,google-news,Who Will Be in Charge on Monday? That’s the Question in Agency Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/business/trump-officials-say-they-can-name-agencys-temporary-chief.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/26/business/26CFPB/26-cfpb-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Mr. Trump’s decision shortly afterward to name his own temporary director was a “typical routine move,” said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Mr. Mulvaney is a fiscal hawk who previously called the agency a “sad, sick joke” and once, as a member of the House, sponsored legislation to end its existence.

A formal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel was expected to be released soon, the officials said. In two past opinions, issued in 2003 and 2007, the office had argued that the president has the authority to use the Vacancies Act to override an agency’s designated succession path.

“We have gone out of our way to avoid any unnecessary legal battle with Mr. Cordray,” the administration official said. “His actions clearly indicate he is trying to provoke one.”

Mr. Cordray had been expected to resign at the end of the month. Instead, in the middle of a holiday weekend, he said he was leaving and named Leandra English, the agency’s chief of staff, as deputy director.

Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the consumer bureau, the deputy director serves as the agency’s acting head in the absence of permanent leadership. Mr. Cordray, citing that act, said he expected Ms. English to take over from him.

Democrats, who fought for the bureau’s creation and championed its work as a valuable defense against predatory companies and abusive financial practices, are likely to push for a legal challenge to Mr. Trump’s move.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who proposed the consumer bureau and helped set it up, said Mr. Trump’s move was legally impermissible.

“The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: If there is a CFPB director vacancy, the deputy director becomes acting director,” she wrote on Facebook. “President Trump can’t override that.”

Some legal experts say there is merit to question whether the Vacancies Reform Act supersedes an individual agency’s designated line of succession.

“No court has addressed this legal question,” said Aditya Bamzai, a law professor at the University of Virginia. “Any Office of Legal Counsel, in any administration, would have given the same answer with respect to this issue. But if we see a legal challenge, the executive branch’s positions don’t always prevail in court.”

Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, says it’s an “open question” which act — the vacancies law or Dodd-Frank — should prevail, especially because Dodd-Frank was enacted more recently.

At stake are two different views on how the bureau should be run. As President Trump and his administration work to loosen regulations on businesses, the consumer bureau has been a prominent holdout. It is still carrying out the agenda it developed under President Barack Obama, issuing new rules — like a recent regulation intended to sharply curtail the payday lending market — and sanctioning financial companies for practices that it considers unfair or abusive.

The agency was established six years ago, and it has unusually broad power to combat abuses in a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans. But the agency has long been vilified by Republicans as an overreaching, aggressive government arm.

The appointment of Ms. English to the deputy director position was seen as an attempt to delay Mr. Trump from appointing his own interim director. Confirming a permanent director could take months. Mr. Cordray’s confirmation was delayed for two years by Republicans and the banking industry, two parties that objected to the agency’s creation and sought to limit the attempt at federal oversight.

Mr. Mulvaney will shoulder his new acting leadership on top of his role as director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is unclear how he will manage both roles, and the officials directed all questions about the mechanics of the situation to Mr. Mulvaney.

“We think he’ll show up Monday, go into the office and start working,” an administration official said of Mr. Mulvaney’s plans.

But it may not be that simple. The next move lies with Ms. English: She will need to decide whether to legally challenge Mr. Mulvaney for the bureau’s leadership, or defer to him.

“It’s a very awkward legal scenario if they both show up literally at the same office,” said Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa. “It seems like both sides are trying to engage in gamesmanship here.”","elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts

Airman Chialastri was the valedictorian of his 2013 graduating class at Woodlawn High School in Baton Rouge, La., Scott Stevens, the school’s principal, said in an email on Saturday.

Sgt. First Class Jill Pearl, who taught Airman Chialastri in the high school’s Junior R.O.T.C. program, recalled him in a phone interview on Saturday as serious and studious but leavened with humor.

As early as his freshman year, Sgt. Pearl said, she predicted that he would serve as battalion commander in his senior year, a position in which he would lead the 200 students in the program.

Airman Chialastri left Junior R.O.T.C. after his sophomore year because he wanted to focus on his studies. His passion for the armed services remained. Nobody was surprised when he enlisted in the Navy, Sgt. Pearl said.

“We were so excited about that,” she recalled. “He was dependable, he was loyal. He could handle any situation that you put him in. And it just looked like he did it with such ease.”

The crash was the fifth accident this year for the Seventh Fleet, which is based in Yokosuka, Japan, and includes 20,000 sailors and 50 to 70 vessels.

The Navy relieved Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the head of the Seventh Fleet, of his command in August, and Navy officials said two of the previous accidents — naval destroyer crashes that killed a total of 17 people — had been avoidable.

Capt. Michael Wosje, the commander of Carrier Air Wing Five, praised the search and rescue teams, which covered nearly 1,000 nautical square miles over two days.

“The entire Navy team is working together to investigate the cause of this mishap and we will remain focused on our mission to operate forward in a safe and professional manner,” Captain Wosje said in the Seventh Fleet’s statement.","view all new york times

“Day after Thanksgiving. Woo! I’m stuffed!” host Mika Brzezinski said to open the show.

“A great Thanksgiving,” Joe Scarborough replied before they both offered a few awkward chuckles.

The live MSNBC show — which airs five days a week — seemed normal at first, but a few fans were quick to notice it wasn’t unfolding in real-time.

The network did not indicate the show was taped a day ahead of the holiday, though the “Live” graphic typically on the screen had been removed, the Washington Post reported.

The second Friday segment maintained the post-holiday theme, with Brzezinski joking about how she “always cooks the turkey with the guts in it.”

An executive for MSNBC said there was no intention to be deceitful. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Daily Front Row)

“Joe didn’t notice. He ate the bag,” co-host Willie Geist added.

Scarborough also made mention of Thanksgiving football before pivoting to discuss the sexual assault allegations aimed at Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.

The broadcast was also paired with a news crawl, added after the show was taped Wednesday, which mentioned the deadly attack on an Egyptian Mosque. The hosts never referenced the story though, because it had yet to happen when they filmed.

The brutal strike left more than 300 dead and hundreds more injured.

A longtime viewer reached out to the Washington Post and questioned if the duo were sharing “fake news” as they were not covering the current events.

“I was quite flabbergasted by the way they were so deceptive about this ... especially when they are always so quick to castigate lying or deception they attribute to others,” the unidentified viewer said.

An MSNBC executive confirmed with the newspaper that the program wasn’t live, but denied purposefully misleading those tuning in.

“There was no intention to trick viewers,” she said. “Would it have helped if there was a disclaimer? Maybe. But that’s not typically done.”

With the disease a distant memory for most, it’s easy to miss the fact that there are still those suffering the effects of the disease decades after its initial strike.

The iron lung was an invention that helped keep thousands of sufferers alive, by breathing for those who had lost the ability through the degenerative effects of the disease. A small handful of people are still relying on those machines today, and there’s a problem – who is around to keep these machines running?

The story is a powerful one, made up of interviews with those who still rely on their machines on a daily basis to stay alive. Particularly poignant is Lillard’s account of the repairman who came to fix her machine, and tried to leave before putting it back together. As someone who needs the machine operational to survive, this obviously wasn’t going to cut it.

Overall, these are people who have relied on help from friends, neighbours, and local tinkerers to help keep their machines running long after the companies responsible have long stopped supporting the hardware. This has led to an unenviable situation for Lillard herself – she’s no longer able to purchase replacement collars that seal her neck to the machine, as the subsidiary of Phillips responsible only has ten left in the country and will no longer sell to her. Naomi Wu and others are organising on Twitter to find a way to remanufacture these parts. If you’re in the know, or otherwise have the expertise, get involved or throw your ideas down in the comments.

It’s not the first time we’ve heard dark stories of medical equipment from years past – the story of the Therac-25 is particularly chilling.

The XC90s, priced from $46,900 at U.S. dealers, will be delivered from 2019 to 2021 in the first commercial purchase by a ride-hailing provider, Volvo said in a statement Monday. San Francisco-based Uber will add its own sensors and software to permit pilot-less driving.

Dara Khosrowshahi Photographer: David Ryder/Bloomberg

Uber’s order steps up efforts to replace human drivers, the biggest cost in its on-demand taxi service. The autonomous fleet is small compared with the more than 2 million people who drive for Uber but reflects dedication to the company’s strategy of developing self-driving cars. Last year, Uber agreed to use 100 XC90s for self-driving tests in Pittsburgh and later struck a deal to include autonomous vehicles from Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz in its network at some point.

But the status of the project was unclear after Alphabet Inc.’s driverless car division Waymo sued Uber this year, claiming the ride-hailing company stole trade secrets, and the U.S. Justice Department opened an inquiry into the matter. Uber has said it didn’t use stolen information. Shortly before taking over as CEO in September, Khosrowshahi said Uber must focus on the core business, which raised questions about the costly self-driving program.

“This new agreement puts us on a path toward mass-produced, self-driving vehicles at scale,” Jeff Miller, Uber’s head of auto alliances, told Bloomberg News. “The more people working on the problem, we’ll get there faster and with better, safer, more reliable systems.”

For carmakers, news of Uber buying vehicles at a commercial level means potential new sales, but also looming disruption to a business model that sees autos largely sold to private owners. Uber’s $70 billion valuation already puts the group almost on a par with Germany’s Daimler.

The deal will boost sales at Volvo and should also help lower the cost of the Chinese-controlled group’s own fully-autonomous cars planned from 2021. Volvo engineers have been working closely with Uber to develop a base vehicle with core driverless technology that the ride-hailing company can then augment. Volvo plans to use those cars for its own future offering.

The Five Levels of Vehicle Automation

For more on self-driving tech, check out the Decrypted podcast:

“The automotive industry is being disrupted by technology and Volvo Cars chooses to be an active part of that disruption,” Chief Executive Officer Hakan Samuelsson said. “It’s a new market that’s emerging and we’re the first to be delivering into that segment.”

Lyft Inc., the main ride-hailing alternative in the U.S., has said it’s also building driverless cars but has mainly focused on partnerships. Among those that have agreed to test autonomous vehicles on Lyft’s platform are Delphi Automotive Plc’s NuTonomy, Ford Motor Co., Jaguar Land Rover and Waymo.

Uber, which didn’t put a time frame on when it might introduce driverless rides, said its approach means anyone in the industry can “deploy its tech.” It highlighted people using hand signals and eye contact to negotiate traffic as one of the major challenges remaining for autonomous autos.

David Griffin,"The Punisher goes up against his archenemy, while David tries to reconnect with his family.",2017-11-17T08:00:32Z,ign,"Marvel's The Punisher: ""Memento Mori"" Review - IGN",http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/17/marvels-the-punisher-memento-mori-review?abthid=5a15f4b9b0cfacd815000031,http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/11/18/punisher1281-1511036658843_1280w.jpg,gaming,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Share. The story of Billy the Kid. The story of Billy the Kid.

Full Spoilers Following for Marvel’s The Punisher: “Memento Mori.” Make sure to keep up with all of our Marvel's The Punisher binge here.

Marvel’s The Punisher ends on a quiet note for Frank Castle. Without a war to fight, the troubled soldier must find a new way to exist in a society that still fears him. “Memento Mori” does everything a good finale should do, but not in the moments of over-the-top action and violence. Instead, the episode is at its best when dealing with the aftermath of this bloody season.

There’s a price to pay for Frank’s vengeful rampage across New York City. Having consequences is a necessity in order to tell an effective story centered around Frank Castle. If he just killed hundreds of people and felt no remorse or sorrow, then this would be a less effective series.

Frank’s decision to join Curtis’ group was an unexpected move. In order to get better, Frank is going to try to help others by talking about his own struggles. Castle’s admission that he’s afraid was a powerful moment - one that Bernthal acted out perfectly. The skull spray-painted on his chest was a vivid reminder that death is always around the corner. It’s the way he’s been living since the death of his family. It’s the only way he knows how to live. Now that Frank is dealing with the fear of the unknown, how will he cope? Hopefully, Curtis’ group will be enough for him.

A guy who could have used a nice group talk is Billy Russo. His story was fleshed out further with a lovely flashback. This was the perfect scene to show before Frank and Billy’s showdown. It beautifully sets up the tragic nature of their animosity towards each other. The series continues to prove that its characters didn’t become who they are overnight. Billy’s transformation from the charming good-looking friend playing with Frank’s kids, to the emotionally troubled individual laying in the hospital bed is the result of years of self-deprecation.

The story of Billy the Kid is a tragedy and that’s who Billy chooses to model himself after. Even when he’s talking to Curtis during the standoff with Frank, he still sees himself as the victim. Curtis and Frank both tell Billy that he always had friends, but Billy can’t see past his own pain. Like the man he claims to admire, Billy’s tale is a tragedy too, but if The Punisher is going to have a second season, then it’s a necessary one.

It’s great to see Frank Castle trying to rebuild his life, but this is a Marvel Netflix superhero show after all, so the fight must go on. Billy Russo’s comeback will likely be the reason Frank Castle comes out of hibernation in Season 2. Barnes and Bernthal are always fun to watch, so it will be enjoyable to see them together again.

Speaking of the second season, what does the ending mean for the rest of the ensemble? While David wasn’t the primary focus in the finale, there is plenty of work ahead for the boys, since Russo is still alive. Bernthal was excellent this season, but Moss-Bachrach was the beating heart that made it all work. If it wasn’t for David, and Frank’s interaction with his family, events would have turned out different for The Punisher. With friends like David, Frank has a reason to live.

Madani helped Frank out in the end, but her future remains uncertain. The Homeland Security and CIA components never solidified into an interesting story. They felt like outsiders looking in on a better show. Overall, Marvel’s The Punisher was an enjoyable entry into the Marvel Netflix lineup, but the writers need to work on Madani and the other government officials to make them feel significant.","brian michael bendis

Snake eyes. Snake eyes.

Loot boxes whose contents rely on chance don't meet the UK's criteria for unlawful gambling.

According to the UK Gambling Commission, since the prizes unlocked in loot boxes are usable only in the games in which they're won, and can't be cashed-out, they don't fit the bill for ""licensable gambling activity.""

While loot boxes, like those found in EA's Battlefront II, Blizzard's Overwatch, and more games, don't fall under the umbrella of an illegal gambling operation, the commission still expressed concern over the practice in games.

Exit Theatre Mode

The commission said while ""the line between video gaming and gambling is becoming increasingly blurred,"" its job is to step in when the practice meets the definition of gambling under UK law.

Belgium recently pushed to ban loot boxes in Europe, its own Gaming Commission determining loot boxes do fall under its authority. In the United States, the ESRB determined loot boxes were not gambling under its own criteria.

Concerns over EA's system in the recently released Star Wars: Battlefront II caused the EA to temporarily remove microtransactions from the game. Hawaiian state representative Chris Lee proposed legislation to ban the sale of games featuring loot boxes to anyone under the age of 21. However, Lee's influence is limited to the state level, and as of yet, no such legislation has been proposed at the federal level.

Alex Osborn,"The co-creator of Lost and The Leftovers believes ""what we think about superheroes is wrong.""",2017-11-25T20:09:34Z,ign,"HBO's Watchmen Aims to Be a ""Dangerous"" Show - IGN",http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/25/hbos-watchmen-aims-to-be-a-dangerous-show,http://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/11/23/watchmenjpg-f9b98d_1280w.jpg,gaming,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Share. ""These are dangerous times and we need dangerous shows."" ""These are dangerous times and we need dangerous shows.""

Lost and The Leftovers co-creator Damon Lindelof recently shared new details about his next project, an adaptation of Watchmen, which received a pilot order from HBO back in September.

During a panel at Vulture Fest (via IndieWire), Lindelof was asked why he opted to tackle a comic book property after finishing The Leftovers. In response, the showrunner highlighted how Watchmen is a ""dangerous"" graphic novel, which is something he'd like to carry over in the TV adaptation.

""The reason I'm doing this is because these are dangerous times and we need dangerous shows. What we think about superheroes is wrong,"" Lindelof explained. ""I'm all for Wonder Woman and Batman,"" he added, noting that while he loves with these superheroes, ""we should not trust people who put on masks and say they are looking out for us. If you hide your face you are up to no good.""

Exit Theatre Mode

The showrunner recalled his experience reading the first issue of Watchmen when he was 12, noting that while the graphic novel was ""probably too mature"" for him, ""it crackled with energy."" Referring to himself as a ""superhero junkie,"" he said that while he's ""never done a superhero movie or a superhero TV show... now is the time.""

While HBO has yet to officially greenlight a TV series adaption, Lindelof said that in the event the network does pick it up for a full series, he thinks it would debut sometime next year or in 2019. According to comments from HBO president Casey Bloys earlier this year, the potential series won't be a straight adaptation of the graphic novel.

Earlier this month, Lindelof posted the following image on Instagram, accompanied by the caption: ""Day 40.""

Lindelof's latest work, the critically acclaimed HBO drama The Leftovers, concluded with its third season earlier this year. For our thoughts on the show's emotional conclusion, read IGN's The Leftovers: Season 3 review.

With Justice League now out, here are our picks for the best Caped Crusaders in cinema. With Justice League now out, here are our picks for the best Caped Crusaders in cinema.

With Justice League now in theaters (our review here), it's time to light up the Bat-Signal, call all the Dark Knights to action, and figure out who the best movie Batman truly is.

Whether they appeared only once as the Caped Crusader or starred in a full-fledged trilogy, these stars all hold the honor of donning the cape and cowl of Gotham's one true protector. Whether it was an animated release, a colorful tongue-in-cheek romp, or a grounded and gritty take on the vengeful vigilante, the following actors breathed life, for better or worse, into Bruce Wayne and his cranky costumed alter ego. (And a note: We're not including the Batmen from the old movie serials here because movie serials aren't really movies.)

In Justice League, Ben Affleck's Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman call together a team of super-powered heroes to face off against Ciarán Hinds' Steppenwolf. This new iteration of Batman has yet to be featured in his own standalone film, and when that movie comes around there's a good chance Affleck won't be in it, but how does the Bat-fleck of now stack up against Batmen of the past? Check out our Best Movie Batman rankings below...

8 George Clooney

Fans were excited when George Clooney was announced as Val Kilmer's replacement for Joel Schumacher's follow up to Batman Forever. Clooney was super hot from NBC's ER and had proven himself to be a capable action hero in From Dusk Till Dawn. Little did we know that Batman & Robin would wind up being the worst Batman installment of the '80/'90s run (and of any decade, really) and that Clooney himself would actually be bad as Batman in it. It's one thing to be the best part of an awful movie, but Clooney was no saving grace. Years later, he'll still readily apologize for ""ruining Batman"" - though he wasn't solely responsible. A lot of effort went into making Batman & Robin a cartoonish, nippled mess.

Exit Theatre Mode

7 Val Kilmer

Strong-jawed Val Kilmer was director Joel Schumacher's first Batman, for a mixed bag of a film, Batman Forever, that was a half dark and half over-the-top stab at making the franchise more kid-friendly. With Kilmer's stint came the (modern) franchise's first attempt at making Batman be more than just a side character/afterthought in his own movie. Unfortunately that meant that Kilmer's Bruce Wayne had to, essentially, forget why he was Batman. Yes, Batman's arc in the movie involved him being plagued by a dream that he'd eventually come to recognize as the buried memory of the night he decided to become a vigilante who dressed up like a bat.

6 Will Arnett

♪""Darkness! No Parents!""

As a breakout character from The LEGO Movie, Will Arnett's hilarious tragedy-obsessed action hero-bro eventually got his own spinoff movie. Cleverly expanding on some of the character's most famous themes, the film tackled both Bruce Wayne's deep-rooted desire to push away friends and family for their own protection and Batman's almost symbiotic relationship with arch-nemesis The Joker. Arnett's comedic delivery and a funny script combined to create a memorable character-focused animated adventure.

Exit Theatre Mode

5 Ben Affleck

The already-mega famous Ben Affleck came into the costume as part of DC and Warner Bros.' attempt to jump-start a huge cinematic universe with the second movie of a franchise. After the Tim Burton films and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, the feeling was that you could now easily skip over Batman's origins (though we did get that flashback to Crime Alley) and just have him exist as an already established character with little build up. And for the most part that worked, mostly thanks to Affleck's brooding, sarcastic take on Bruce and Batman's understandable resentment of Superman.

4 Michael Keaton

When established comedic actor Michael Keaton was cast as Batman for Tim Burton's seminally dark, gothic cinematic take on the character, fans were in an uproar. Well, as big of an uproar as there could be back before the internet. Later on though, after two films, fans could hardly imagine anyone else playing the character when the news came that Keaton was leaving the franchise. That says a lot for the actor on this list who probably did the most with the least. Keaton was able to create a vital and memorable Batman despite sometimes feeling like a supporting character in movies that shined huge spotlights on the villains and their respective origin stories.

Exit Theatre Mode

3 Adam West

Adam West was best known for playing Batman on TV, sure, but the 1966 Batman movie that sprang from the series, featuring West's Batman and Burt Ward's Robin (and some Bat-Shark Repellent spray) squaring off against all their major adversaries - Catwoman, Riddler, Joker, and Penguin - is an essential camp classic. For an entire generation, West, and the good-hearted, campy nature of the '60s show, was the quintessential take on Batman. This was the tone and style that Joel Schumacher tried, and failed, to evoke with his two films (particularly with Batman & Robin). Only the beloved West and his delightfully dry delivery could pull this off.

2 Christian Bale

The most complete Batman movie journey (even though you may have issues with the way the story ended or with Batman's ""SWEAR TO ME! voice) can be found within Christopher Nolan's compelling and grounded Dark Knight trilogy, featuring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman. In almost a direct response to the previous franchise's inability to properly focus on Batman himself, the Nolan films took a deep dive into Bruce's origins and motivations, even spending an entire movie on his transformation into the Caped Crusader. Bale himself may arguably have been a better Bruce Wayne than a Batman, but his tormented take on the character's self-loathing and guilt, along with a strong desire to actually stop being a hero once he felt like Gotham was in good hands, made for an iconic performance.

1 Kevin Conroy

Kevin Conroy, through just his groovy and gravely voice acting alone, worked to create one of the most iconic and long-standing representations of Batman to date. Batman: The Animated Series ran for over 80 episodes in the mid-90s and stands, for many, as a near-perfect representation of the Dark Knight and his foes. The series gave us two movies, one of which, Mask of the Phantasm, got a theatrical release, and led to Conroy voicing the character on other shows within the DC animated universe - up through, even, 2010's Batman: The Brave and the Bold (in a guest capacity). Conroy also voiced Batman in three of the four Arkham games, once again proving the fact that for most fans he was, and still is, the definitive voice of the character.

Well, no, because Wonder Woman – but kind of yes since Justice League was such a bust and he's played by Magic Mike alum Joe Manganiello. Manganiello took to Twitter Saturday to wordlessly reveal the first photo of himself in character as Slade Wilson (not to be confused with Wade Wilson, another sword-wielding superhuman named after death), and we have a sneaky feeling we're going to watch that movie.

The end credits of Justice League showed Deathstroke about to team up with Lex Luthor for a formidable supervillain alliance, an injustice league, if you will (you probably won't). As Mashable previously noted, Deathstroke was supposed to appear in a stalled Batman film, so this clip could be setting up sequels to Suicide Squad or Justice League itself.

Or here's an idea: Deathstroke as the villain in Wonder Woman 2, so we get some of the DCEU's redeeming characters on screen together (again, all we have is a photo).

In the D.C. Comics, Deathstroke is a master fighter, highly trained by the military and able to use 90 percent of his brain capacity thanks to a biological advancement serum. He became an assassin, a job that eventually got his son killed and made his wife leave him. This sounds like the most intense origin story, but the D.C. creative team doesn't need our help, right??

When it comes to Secret Santa or gift exchanges with a price limit, it's sometimes hard to find a genuinely good gift that's cheap and useful. Sure, you can find something under the limit pretty quickly, but does the recipient really need a pair of socks with taco cats on them?

Check out our list of gift items under $10 that the person will actually use.

If you've got a friend who is constantly asking for the aux cord, give them the gift of a portable speaker. This portable Bluetooth and aux speaker was originally $89.99 and now only $9.99. Its 5W high performing drivers and built-in subwoofer plays tunes with super crisp, high-quality sound. The recipient won't be able to anywhere without it.

We all have that friend or family member that is super particular about the food on their plate touching. This convenient, anti-soggy compartment bowl for $8.49 is the solution. Keep things separate even if they're going to the same place: milk and cereal, chips and salsa, veggies and dip — whatever it is, it can go in here.

This rechargeable wireless mouse for $9.99 lasts for three months on one charge and has silent clicking, making it as quiet...as a mouse.

If you've got a pal that has to document every single moment, give them the gift of a universal smartphone clip-on lens to spice up their photos even more. For $8.99, they can take wide angle, macro, and fisheye effect shots, regardless of what kind of smartphone they have.

Avocados are amazing. But there isn't anything more startling than opening the fridge and seeing half of an avocado sitting in a plastic bag, starting at you with its giant eye. This set of avocado huggers for $7.95 is the perfect little gift for any avocado lover. The silicon cup ""hugs"" half of an avocado, making storage easier and keeping the fruit fresh longer.

Know someone whose wallet is literally overflowing with credit cards, gift cards, and other unexplainable things? Help them out when they're fumbling in the dark with a credit card lightbulb for $7.99. It stores flat like a credit card but has a flip-up light, so they don't have to use their phone to see into the recesses of their bag.

If you know someone who takes loving breakfast food to the Leslie Knope level, this mini waffle maker is about to become their best friend. An Amazon Choice product for a reason, this little guy heats quickly and cooks the perfect personal-sized waffle evenly — because burnt spots are just plain gross. Choose from six colors and get them for just $9.99 here .

If you've got a friend who would enjoy sticking just about any object to the wall, this is the gift for them. Grip Strip is made from a polymer compound and though it looks like a glorified car mount, it actually holds almost anything, anywhere: a phone to the car dash, a can of soda to the wall, or a frying pan to the ceiling. Get yours for $9.29.

Red wine seems like the hardest thing to get out of clothes. If you've got a friend who can't seem to keep the drink in the glass, this red wine stain remover for $8.00 is about to be the handiest gift they've ever received. Working with red wine as well as juice, coffee, and other stubborn household spills, white shirts and table cloths are safe again.

Going to the bathroom in the middle of the night is a hassle, to say the least. Give your pal the gift of a glowing toilet bowl with this motion sensor LED toilet night light for $9.99. It lights up in 16 different colors and gives off just the right amount of light to see, so you won't get blinded by the overhead light.

The world of wearable fitness has seriously blown up. No longer are hardcore athletes the only ones keeping up with there calories and mileage — these babies have been taking over our lives year by year. And with this surge to the everyday consumer, it seems like not a day goes buy where a new brand or version of wearable fitness trackers are thrown at us.

We all need a little motivation to get up and get going, right? And nothing says motivation like the perfect fitness tracker that helps you meet your specific personal goals. Check out our list of what's on the market and the basics of different trackers, just in time for the holidays.

SEE ALSO: This smart lunchbox will give you a crash course in meal prep 101

The fitness tracking world doesn't have to be intimidating — the award winning Moov Now makes everything simple. Though the lowest priced tracker on our list, the number of things it does is amazing: aside from the expected step and sleep tracking, it also acts as a personal fitness coach, with real-time audio feedback and running, cycling, swimming and boxing data. Made for training, Moov Now also shows you how to work out in proper intervals for the fastest, safest #gains. The only thing it doesn't have is GPS. Get it on sale for $40.20 here.

Kate Spade New York is a designer brand that makes chic jewelry. The brand also has a super elegant fitness tracker disguised as chic jewelry. The mother-of-pearl bangle looks just like a regular bracelet, but links with an app to track steps, sleep, and fitness goals. The tracker alerts you with vibration notifications and lets you control music and take selfies as well. If you or someone you're gifting wants to track their activity without sporting a rubbery fitness band, the Kate Spade bangle tracker is the one. Choose from silver, gold, or rose gold and get it for under $50 here.

If you're set on getting a Fitbit but aren't sure where to start, the Fitbit Flex 2 is a good place to begin. Designed as a more general-purpose tracker, the Flex 2 is thin, light, and subtle. It tracks the usual steps, calories, etc., as well as sleep, but the stand-out feature is that it's Fitbit's first swim-proof tracker. Though it does benefit from SmartTrack for automatic workout recognition, it's much less advanced than its siblings, making it a perfect first Fitbit. Get it on sale for $59.90 here.

Fitbit has taken the fitness tracking world by storm and it might seem impossible to keep up with the latest from the brand. If you're set on a Fitbit and want the best of all features combined, the Fitbit Charge 2 is your device. Including the usual step, calories, and sleep tracking, the Charge 2 uses PurePulse to monitor your heart rate and rate VO2 Max (a scientific gauge of fitness) and a personalized cardio fitness score. If you want the best of all worlds, get the Charge 2 on sale for $129.99 here.

If you (or the person you're gifting to) constantly complains about the world's smartphone addiction, the Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro could be their best friend. This tracker is one of the only ones with built-in GPS and Spotify streaming, meaning you can listen and track where you go without connecting to the app, meaning that extra device can be left at home. Don't worry — it still lets you keep track of phone notifications and respond to calls and texts right from your wrist. Get it for $149.99 here.

The Garmin Vivosmart 3 is the thinnest of the brand's line, but there's a lot packed into this little device that makes it helpful for people who aren't runners or gym-goers. The Vivosmart 3 isn't just a fitness tracker, but a stress tracker as well. The heart rate monitor measures your heart rate while it's resting to give you a stress score, with a guided breathing feature designed to lower stress when the score is too high. The Vivosmart 3 also monitors strength training by tracking sets, reps, and rest times that can be reviewed on the app — a feature that many trackers don't have. Get it for $139.99 here.

Music is a must have during a workout, and though you could carry around an extra device for your tunes, it'd be nice to have everything in one place. The TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music can store music locally on the tracker and be paired via bluetooth. You can also set up smartphone notifications and the GPS will tell you how to get back if you get lost. Get it on sale for $190.99 here.

Smartwatches

Looking for something a little more all-encompassing? These smartwatches have all of the fitness tracking features you're looking for, plus all of the connected capabilities of smart tech.

If running is your thing (or the thing of the person you're gifting to) the Garmin Forerunner 235 could be the fitness tracker to go with. This tracker has impressively fast GPS with four customizable running settings, including settings for indoor and outdoor running as well as phone notifications to be turned on or off. The heart rate monitor on the 235 is also notable to track workout intensity. Get it for $299 here.

If you're looking for something more than a fitness tracker but less intense than an Apple watch, the new Samsung Gear Sport may be for you. It features water resistance up to 50 meters, built-in GPS, automatic workout recognition, activity and calorie tracking (eaten and burned) and acts as a personal fitness coach on your wrist. The powerful device also falls into the smartwatch category: Enjoy receiving and responding to calls and texts, Spotify playback, real-time control of compatible smart devices like appliances, locks, and lights, and access to all of your favorite apps. This is all compiled into a compact device that looks like a classic round watch, and it weighs next to nothing. Get it for $249.99 here.

The new Apple Watch Series 3 with Nike+ is pretty much the ultimate combo of smartwatch and fitness tracker. It sports a sleek, rectangle design and looks less like a traditional round watch, with smartwatch features like LTE support, calls and texts, music streaming, and phone notifications. As a fitness tracker, the Series 3 has a super accurate heart rate monitor and alerts you of any abnormalities. Nike+ takes running to the next level with guided runs, motivational notifications, and in-ear coaching. Though the Apple Watch does not automatically recognize that you've started an exercise, you can simply launch the workout app (or any other third-party app). The expected GPS, water resistance, and distance tracking are also present, and there's actually a slightly less expensive version of this Apple Watch Series 3 that is GPS only (no LTE). Get the Apple Watch with Nike+ for $549 here.","motherofpearl bangle

Cozmo is still the coolest robot on the block.

The robot toy from Anki isn't just a regular toy, it learns from the people around it and remembers faces and names. Cozmo was the coolest kid's gift last holidays and it hasn't lost its charm.

A Mashable Choice product, Cozmo is currently on sale for $149.99. That's $30 less than its regular $179.99 price tag. This is the gift that will make you the hippest aunt/uncle/sister around.

The lucky new owner will not only get a robot but they'll get a friend. Cozmo is a robot that can play games, explore terrain and help a new coder learn how to program. The creators of Cozmo told Mashable they wanted it to feel alive and be able to interact, rather than those other robots that just make jerky movements and beep loudly.

It worked. This lovable robot appears more like a pet than it does a piece of technology and will make an awesome addition to your life.","auntunclesister

I mean, it literally burns, thus providing a power plant in Sweden with energy.

Northwest of Stockholm, there's a heat and power station that's trying to rid itself of oil and coal. So it's burning recycled wood and trash. That includes 15 tons of H&M clothing from the company's central warehouse so far in 2017, according to Bloomberg.

If you remember the controversy over H&M slashing unused clothing back in 2010, that might sound terrible. But H&M told Bloomberg that the company doesn't ""burn any clothes that are safe to use. However it is our legal obligation to make sure that clothes that contain mold or do not comply with our strict restriction on chemicals are destroyed.""

Ah yes, I always knew moldy $5 striped V-necks would solve the world's energy problems.

Yella Hewings-Martin PhD,Few celebrations happen without food these days. But what if someone in your midst doesn't share your enthusiasm and is a picky eater?,2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Picky eaters and how to cope with them over the holidays,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320169.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320169/picky-eater.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Whether it's your own child or you are experiencing the joys of a picky eater as a mere bystander during the holiday season, you are likely not alone. Up to half of 2-year-olds may be rejecting the lovingly prepared dinner that you are feasting on.



Family meals can be particularly stressful for parents with picky eaters. Family meals can be particularly stressful for parents with picky eaters.

According to my mother, I ate everything as a kid. From homemade purees to cookies dished out by other mothers at the playground, I loved food and still do to this day.

Perhaps you can understand my surprise and subsequent frustration when I was faced with my own child's rejection of my first attempts at food. The lovingly prepared avocado slices, ripened to perfection, and the steamed and pureed apple were rejected outright; nothing was going to pass this kid's lips.

What does my personal predicament have to do with you? If you are a parent, or expectant parent, this story may well resonate with you at some stage of your life. Alternatively, you might be faced with a fussy eater in your wider circle during the holidays.

A new study, published in the December edition of the Journal of Child Health Care, reveals how parents feel about their picky toddler and discusses which strategies work and which don't.

So, what can research tell us about the perils of parents with fussy eaters, and strategies for coping with family meals?

Life with a picky eater

Fast forward 2 years, and my culinary life is still on shaky ground. When other children are happily snacking on berries, olives, and chickpeas, I'm dishing out apple and breadsticks — again.

While I'm enjoying a homemade Thai curry, my toddler is feasting on rice with steamed vegetables: broccoli, carrots, and asparagus, to be precise. These are her current favorites and her repertoire is not much bigger.

I know that my experience in this area isn't unique and I was particularly interested to get my hands on the study, which was led by Bérengère Rubio, Ph.D., at the Department of Psychology at the IFSTTAR Institute in Versailles, France.

In the article, she explains that the statistics vary when it comes to picky eaters. Some studies say that 50 percent of 2-year-olds fall into this category, while others cite a more modest 17 percent by the age of 3.

Most of the time, the items banished to the ""no"" list are fruit, vegetables, and any type of new food, somewhat limiting the child's food repertoire.

Working with 38 parents, Rubio collated their experiences and attitudes toward eating behavior. The results revealed that the overwhelming feeling expressed by parents was one of guilt and failure.

'Family meetings problematic'

Most parents found themselves faced with a picky eater practically overnight and noticed this sudden change at around the age of 2. This seems to be the turning point for many children.

From sorting food into ""yes"" and ""no"" categories, to crying when faced with food or throwing the entire meal on the floor, toddlers were making their opinion perfectly clear, particularly to their parents.

It was not uncommon for children to be more open to eating or trying food in the company of others, such as grandparents or at day-care, but not at home.

Many parents were concerned about their child's health, worrying that they weren't getting enough nutrients or that their limited food intake was putting them at risk of getting sick more often. Yet, previous research has failed to find a consensus about the effect of picking eating habits on children's weight.

Some parents felt that they were being judged by others and failing to meet social expectations.

""Family meetings are problematic, we have to justify to everyone why she doesn't want to eat,"" was one of the statements parents agree to in the study, Rubio writes. As was ""mealtimes are not a nice time.""

So, what are parents doing to cope with their picky eaters?

Mealtime strategies

Most parents found themselves coaxing their kids to eat, or to at least try the food on their plate. Others used modeling, which means showing their child that something is tasty by eating it themselves, or involving the toddler in the process of preparing meals.

Both of these strategies are known to reduce food pickiness, according to Rubio.

There were two other methods that the parents found improved their chances of having their lovingly prepared meal met with greater acceptance: making food look more interesting, for instance, by making it look like a face, and mixing in other foods that their kids like, such as cheese.

On the other hand, some parents used reward or punishment to encourage their children to eat, either by offering them something else as a treat if they ate the food, or by telling them that they wouldn't get a treat if they didn't eat a certain amount of something else, such as vegetables.

Some parents had adjusted all meals to the toddler's taste and accepted that only the favorite food of the moment would pass the child's lips.

But Rubio says that these last two strategies are counterproductive as they ""[...] encourage short-term tasting of the food but are associated over the long-term with pickiness and a restricted diet.""

The fussy eater during the holidays

What President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed in 1863 to be ""a day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dweller in the Heavens"" is today a big, traditional celebration weekend, often involving family and friends.

Kicking off the holiday season, we can now look forward to 5 more weeks of festive fun. Of course, few celebrations are complete without food. It's likely that you'll find yourself enjoying a range of culinary delights over the coming weeks.

So, how does the fussy eater fit into this?

In an article published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, dietitian Kathryn Walton — from the Department of Family Relations and Applied Nutrition at the University of Guelph in Canada — and colleagues suggest that it's time to rethink the concept of picky eating and allow children greater input into food decisions.

Rather than thinking of the picky eater as displaying noncompliant or deviant behavior, work with your child to make sense of mealtimes together, Walton suggests.

""[...] feeding is not just about nutrition, it is about relationships."" Kathryn Walton

The bottom line is that mealtimes with toddlers can be a stressful time, especially at gatherings with family and friends.

Patience and a little bit of understanding for all parties involved can go a long way to get you all through the experience. As a bystander, you may be just the right person for a toddler to emulate, and empty plates may leave parents wide-eyed in surprise.

If in doubt, a smiley face drawn with gravy next to an exploding volcano of turkey and sweet potato, finished off with a hedgehog — pumpkin pie with some raisins sticking out — and your holiday meal may be more fun than you expected.","international journal of behavioral nutrition

Honor Whiteman,"Exercise alone is unlikely to help you shift the pounds, a new study finds. Instead, physical activity should be combined with a healthful diet.",2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Exercise alone does not achieve weight loss,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320174.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320174/a-woman-running-on-a-treadmill.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"If you think that a couple of sessions at the gym will help to work off those Thanksgiving pounds, think again. A new study shows that when it comes to losing weight, exercise alone is unlikely to do the trick — for women, at least.



Exercise alone is unlikely to help shift the pounds, say researchers. Exercise alone is unlikely to help shift the pounds, say researchers.

Researchers at Bangor University in the United Kingdom found that women who engaged in exercise classes three times per week for 4 or 8 weeks — but who did not change their diets — failed to lose any weight.

Study co-author Dr. Hans-Peter Kubis, of the School of Sport, Health & Exercise Sciences at Bangor University, and colleagues recently reported their findings in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.

The study involved two experiments. For the first experiment, 34 women aged 18 to 32 years took part in a circuit exercise training session three times per week for a total of 4 weeks.

The second experiment included 36 women of the same age group, all of whom took part in the same training sessions, but for a total of 8 weeks.

At the beginning and end of each experiment, the weight, muscle, and fat mass of each woman were measured.

Blood samples were also taken from the participants, which allowed the team to measure levels of appetite hormones, including insulin, leptin, amylin, ghrelin, and peptide YY. Such hormones can influence feelings of hunger and food intake.

Appetite hormones may play a role

The aim of this study was to determine whether or not exercise alone would lead to weight loss in the women, but the subjects were not informed of this. Instead, they were told that the study would assess the effects of exercise on cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness. Dr. Kubis says that this was to avoid potential bias.

""When people take up exercise, they often restrict their diet — consciously or unconsciously — and this can mask the effects of the exercise,"" he explains.

At the end of the 4- and 8-week programs, the researchers found that none of the women had lost weight, regardless of whether they were lean, overweight, or obese prior to the intervention.

Lean women, however, did see an increase in muscle mass after the exercise training.

The researchers also found that women who were overweight or obese experienced changes to appetite hormones that were associated with increased hunger. The team says that this may partly explain why exercise alone may not lead to weight loss.

""Our body system is so well regulated, that it always finds a way to compensate for a loss in energy after exercise,"" says Dr. Kubis.

""Whether they are aware of it or not, someone undertaking more physical activity or exercise may experience increased appetite as a result, and this makes it difficult for people to achieve their goals.""

Exercise isn't just about weight loss

The team stresses that they are not saying that exercise has no benefits — far from it. For weight loss, however, physical activity alone is unlikely to be enough.

""To be effective, exercise training for weight loss needs to be integrated into a lifestyle approach to weight loss, including exercise combined with diet."" Dr. Hans-Peter Kubis

That said, Dr. Kubis notes that when it comes to the benefits of exercise, weigh loss should not be the main focus.

""Knowing how much fat and muscle we have in our body is much more important than knowing how much we weigh,"" he says. ""When we focus on weight alone, we miss the improvements achieved via exercise training.""

""Seeing no change on [the] scales may be enough to make people give up on their exercise training, not realizing that they have actually improved their body by gaining muscle mass.""

He adds that gyms and other exercise facilities should incorporate more equipment that focuses on improving body composition.","school of sport health exercise sciences

As with many symptoms of the disease, MS hugs have no clear cause, but medication and self-care can help prevent them, as well as reduce pain and discomfort.

What is an MS hug?



An MS hug may feel like there is something tightly hugging the torso, causing discomfort and pain. An MS hug may feel like there is something tightly hugging the torso, causing discomfort and pain.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spinal column. An MS hug is a less common symptom of the disease.

An MS hug, also known as banding or girdling, is a feeling of pressure around the chest, similar to having something wrapped tightly around the torso. An MS hug is likely to feel different for each person who has it.

MS symptoms stem from a problem with the immune system that causes it to attack healthy nerve fibers and the substance called myelin that coats them. Researchers are still trying to determine the underlying cause of the immune system's reaction.

MS affects the nerves that are responsible for transmitting information about movement and sensation around the body, so these functions are often impaired in people with MS.

The condition has a wide range of symptoms that vary from person to person. Common symptoms include:

tiredness

muscle weakness

difficulty walking

vision problems

chronic pain

How does an MS hug feel?

While the most common sensation is the feeling of pressure on the torso or around the chest, it can affect hands and feet as well. The sensation may make someone feel as if they are wearing tight shoes or gloves when they are not.

It can also affect the arms, legs, or even the head, and may only be felt on one side of the body.

People with MS have described the sensation in a number of ways, ranging from tickling or squeezing to crushing or burning. For some people, it can be extremely painful, making it difficult to breathe.

This feeling may last for a few seconds or be a constant sensation for many months or years. Because it causes pain and discomfort, an MS hug may affect day-to-day activities, such as exercising or sleeping. For people with mild symptoms, an MS hug can be more irritation or annoyance.

Causes



An MS hug is caused by damaged nerve cells sending confused messages to the brain about the sensations the body is feeling. An MS hug is caused by damaged nerve cells sending confused messages to the brain about the sensations the body is feeling.

MS damages the nerves and affects different body and brain functions. An early MS symptom is a tingling feeling that is not caused by a real trigger, such as pins and needles or a burn.

The medical name for this sensation is dysesthesia, which comes from two Greek words that translate as ""abnormal sensation.""

An MS hug is a classic example of dysesthesia because the feeling of pressure does not come from a real band around the body, even though it feels like one. This happens because the nerves sending information to the brain about sensations the body feels are damaged, so they transmit a confused message.

Muscle spasms can also cause an MS hug. The intercostal muscles are small muscles between the ribs that help to move the chest in and out as someone breathes. If there is a muscle spasm or small movement that happens involuntarily, it may cause a stabbing pain or tightening sensation.

What to do

Unless someone has already been diagnosed with symptoms of MS hugs and knows what they feel like, any new chest pain should be checked by a doctor, as it could be a sign of a medical emergency.

People with MS, experiencing the sensation for the first time, should see a doctor and try to explain how it feels, including:

how long it lasted

what it felt or feels like, including any pain

if it came on suddenly or gradually

whether it prevents normal activity or sleep

If an MS hug passes quickly, it may help if a person sits and quietly rests while it is happening. Relaxing may help the feeling pass.

If breathing becomes difficult or painful, or the chest pain is severe and feels like a heart attack, a person should call 911, or their local emergency number, and be sure to tell a doctor about their MS.

Treatment and prevention

An MS hug often goes away without treatment, but medication is available if the feeling is persistent or very painful.

The medication recommended will depend on whether the MS hug is dysesthesia or caused by muscle spasms.



A hot water bottle or warm compress may help to ease pain, when held against the affected area. A hot water bottle or warm compress may help to ease pain, when held against the affected area.

Medications for dysesthesia include:

anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin

antidepressants, such as amitriptyline

over-the-counter medications containing acetaminophen, such as Tylenol

Medications for muscle spasms include:

baclofen, which reduces the messages sent between nerves

carbamazepine, which treats the pain associated with muscle spasms

tizanidine, which blocks the impulse that causes muscles to tighten

Using a pressure stocking, wearing tight clothing, or tying a scarf around the affected area can trick the brain into feeling the sensation of an MS hug as pressure rather than pain. Some people may find this helpful, although others may not.

A warm compress or hot water bottle with a cover on, pressed against the area, can change the feeling of pain to one of warmth.

MS symptoms often worsen if someone is stressed, tired, unwell, or sensitive to heat. If a person is aware of these triggers, it can help prevent an MS hug.

Trying to relax, rest, get medical treatment for an illness, or cool down as needed are all ways to ease the sensation of an MS hug. For some people, loose clothing can feel better than tight clothes and may help to prevent an MS hug.

MS is a long-term condition with no cure, so the treatment will focus on managing symptoms and preventing a relapse. Most people with MS will experience periods of remission when they have few or no symptoms between flare-ups or relapses.

A doctor will help a person with MS make a plan of medication, treatment, and self-care that works for their individual needs. Regular exercise, a healthful diet, and plenty of rest can prevent a relapse and ease symptoms.

Outlook

Although not everyone with MS will experience an MS hug, for some people, they will be an unavoidable part of the condition.

How long their MS hugs last, and the level of pain and discomfort caused, will affect how someone chooses to manage this symptom.

Establishing a good care plan that includes medication can lessen the effects of dysesthesia or spasms. A person can also try to stay rested and reduce their stress, which can help prevent an MS hug and lessen the impact it has if it happens.","antidepressants

Learn about the causes and treatment.",2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Scabs in the nose: Causes and remedies,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320144.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320144/woman-using-neti-pot-to-treat-nose-scabs.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The inside of the nose contains delicate tissue that physical injuries or illnesses can easily damage and inflame. With many blood vessels and nerve endings in this area, bleeding and painful scabs are common issues.

Fortunately, scabs inside the nose are usually harmless and heal on their own with a little care.

Knowing the cause of scabs in the nose and how to care for them is key to helping the nose heal and to preventing future problems.

Home remedies for scabs in the nose



A Neti pot uses a solution of saline and water to clear the nose of congestion. A Neti pot uses a solution of saline and water to clear the nose of congestion.

For scabs caused by minor problems such as allergies and colds, a person can try:

Diffusing essential oils of eucalyptus and peppermint to relieve nasal congestion.

Using a Neti pot to clear the nose of mucus and allergens.

Doing a steam treatment at home by boiling a pot of clean water, letting it cool slightly, placing a towel over the head to capture the steam, and breathing the steam in through the nose.

Drinking plenty of water and non-caffeinated liquids to help the body naturally flush mucus out of the nose.

Applying a warm, wet washcloth over the nose several times a day.

Using saline nasal spray as needed to help with pain and encourage the scab to heal.

Causes of scabs in the nose

Scabs in the nose can be caused by a variety of factors, but most are simple issues that heal without complications. Common causes include:

Allergies

Allergens can cause the inside of the nose to feel itchy, which can lead to rubbing or scratching the nose. This may cause damage to the tissues inside.

This may cause inflammation, bleeding, and the formation of a scab. Even without rubbing or scratching, the ongoing inflammation from allergies can be irritating enough to cause scabs to form.

Irritants

Certain chemicals can irritate the nose, causing inflammation and scabbing. Common irritants include:

fumes from cleaning products

industrial chemicals

cigarette smoke

cigars

Blowing the nose too hard

Blowing the nose is often necessary and helpful. However, blowing too hard can do more harm than good.

Forceful blowing of the nose can not only force the mucus back further into the sinuses, but it can also damage and irritate the inside of the nose.

People who blow their nose too hard and too frequently may notice bleeding and scabbing inside the nose. Repeated forceful blowing can rip the scab off, leading to more bleeding and repeated scabbing.

Trauma or nose-picking

An injury to the nose in an accident or sports can damage the tissue inside, leading to bleeding and scabbing.

Similarly, nose-picking can damage the inside of the nose. Children and adults alike may be guilty of this habit, especially when a cold or allergies lead to a mucus buildup in the nose.

Rhinotillexomania is the medical term for chronic nose-picking. In chronic or compulsive nose-picking, scab formation may prompt the person to blow out or pick the scab, causing more bleeding, scabbing, and an ongoing cycle that does not allow the nose to heal.

Overuse of nasal sprays



Overusing nasal spray may irritate the inner lining of the nose, causing scabs to develop. Overusing nasal spray may irritate the inner lining of the nose, causing scabs to develop.

Some nasal sprays contain a drug known as oxymetazoline, which is designed to shrink the blood vessels in the nose, helping it to feel less congested.

Although it can help the nose feel better initially, using these sprays too often can lead to dryness, irritation, and increased congestion in the nose.

All of these factors increase the risk of scabs inside the nose.

Cold sores (herpes simplex virus)

Although cold sores are most common around the mouth, they can appear in other places, including inside the nose.

Cold sores result from an infection of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). A cold sore usually starts with a burning and tingling feeling, followed by a sore that scabs over and forms a crust.

Pimples or boils

The inside of the nose contains hair follicles that can become infected with bacteria. As a result, a pus-filled boil or pimple may develop.

Boils and pimples can cause pain and irritation. If they are scratched or popped, bleeding and scabbing may result.

Drug use

Inhaling drugs such as methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin can do significant damage to the inside of the nose.

Irritation and scabbing in the nose are common with the use of these drugs. They can also tear, or perforate, the septum inside the nose, leading to serious complications, such as necrosis (tissue death) and holes in the nose.

Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer

Cancer in the nasal cavity, or paranasal cancer, can cause a range of symptoms, including ongoing congestion and nosebleeds. This can lead to irritation and scabbing.

Other symptoms of paranasal cancer include changes in a person's sense of smell, numbness or pain in the face, and changes in vision.

Scabs in the nose and congestion are usually not signs of cancer. If a person is concerned, a doctor can rule out this cause with any needed testing or exams.

Prevention



A person with scabs in their nose should avoid blowing the nose too hard or too often. A person with scabs in their nose should avoid blowing the nose too hard or too often.

A number of steps can be taken to help prevent scabs in the nose, including:

Taking allergy medications as recommended by a doctor.

Blowing the nose gently and only when necessary. If no mucus comes out when blowing, a person should not force it or blow harder, but instead, they should moisten the nasal passages with a saline spray.

Avoiding inhaling drugs, including illegal drugs.

Asking a doctor before using a decongestant nasal spray containing oxymetazoline. If recommended, it should not be used more than twice a day or for longer than 3 days.

Using a humidifier.

Keeping drug-free saline spray on hand to keep the inside of the nose moist. A person should look for sprays that contain only ""sodium chloride"" as the active ingredient.

Not putting fingers or other objects in the nose.

Dabbing petroleum jelly inside the nose helps keep moisture in, preventing the nasal tissues from drying out and bleeding.

Avoiding picking at scabs or bumps inside the nose.

Not smoking and avoiding places where others smoke.

Avoiding strong chemical smells from harsh cleaning products whenever possible.

Wearing a face mask that covers the nose when dealing with chemicals.

Taking medications to prevent cold sores.

When to see a doctor

Although scabs in the nose often result from minor, harmless conditions such as seasonal allergies, a health professional should examine ongoing scabs or discomfort in the nose.

Usually, a family doctor, an allergist, or an ear, nose, and throat doctor (otolaryngologist) can examine the inside of the nose with a light and recommend further testing or treatment if needed.

Blood tests may be required if herpes or a bacterial infection is suspected. In many cases, however, scabs due to allergies and trauma can be diagnosed with a visual exam.

Usually, the cause of scabs in the nose is easily treatable with home remedies and time.","rhinotillexomania

"Timothy J. Legg, PhD, CRNP",Antisocial personality disorder is a condition that affects a person's ability to care about the feelings and needs of others. Learn about the symptoms.,2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Sociopathy (antisocial personality disorder): What you need to know,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320142.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320142/antisocial-man-with-hood-up.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Popular books such as The Sociopath Next Door have popularized the idea of a sociopath as a person who lacks a conscience or empathy.

However, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) does not use the term ""sociopathy"" to describe a mental health condition.

Antisocial personality disorder is the closest diagnosis to sociopathy. Although movies and television shows may present people with this condition as dangerous sociopaths, people with antisocial personality disorder can lead normal, productive lives.

However, they may also struggle with relationships, understanding emotions, and making good decisions. In this article, we look at the signs and symptoms of this mental health condition.

What is antisocial personality disorder?



Antisocial personality disorder is characterised by a lack of empathy, and manipulative or dangerous behaviour. Antisocial personality disorder is characterised by a lack of empathy, and manipulative or dangerous behaviour.

Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses that alter the way a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with other mental health conditions, such as depression, may experience symptoms that undermine their ability to feel good or to have normal relationships.

Personality disorders, by contrast, affect a person's entire personality and their ability to function in culturally ""normal"" ways across many contexts.

Antisocial personality disorder is a personality disorder that impedes a person's ability to care about the feelings and needs of others. People with this condition may harm others, engage in criminal behavior, or consider the needs of others only when doing so benefits them.

Everyone ignores other people's feelings sometimes, and most people can be manipulative, selfish, or uncaring from time to time. For people with antisocial personality disorder, this disregard for others is a hallmark of their condition, rather than an occasional oversight.

Antisocial personality disorder is part of a group of personality disorders called Cluster B disorders. These disorders are characterized by unusual emotional behavior that tends to disrupt relationships and lead to unstable patterns of relating to others.

Other Cluster B disorders include:

Children cannot be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. Children with a pattern of disregarding the rights and needs of others may be diagnosed with a conduct disorder.

Signs and symptoms



Antisocial personality disorder may cause a person to have a lack of inhibition or concern for others, which may make them more likely to break the law. Antisocial personality disorder may cause a person to have a lack of inhibition or concern for others, which may make them more likely to break the law.

A person cannot be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder based on a single action. Behaviors that are explained by something else, such as addiction, trauma, or a cognitive disability, will also not be diagnosed as antisocial personality disorder.

People with antisocial personality disorder struggle to follow or understand social rules about how to interact with others.

They fail to see other people as beings worthy of consideration, kindness, or rights. They may not feel empathy or guilt.

However, not all people with antisocial personality disorder act on these emotions, nor do all people who violate the rights of others have a mental health condition.

A person might be evaluated for antisocial personality disorder after interacting with police, seeking treatment for chronic relationship problems, or being involved in a negative experience with a child or partner.

There are no clinical tests for antisocial personality disorder. Instead, the diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms.

To diagnose a person with antisocial personality disorder, the individual must show the following symptoms:

making decisions based on one's own needs and desires, without considering the needs of others

lacking concern for the needs, feelings, or pain of others, and lacking remorse after hurting others

exploiting others in relationships, making it difficult to have relationships

using lies, domination, or intimidation to control others

exhibiting manipulative behavior, including using charm or ingratiation for one's own benefit

exhibiting dishonest or fraudulent behavior

not being concerned about how others feel; some people with antisocial personality disorder enjoy sadistic behavior, such as hurting others

feeling hostility, anger, or aggression, particularly in response to relatively small problems

lacking inhibitions, which may cause a person to disobey rules, abandon their commitments, or take unnecessary risks

Causes and risk factors

While the exact cause of antisocial personality disorder is unknown, genetic, environmental, and cultural factors may all play a role in its development.

People who are exposed to childhood trauma, whose parents have a personality disorder, or whose parents had an alcohol addiction appear to be more vulnerable to developing antisocial personality disorder. It also affects more men than women.

Treatment



Psychotherapy may help people with antisocial personality disorder understand the emotions of others. Psychotherapy may help people with antisocial personality disorder understand the emotions of others.

A person with antisocial personality disorder may only seek treatment when a court orders them to do so, or when they experience serious consequences, such as incarceration or the loss of an important relationship.

Most people with antisocial personality disorder are never diagnosed and do not seek treatment.

Treatment for antisocial personality disorder focuses on helping a person work around their disruptive thought patterns, behaviors, and ways of relating to others. This usually involves psychotherapy.

Therapy focuses on helping people with antisocial personality disorder understand other people's emotions. A therapist may work with a person to find better ways to deal with aggression or to understand how aggressive or manipulative behavior can be harmful.

There is no medication specifically designed for antisocial personality disorder. However, additional symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse, can be reduced with medication and make psychotherapy more effective.

Outlook

There is no cure for antisocial personality disorder, but treatment can help a person control their symptoms.

There is limited research on the effectiveness of treatment for antisocial personality disorder, and what works for one person might not work for another.

During treatment, a person with antisocial personality disorder will learn to manage their own feelings and impulses and adopt culturally appropriate behaviors. This can be challenging, as they must learn behaviors that most people take for granted, such as caring about the pain of loved ones.

A partnership with a caring therapist and a commitment to making meaningful behavioral changes can increase the success rate of treatment.

Antisocial personality disorder remains poorly understood. People with this condition are often vilified as serial killers or criminals, even though many never harm anyone.

As research continues, doctors may gain a better understanding of this challenging mental health condition.","personality

Learn more about possible risks and side effects here.",2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,"CoolSculpting: Risks, side effects, and results",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320138.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320138/coolsculpting-or-cryolipolysis-being-performed-on-stomach.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"CoolSculpting, or cryolipolysis, is a nonsurgical body contouring procedure. A plastic surgeon uses a device to freeze fat cells under the skin. Once the fat cells have been destroyed, they are gradually broken down and removed from the body by the liver.

Most CoolSculpting sessions take around an hour and cost about $1,000 per treatment area.

CoolSculping is a fairly new technique, only approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. CoolSculpting and cryolipolysis are registered trademarks of Zeltiq Aesthetics.

While the number of independent, clinical research studies backing the procedure is still relatively small, Zeltiq Aesthetics claim CoolSculpting lowers the amount of fat cells in the treatment area by between 20 and 25 percent.

Most people start to notice the effects a few days after the procedure, but it often takes 1 to 4 months for the full results to show.

What are the risks?



CoolSculpting involves freezing fat cells to contour the body. It is a relatively new procedure. CoolSculpting involves freezing fat cells to contour the body. It is a relatively new procedure.

Although research is still limited, CoolSculpting is generally viewed as a safer, non-invasive type of fat reduction surgery than traditional procedures, such as liposuction.

Most people do not feel anything during the procedure, aside from a tugging sensation where the skin is between the device's two cooling panels.

As the procedure does not involve any cutting, tissue manipulation, or anesthesia, most people do not need any recovery time and can immediately resume normal activities.

The only noticeable side effects of the procedure tend to be minor and occur only around the area of treatment. Most minor side effects reduce or go away within a few days to weeks after the procedure.

It is normal, however, to experience numbness or loss of sensation in the treatment area for around a month.

Common immediate side effects of CoolSculpting include:

redness

firmness

pinching sensation

minor swelling

tenderness

bruising

stinging

tingling

numbness

skin sensitivity

mild to moderate pain

muscle cramping

A person may continue to experience these side effects for a few weeks after the procedure. Other common side effects that a person may experience in the first few weeks after CoolSculpting include:

itchiness, especially a few days after the procedure

diarrhea, as dead fat cells are removed from the body

a feeling of fullness in the throat after treatments involving the neck or chin region

Additional considerations



It is important to choose a plastic surgeon with experience and good patient reviews. It is important to choose a plastic surgeon with experience and good patient reviews.

The risk of side effects and complications often depends on the medical professional performing the procedure.

People should make sure to choose an experienced, trusted professional, such as a dermatologist or plastic surgeon. Individuals can do this by researching local options and asking questions before committing to the procedure.

CoolSculpting is relatively new, and so the full extent of risks, side effects, and complications associated with the procedure is still unknown.

A 2017 study reviewing all available research papers from two major medical research databases found only 319 studies linked to the terms cool sculpting, cryolipolysis, fat freezing, and lipocryolysis.

As it is relatively new, few medical professionals are aware of the procedure, or have much experience with it

CoolSculpting is also only approved and proven effective on a limited number of body areas.

Body regions where CoolSculpting is considered safe and effective for removing minor fat deposits include:

abdomen

thighs

under the chin or upper neck

flanks

under the armpit

back

buttocks and under the buttocks

Who should avoid it?

CoolSculpting is considered a safe, effective way to reduce the number of fat cells in a small target area. It is not considered a form of weight loss and not recommended for the treatment of obesity.

The procedure is designed to help dissolve stubborn fat cells that usually only shrink through diet and exercise.

People with weakened immune systems are not ideal candidates for surgeries such as CoolSculpting. People with certain conditions that weaken or change the body's ability to handle the cold can also experience serious medical complications.

Conditions that rule out the use of CoolSculpting include:

pregnancy, attempting to become pregnant, and breast-feeding

cryoglobulinemia, a disorder where proteins that usually only increase in response to cold are abnormally in high concentrations

cold agglutinin disease, an autoimmune condition where temperature change kills red blood cells

paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, a condition where red blood cells die in response to temperature change

Raynaud's disease

chilblains

reduced circulation or skin sensation at the treatment area

nerve conditions, such as diabetic neuropathy

skin conditions related to the immune system, such as eczema and psoriasis

inflammatory skin conditions, such as dermatitis and hives

a recent injury to the skin area being treated, including scar tissue

long-term use of blood thinning medications

bleeding conditions that thin the blood

history of a hernia or a hernia in or near the treatment area

active, implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers

allergy to propylene glycol or isopropyl alcohol

chronic pain conditions

severe anxiety disorders

What are the rare long-term effects?



Reduced tongue and lip movement, as well as dryness in the mouth, are potential side effects of CoolSculpting on the neck and chin. Reduced tongue and lip movement, as well as dryness in the mouth, are potential side effects of CoolSculpting on the neck and chin.

In some very rare cases, fat cells respond to CoolSculpting by enlarging rather than dying. This condition is called paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH).

A 2014 study reported the incidence of PAH with CoolSculpting is currently thought to be around 0.0051 percent.

Researchers are not sure why PAH occurs, but most people who develop the condition are men. While PAH does not cause any symptoms aside from changing physical appearance, only surgery can reverse it.

Additional rare complications that may occur after CoolSculpting include:

pain that starts several days after the treatment and usually resolves when numbness goes away, or after about a month

scarring or changes to skin color

reduced movement or response of the tongue following procedures involving the neck or chin

lower lip muscle weakness following procedures involving the neck or chin

reduced saliva production and dry mouth following procedures involving the chin or neck

frostbite, or first- and second-degree freeze burns

dizziness, light-headedness, sweating, painting, nausea, and flushing

hyperpigmentation, or dark skin coloration that often resolves on its own

subcutaneous induration, a generalized hardness or specific hard nodules that develop in the treated area and can be painful

abrupt and undesirable changes in fat layering

What are the positive results?

One benefit of CoolSculpting is that, unlike with diet and exercise, fat cells are actually destroyed and removed from the body. This means the same fat cells cannot return, or enlarge with weight gain.

There are several other benefits of CoolSculpting:

It is a low-risk procedure for most people.

The skin barrier is not broken or compromised, removing most of the risk of complications, such as infection and scarring.

There are few reported adverse reactions or outcomes.

There is no need to take time off from work or everyday activities afterward.

The results look natural, as they develop gradually in the weeks following the surgery.

It can help people who have lost weight or at a healthy weight but still have excess fat in particular areas.

There is less risk of regaining weight and results are long-lasting because fat cells are actually destroyed and removed from the body.

The risk of skin dimpling or bumps is low because fat cells are destroyed evenly across a patch of skin.

Overall, the procedure can help boost self-confidence, especially when combined with weight loss achieved through a healthful diet and exercise.

Takeaway

There is not much independent research on CoolSculpting at present. What research exists suggests that it is a low-risk option for removing small amounts of fat that is proving difficult to remove with diet and exercise.

People who are interested in this form of treatment should discuss it first with their doctor. They can help decide whether it is the right option, or if there are more suitable ways for removing unwanted fat.","united states food and drug administration fda

Ana Sandoiu,"Popularly known as the ‘love hormone,’ oxytocin makes dogs ignore threatening cues and focus on your smiling face, according to new research.",2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,'Love hormone' explains why your dog loves to see you smile,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320170.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320170/dog-licking-smiling-owner.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Wild animals have more to gain from watching out for predators than getting all warm and fuzzy when they see a smiling human. But your dog is nothing like any other animal. A new study has revealed that your pet can love you so much that it might even ignore danger to see your smiling face. If you're nice to it.



Oxytocin may be the reason why your dog will always try to make you smile. Oxytocin may be the reason why your dog will always try to make you smile.

How often do you pet your dog? Gaze into its loving eyes? Smile at it? Hopefully, very often, because the more you do it, the more your dog will love you — and new research helps us to understand why.

Every time you gaze lovingly into your dogs' eyes, its levels of oxytocin — the ""attachment hormone"" — go up. And so do yours.

Oxytocin has long been referred to as ""the love hormone"" and the ""cuddle hormone,"" because we (and our pets) release it when we hug, touch, or look lovingly into someone's eyes. This increases our attachment to that person (or animal.)

But researchers already knew this. What they didn't know was that more oxytocin also makes dogs prefer smiling faces over threatening ones — kind of like we do.

This may not sound like much in the human kingdom, but among animals — who have a better chance of survival if they're attuned to threatening cues — it's kind of a big deal.

The new study was led by Prof. Outi Vainio, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, and it was published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.

The findings seem to reinforce a virtuous circle of affection between dogs and humans: the nicer you are to your dog, the more of the love hormone they will secrete. In turn, this will make them love you even more — so much so that they might even ignore danger for your sake.

Oxytocin makes dogs love your smile

In case you're wondering how researchers could tell what a dog feels, the answer is pretty specific: by measuring the size of their pupils.

""We were among the first researchers in the world to use pupil measurements in the evaluation of dogs' emotional states,"" says Prof. Vainio. ""This method had previously only been used on humans and apes.""

Larger pupils indicated higher emotional arousal. The researchers administered oxytocin nasally to the dogs, and, using an eye-tracking device, they examined both the size of the dogs' pupils as well as the direction of their gaze.

They did so twice for each dog: once after they received oxytocin, and once without the hormone.

By default, dogs tend to focus more on the most salient aspects of a social situation — such as frightening cues in a dangerous situation. However, oxytocin seemed to make them override this survival instinct; dogs that received oxytocin were far more interested in smiling human faces than threatening ones.

This was backed by their emotional response, which was also altered. Without the hormone, they responded emotionally more to angry faces — their pupils dilated more — while when they were under the influence of oxytocin, they responded more to smiling faces.

As the authors explain, this probably means that oxytocin makes angry faces look less threatening and smiling faces more attractive. Both of these signs indicate a higher pro-social behavior.

""Both effects,"" says Prof. Vainio, ""promote dog-human communication and the development of affectionate relations.""

""It seems that the hormone oxytocin influences what the dog sees and how it experiences the thing it sees,"" adds doctoral student and first study author Sanni Somppi. And when that thing is your smiling face, your dog most probably loves it.","university of helsinki

"Debra Sullivan, PhD, MSN, RN, CNE, COI",The signs and symptoms of menopause and pregnancy can be similar. We take a look at how to determine if you are pregnant or approaching menopause.,2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Menopause or pregnant: What are the signs?,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320137.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320137/smiling-middle-aged-lady.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Asking if your symptoms could mean menopause or pregnancy is becoming a more frequent question, with some women going through menopause early in life and others conceiving later than was once the case.

Many people will have heard a story about a woman who thought she was going through menopause but found out she was pregnant instead. This kind of surprise can undoubtedly cause great shock, which is why it is essential to understand the differences and similarities between the two conditions.

In this article, we look at the signs and symptoms of both menopause and pregnancy, and how to distinguish one from the other.

How to tell if you are approaching menopause



Some pregnancy symptoms could be mistaken for perimenopause. Some pregnancy symptoms could be mistaken for perimenopause.

Menopause is the time in a woman's life when she no longer has menstrual periods. It is a stage that occurs when her body stops making so much of the hormones estrogen and progesterone.

Doctors consider a woman to be in menopause when she has not had any menstrual bleeding, even spotting, for 12 consecutive months.

Before menopause, women typically go through a transition period called perimenopause. During this time, a woman may notice that her periods start to change in regularity, duration, and by the amount of bleeding.

According to the United States Office on Women's Health, most women start perimenopause in their mid- to late-40s and may experience perimenopause for between 2 to 8 years.

Symptoms of menopause

In addition to changes in her periods, a woman may experience other signs of menopause. These include:

hot flashes, or sudden feelings of extreme heat, causing discomfort and sweating

difficulty sleeping well

mood swings

increased frequency of urination and urinary tract infections

vaginal dryness that may make sex uncomfortable

lack of interest in sex

Symptoms of pregnancy

Many symptoms of menopause are similar to those of pregnancy.

When a woman is pregnant, she will not have a period but may experience some light spotting that could be mistaken for a period. Many pregnant women also experience mood swings and problems sleeping.

Other symptoms associated with pregnancy include:

fatigue

headaches

nausea or vomiting, especially in the mornings

having to use the bathroom more frequently

tender, swollen breasts

Because many of these symptoms are similar to those of menopause, it is possible that a woman could think she is pregnant while she is, in fact, going through menopause, and vice versa.

How are both conditions diagnosed?

There are a variety of ways a woman can identify if she is pregnant or going through menopause.

Diagnosing pregnancy



Carrying out an ultrasound is the most reliable way to test for pregnancy. Carrying out an ultrasound is the most reliable way to test for pregnancy.

If a woman suspects she may be pregnant, she can choose to purchase a home pregnancy test from a drugstore.

These tests measure the levels of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a woman's urine.

hCG is typically present in more significant amounts when a woman is pregnant. It is important to remember that these home pregnancy tests are not 100 percent accurate.

For more accuracy, a doctor can perform blood tests to measure the raised levels of the hormones associated with pregnancy, such as hCG and progesterone.

However, the most definitive way to test if a woman is pregnant is for a doctor to perform an ultrasound and test for the presence of a fetal heartbeat. An ultrasound uses sound waves to detect the presence of a fetus.

Diagnosing menopause

Perimenopause and menopause can sometimes be difficult for doctors to diagnose.

Doctors can test for the presence of hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, which typically decrease when a woman is going through menopause. However, these hormones naturally change throughout each month, so a test result showing low or high hormone levels does not always mean a woman is experiencing menopause.

To be sure that a woman is in menopause, a doctor will likely consider all of the symptoms she has been experiencing, including changes in her periods. The doctor may also perform blood tests to identify hormone levels.

A doctor may not be able to predict when a woman's periods will stop altogether.

Next steps for menopause

If a woman is in menopause, there are several steps she can take to stay healthy. These include:

Eating a healthful diet

A woman should eat lots of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and low-fat dairy. She should also include plenty of calcium and vitamin D, as these are associated with strong bones. Estrogen decreases during menopause, which can cause bones to become less dense than they once were.

Exercising

Exercise helps to relieve stress, keep muscles strong, and the heart healthy.

Exercise does not have to be overly strenuous to be effective. Walking, cycling, or participating in an exercise class, such as aerobics, for 30 minutes daily, are all examples of good exercise habits.

Seeing a doctor for regular check-ups

Yearly checkups can help a doctor identify any health issues or treatments a woman may need when she is experiencing menopause. As a general rule, the earlier any problem is diagnosed, the more effective the treatment.

Taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

Some women may also opt to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during or after menopause. HRT can reduce some of the symptoms associated with menopause but may have adverse side effects.

Among the issues to be aware of is that HRT can increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.

All women considering HRT should look at the pros and cons with their doctor first.

Next steps for pregnancy



During pregnancy, it is essential to drink plenty of water to keep both mother and baby hydrated. During pregnancy, it is essential to drink plenty of water to keep both mother and baby hydrated.

Doctors consider pregnant women who are 35 years of age or older, as of ""advanced maternal age.""

A global study published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, found that around 12.3 percent of pregnant women fitted into this category.

Regardless of age, there are some steps a woman can take to promote a healthy pregnancy for herself and her baby. They include:

Changing lifestyle habits : Pregnant women should avoid habits that include smoking, using illegal drugs, and drinking excessive amounts of alcohol that can cause birth abnormalities or other fetal problems.

Reviewing medication : A pregnant woman may wish to review any medications she is taking with her doctor, to ensure they are safe during pregnancy.

: A pregnant woman may wish to review any medications she is taking with her doctor, to ensure they are safe during pregnancy. Eating a healthful diet : Pregnant women should eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Many doctors recommend that pregnant women should avoid sushi and other raw meats, deli meat, high-mercury fish, raw shellfish, raw eggs, and unpasteurized milk because they may increase risks of complications for the baby.

: Rest is important to help a pregnant woman keep her energy levels intact. Drinking plenty of water: A woman's blood volume increases dramatically during her pregnancy, which means she needs plenty of water to keep her and her baby hydrated. As a general rule, if a woman's urine is pale yellow, she is well-hydrated.

A woman should make an appointment with a doctor who specializes in the care of pregnant women, known as an obstetrician, according to her doctor's advice. Regular prenatal care can help a doctor identify and anticipate potential birth complications.

Outlook

Because pregnant women and women who are going through menopause experience many similar symptoms, it can sometimes be difficult to identify which condition is which.

So, any woman who is not sure what her symptoms mean should speak to a doctor for advice or have further tests.","international journal of obstetrics gynaecology

Honor Whiteman,"Researchers reveal how two drugs used to treat malaria, called chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, could help in the fight against cancer.",2017-11-24T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Malaria drugs could help to combat cancer,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320166.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/headlines/320/320166/dividing-cancer-cells.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that are used to treat malaria, but a new review suggests that they may have another purpose: treating cancer.



Two antimalarial medications could also help to treat cancer, a new review suggests. Two antimalarial medications could also help to treat cancer, a new review suggests.

The research — which reviewed more than 190 studies investigating how chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) affect cancer cells — describes how the malaria drugs may increase tumor sensitivity to existing cancer treatments.

Based on their findings, first study author Ciska Verbaanderd, from the University of Leuven in Belgium, and her colleagues say that the drugs ""deserve further clinical investigations in several cancer types.""

The review was recently published in the journal ecancermedicalscience.

While the United States has seen a fall in cancer death rates in recent years, the disease remains a significant burden on public health. Last year, there were more than 1.6 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. and more than 595,000 cancer deaths.

Given that cancer is increasingly becoming resistant to existing therapies, there is a desperate need to uncover new ways to fight the disease.

Verbaanderd and colleagues believe that the drugs CQ and HCQ could help in this fight.

CQ and HCQ as cancer therapies

CQ and HCQ are medications used to prevent and treat malaria. They may also be used in the treatment of lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. A wealth of research, however, has suggested that these drugs may also have anti-cancer properties.

For their review, Verbaanderd and colleagues analyzed the results of more than 190 animal and human studies that assessed the effects of CQ and HCQ on different types of cancer.

According to the researchers, the aim of their review was ""to inform further research and trials on repurposing CQ and HCQ as anti-cancer agents.""

The team uncovered evidence to suggest that CQ and HCQ could be effective for the treatment of a number of cancers, including glioblastoma — which is a deadly brain cancer — lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer.

""CQ and HCQ have been studied in multiple preclinical cancer models,"" write the authors, ""and have demonstrated activity on several cancer-supporting pathways and in combination with a broad range of other therapies.""

""[...] The majority of these studies have reported an improved therapeutic efficacy as compared with monotherapy with existing anti-cancer drugs,"" they add.

The review also indicates that both drugs are ""safe and tolerable"" as an anti-cancer therapy, though current evidence suggests that HCQ might pose fewer side effects.

How can CQ and HCQ fight cancer?

According to the team, their review highlights a number of mechanisms by which CQ and HCQ could help to treat cancer.

Firstly, there is evidence to suggest that the drugs can inhibit autophagy, which is the process whereby cells devour their own damaged or unnecessary components.

""Autophagic properties such as nutrient recycling can support cancer cell survival,"" the authors note. ""Moreover, key regulators of cell growth can be degraded and the DNA damage response can be suppressed through increased autophagy.""

""Therefore, inhibition of autophagy can be an interesting anti-cancer strategy when cancer cells start depending on autophagy for survival.""

The review also revealed that CQ and HCQ can block the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway, which previous research has associated with cancer progression.

Additionally, there is evidence that CQ can stabilize a protein called p53, which is a known tumor suppressor, and it may also help to normalize blood vessel dysfunction in tumors.

""The benefits of vessel normalization include a decrease in tumor hypoxia, reduced cancer cell intravasation and metastasis, and an increase in chemotherapeutic drug delivery and response,"" the authors explain.

Drugs could offer 'significant clinical benefit'

Overall, Verbaanderd and colleagues believe that their study has highlighted the potential benefits of CQ and HCQ as a cancer treatment, as well as the mechanisms behind their anti-cancer properties.

""The results from the review lead us to believe that these antimalarial drugs could offer significant clinical benefit for certain cancer patients, especially in combination with standard anti-cancer treatments. This should be confirmed by additional clinical results."" Ciska Verbaanderd

The team notes that there are 30 clinical trials currently investigating the effects of CQ and HCQ against various cancer types.

Based on their review, the researchers conclude that these trials should focus on the efficacy of these medications, as well as the best doses and methods of administration.","ecancermedicalscience

It can have several underlying causes, it is more common in older people, and women tend to develop it more frequently than men.

In this article, we take a look at the symptoms and causes of polyarthralgia, as well as the treatment options available for the condition.

Symptoms



Polyarthralgia may cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in multiple joints. Polyarthralgia may cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in multiple joints.

Polyarthralgia is a non-inflammatory condition that can have several symptoms, including:

joint pain

joint tenderness

stiffness of the joints

swelling of the joints

limited joint movement

weakness

fatigue

How painful the joints feel will also depend on the person's emotional state and pain tolerance.

Differences with other types of arthralgia, arthritis, and polymyalgia

Although sharing some similarities, polyarthralgia differs from other inflammatory and non-inflammatory pain syndromes in the following ways:

arthralgia affects one joint instead of several joints

arthritis pain is associated with joint inflammation, which is absent in arthralgia and polyarthralgia

polyarthritis pain is also associated with joint inflammation and usually affects five or more joints

oligoarthritis or oligoarticular disease affects two to four joints

osteoarthritis causes pain in the joints of the knee, hips, and hands

myalgia refers to muscle pain with no signs of inflammation

polymyalgia is muscle pain that affects several muscles

Causes and risk factors



A sedentary lifestyle, performing repetitive actions, and previous joint injuries may all increase the risk of devloping polyarthralgia. A sedentary lifestyle, performing repetitive actions, and previous joint injuries may all increase the risk of devloping polyarthralgia.

Polyarthralgia can have several causes, which may include the following:

injuries and fractures

infections caused by a virus

certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus

bursitis, the swelling and irritation of the fluid-filled cushion between muscles, tendons, and bones

tendinitis, which is the swelling or inflammation of tendons

excessive use and effort of the joints

osteoarthritis

osteomyelitis, a bone infection caused by bacteria or other germs

septic arthritis, which is inflammation of the joints due to a bacterial or fungal infection

A person may have increased risk for polyarthralgia if they:

are overweight

have a sedentary, inactive lifestyle

have a physically demanding job

have a job that involves repetitive actions

have had a previous joint injury

are female

are an older person

Diagnosis

The medical diagnosis of polyarthralgia includes an initial evaluation of the person by the doctor. This evaluation usually includes looking at the person's medical history and a physical examination. It may also include specific tests and imaging techniques.

When looking at the person's medical history, the doctor may ask questions such as whether the pain appeared after an injury, or whether there is a family history of joint disease.

Physical examination typically includes inspection, feeling the joints, checking their range of motion, and specific tests. The doctor will likely try to work out the exact location of the pain and which joints were affected first.

Laboratory testing may be required to help make a diagnosis. This may include blood tests to check for the following:

rheumatoid factor

erythrocyte sedimentation rate

uric acid

C-reactive protein

antinuclear antibodies

A doctor may perform an arthrocentesis, a procedure to remove fluid from the joints, which will relieve the pain. Analysis of the fluid will also give the doctor a clearer view of the medical condition causing the problem.

Finally, imaging techniques can also be used to help diagnosis. Methods may include radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) scans.

CT scans may be performed in combination with a dye injection to give a better view of the cartilage, ligaments, and the tissue surrounding the joint.

Treatment

Treatment of polyarthralgia can involve medication or medication-free strategies. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, promote healing, and allow the joints to continue to work properly.

Medication



A warm bath may help to relax the joints, and is an alternative treatment method to taking medication. A warm bath may help to relax the joints, and is an alternative treatment method to taking medication.

Several medications are available that can help to control the pain and relieve joint swelling.

In cases of moderate to severe joint pain, doctors frequently prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.

Studies have shown that both treatments are similarly effective, although COX-2 inhibitors cause fewer side effects in the gut.

Acetaminophen may be used to relieve joint soreness in cases of mild pain.

Medication-free strategies

Several interventions and lifestyle changes are encouraged to protect and strengthen the joint.

Doctors and physical therapists may recommend moderate physical exercises, such as walking, swimming, and stationary cycling. These activities do not place too much weight on the joints and help to reduce stress on them.

Other suggestions include:

resting the joints

eating a healthful diet to lose or maintain weight

taking warm baths

having massages

doing stretching exercises

Changing simple daily habits, such as adopting a better posture in everyday life, can relieve joint pain and help a person to cope with it.

Keeping the joint still in the short term can be helpful for pain control and protection. However, long periods without moving the joint can lead to joint stiffness and loss of movement. Ideally, try moving the joint gently without applying any weight.

Physical therapists may provide other alternatives and specific techniques to help manage and control pain, including using ultrasound, electrical currents, heat, cold, skin irritants, and electrical nerve stimulation.

Outlook

Polyarthralgia is a medical condition of painful joints with no evidence of inflammation. It can have several causes, often only lasts for a short time, and does not require immediate treatment.

Several actions can be taken to limit and relieve pain. Depending on its severity, people can take pain medications such as opioids and NSAIDs.

Education and lifestyle changes can also be used to ensure that daily activities are pain-free and to maintain a good quality of life.","polyarthralgia polyarthralgia

His footage of the harrowing process, posted to Facebook, has drawn millions of views.

The wasps audibly pelt the camera lens, sounding like rain, as professional bee remover Verret walks toward the nest. The buzzing activity ramps up as he dismantles what he calls ""the granddaddy of hornet’s nests.""

In the video, the nest looks like a large pile of dirt or cardboard. In fact, hornets build their nests by chewing wood into a papery construction pulp. There are about 20 different types of species—in North America, the European hornet is common. The European hornet belongs to a family of wasps that includes all yellowjackets.

Verret, who is also a beekeeper, usually gets stung doing work like this, he told the The Times-Picayune, but ""this time, no, I lucked out."" Verret, who was covered from head to foot in protective gear, said on YouTube the removal took about 45 minutes.

Hornets can be deadly—a series of attacks by the Asian giant hornet in northwestern China in 2013 killed at least 42 people and injured many others.

More often, however, hornets end up on the losing side when their nests are poisoned or destroyed, as happens in the video from Louisiana.

Nests like this can be terrifying, especially to people with sting allergies. Verret said the nest contained southern yellowjackets, telling the Times-Picayune, ""There's nothing good about them, I don't think.""","european hornet

In his new book, The Animals Among Us, Bradshaw now demolishes a few myths about the pets that increasingly crowd our homes. [Find out if your dog would eat you if you died.]

Speaking from his home in Southampton, England, Bradshaw explains why most scientists didn’t consider the bond between humans and their pets an important area of research; why women of the Awa-Gauja tribe in the Amazon breastfeed monkeys; and why having an animal in the house is so important, especially for kids whose world has increasingly been reduced to a smartphone screen. [Discover why your dog eats poop.]

One of the myths you question is that keeping pets is good for us. I think most pet owners know they are!

Initial research showed that people with pets survived longer after heart attacks than people without pets. The most likely explanation is that these were people who, other than having a heart attack, were in a better state of health than people who did not or could not have pets for a variety of reasons.

This has been borne out recently in studies by the Rand Corporation, which looked at large samples of people from California. They showed that pet keeping is practiced by people who can afford it, not just in financial terms but also in terms of lifestyle. People who are settled, have children, who live in a house rather than an apartment, and—to put it bluntly—are white have better health. But it’s not because of the pets. The pet is the consequence of the healthy life, not the cause of it.

Other assumptions you question are whether animals can feel embarrassment or guilt, and whether their minds are capable of deliberate planning. I think if you saw our Dalmatian’s face after he has been bad—or when he is carefully planning his escape from the yard—you might reconsider!

[Laughs] Yes, I can see that. People do interpret these behaviors as if they are intentional. The question is, what kinds of emotions do they feel? Alexandra Horowitz in New York showed that the guilty look is actually a sign of the dog’s very acute ability to read human body language.

Dogs put the guilty look on almost before the owner knows it’s time to get angry about something the dog has done. They almost seem to react as fast as our conscious minds can. As soon as you look at the dog, the dog is already looking guilty.

You make the assumption that the dog was looking guilty before you looked at it. But the science shows that the dog doesn’t start looking guilty until the moment the owner’s body language is visible to it. You don't have to say anything. It can be just a slight stiffening in posture.

Dog Facial Expressions Change When Watched By Humans A new study shows that when given human attention, dogs will produce a wider range of facial expressions. Click here to read Dogs Show 'Sad Puppy Face' More Often When Being Watched.

So, what kind of mental abilities do you need to feel guilt? In our human terms, guilt is quite sophisticated. You have to compare something you have done at some point in the past with some internal norm, which you have learned over the course of a long period of time. There’s no evidence that the canine mind can do that.

I am not saying that dogs are stupid. Their minds are very good at doing what they do. They can react more quickly to human body language than humans can. But we anthropomorphize, assuming they emotionalize identically to us, and that’s the mistake.

As for deliberate planning, there’s also been a lot of research but not so much into dogs. The problem is making comparisons between animals. Although we all have a vertebrate, mammalian brain, the details of the construction are quite different. The cerebral cortex, the bit we do most of our thinking with, is reduced in dogs. They rely a lot more on smell, decoding odors. They do have a limited ability to plan, if they’ve encountered a particular situation before. But they can’t imagine themselves into a situation they’ve never been in.

You helped coin the term “anthrozoology.” Explain what it means—and why it was needed.

It’s the study of human-animal interactions. It is an evolved word that started with a journal at Tufts University, in Boston, about five years before we founded the society with the same name. It was necessary to have a word to describe what we were doing because it wasn’t conventional zoology.

At the time, in the 1990s, zoologists who worked on domesticated animals, like I did, were regarded as an inferior race. [Laughs] So the few of us who were interested in these things decided we would form a society to bring the various disparate threads together, from zoology, psychology, and other sciences. You can now get degrees in anthrozoology in quite a number of countries, including the UK and the United States. It’s taken shape more than we thought it might even 25 years ago.

In some societies, women breastfed animals. What purpose did this have?

The Awa Guaja are a matriarchal society, and monkeys are taken from the wild and given to the women. The men are generally the ones who kill the baby monkey’s mother. The babies are then brought back, breastfed and then fed on pre-chewed food and eventually fruit and nuts. They are a status symbol. The head woman, the matriarch of the village, is allowed to have the most monkeys. They drape themselves over her head and shoulders, like a badge of office.

In Japan, there is a tradition among the Ainu people, whereby women breastfeed bear cubs as part of a status-building exercise. Their family would go out at the beginning of spring when adult female bears are coming out of hibernation and have cubs with them, and take the cubs away. The cubs have not been weaned at this point, so they have to be fed on milk, and they’re breast fed because that’s part of the ritual. Later, there is a bear meat feast where these bears are killed and the surrogate human mothers get very upset. It’s not clear from the accounts whether they are genuinely upset or if it’s just part of the ritual. I suspect it’s partly both.

You write that “pets are, to a certain extent, imaginary constructions,” and that the idea of animals being “heroes” is misleading. I know a lot of people won’t agree with that idea, so can you explain it for us?

There are a number of concepts in there. The one I object to is the idea that an animal can be a hero. Heroism is a fairly doubtful concept even in human terms. Why do people sacrifice themselves for the greater good? It’s easy enough to rationalize it after the event. In the heat of the moment, that’s not something I’m qualified to talk about. But it’s not as altruistic as we make it seem to be afterwards.

To be a hero, if there is such a thing, an animal would have to consciously give up something and put itself at risk in a situation where it knows it’s at risk. I don’t think that any of the animals that have been given awards show this.

They’ve been put at risk by their human handlers—not deliberately of course. They went with their handler to a place where the handler was attacked and the dog did what it was trained to do: defend the handler. The dog wasn’t doing that because it had some greater good in the back of its mind. No dog’s mind thinks like that.

To some degree, our minds turn everything we see into an imaginary construction. What we’re doing with pets is mainly an anthropomorphic arrangement. We tend to imagine that they have thoughts and intentions rather like ours, but are just not able to express them quite as well as we can. This is an important part of the human mind. We like to project our minds onto everything. That includes our pets!

Do you have pets, John? If so, tell us about them and what they have taught you?

Not at the moment. I have a grandson who’s very allergic and so we’re having a break. But I’ve had pets for 40-plus years, ever since I was a student. That said, I’m not really any more of a pet enthusiast than the average family man. I’m a biologist who studies pets.

I’ve had a succession of dogs who’ve taught me a great deal about what it’s like to be a dog. I’ve had a succession of cats that have lived in the house, bred, and raised their kittens, so I’ve experienced and enjoyed the whole life span for both species. This has taught me how different these two animals are. Above all, my pets have taught me the individuality of animals and how, if possible, we should treat and think about them as individuals.

Hopefully, for the sake of the animals, our understanding in the future will be tempered by better knowledge of what the animal is imagining about us, which may be quite different to what we think it might be. The research is not finished by any means, but so far there has been no indication that dogs think about us. But they are capable of thinking that we think about them. [Laughs]

They interpret our behavior in quite a sophisticated way. But what scientists have yet to get to grips with is what kinds of rules they use to interpret our behavior.

What doesn’t seem to be the case is that they know what we’re thinking. It’s much more about being able to analyze what we’re doing on a microsecond basis, compare that with a data bank of what’s happened in the past, and react very quickly. This convinces us that they know what we’re thinking when, in fact, they may not at all.

I do think having animals around is essential but until I started doing research, I didn’t know why. It was something I just felt, and a lot of other people feel, that you are somehow a lesser person without this kind of contact.

I don’t distinguish—and most research has borne this out—between pet animals and wild animals. It’s just that pet animals are much more accessible. Contact with wild animals, whether a bird table or feeding a hedgehog in the back garden, is all part of the same thing as having a pet.

Having a pet in the house teaches us what animals are, in a way that watching a cute puppy or kitten video on YouTube does not, especially for kids. It teaches them about animals and the reality of what biology is. So many other things in our lives are being reduced to what we can see and do on a screen. Animals are a healthy antidote to all that.

Sarah Gibbens,"These millipedes move in groups that are so close-knit, they stumble over each other to crawl forward in unison.",2017-11-24T12:00:00Z,national-geographic,Watch Swarms of Millipedes Join Ranks to Survive,https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/swarming-millipedes-video-senegal-spd.html,https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/84/98/smpost_1511367071031.jpg,science-and-nature,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Watch Swarms of Millipedes Join Ranks to Survive

When a squishy, lone baby millipede travels alone, it's a vulnerable target. But in a swarm surrounded by its siblings, it stands a better chance of surviving.

Millipedes are a diverse group of arthropods that can be found around the globe. Some species swarm together during mating season or to hunt for food, and some studies have theorized juveniles swarm together for protection from predators. (See how sawfly larvae deploy similar lines of defense.)

Noah Elhardt works at a farmer training center in Senegal, where he recently stumbled upon one such swarm this past September. A nature photographer by hobby, Elhardt decided to film the swarms of millipedes he observed clustered on many of the country's roads.

""While migrating, the swarms often become two or three millipedes deep, so that the individuals on top are propelled along as if walking on a moving sidewalk at an airport,"" he said.

From the ground, it's easy to see the large clusters of 20 to 30 millipedes crawling over each other as they move forward. The ranks are so impenetrable that when a single ant tries to pass through, it stumbles until it's forced to crawl around the sides.

Millipedes are born in clusters that hatch at the same time. They stick together from day one. A similar cluster of millipedes can be seen in the video, only slightly larger than the juvenile patch, lingering only a few inches away.

According to Elhardt, the millipedes are likely feeding on the nutrient-rich patches of soil that spring to life during Senegal's rainy season. Juvenile millipedes can't subsist on dirt alone, so they seek out patches of soil that is covered in organic matter. Because this organic matter typically grows in patches that are exposed to sunlight, young millipedes are more exposed.

While a swarm of ants, for example, is barred by these millipede clusters, the group of young juveniles deploys a different mechanism if it fears the presence of a large predator.","photographer

Jane C. Timm,Pennsylvania has overhauled its criminal and mental health records reporting for the last six years in order to improve its background check system.,2017-11-25T09:44:07Z,nbc-news,How Pennsylvania created a model gun background check system,http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/how-pennsylvania-created-model-gun-background-check-system-n822026,https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/2231201/171117-gun-shop-ac-633p_01e1b9cb711d9437c7c0aa853ede1d9c.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"When the eviction of a Pennsylvania man with a documented history of mental health issues turned into a deadly shootout, police realized they'd found another gap in a system they'd already spent years working to improve. How had the man, Donald Meyer Jr., passed the state's background check?

State police investigated and found that the record of the man's involuntary mental health commitment — which should have barred him from buying weapons — had been lost in transit between the county and state. In response, the state created an audit system to prevent future errors.

As federal lawmakers seek to improve record reporting to the federal background check system after a Texas massacre highlighted the risks of missing records, Pennsylvania offers a potential roadmap: The state has spent the last six years aggressively overhauling records reporting, hunting down reporting gaps like the one that let Meyer buy a gun and modernizing the technology they use to keep guns out of the wrong hands.

“We can’t afford to make a mistake. We’ve got to find these errors and find these vulnerabilities,” Major Scott Price, director of the Pennsylvania State Police’s Bureau of Records and Identification, told NBC News.

Over the last six years, police have upgraded the Pennsylvania Instant Check System’s (PICS) technology and system processes and hunted down gaps in record reporting. Price said that they have received $2 million in federal grants to fund their efforts, but also funded significant reforms themselves.

“The PICS system is strong — it’s a model for this country. Every state should strive to do as well in record reporting as they do,” said William Rosen, the deputy legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that advocates stricter gun control.

Background checks for gun sellers are far from simple: An inquiry goes by phone or computer to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which searches itself and two databases, the Interstate Identification Index, where criminal histories are stored, and the National Crime Information Center, which houses warrants and protection orders.

Those three systems house records from countless agencies on the local, state, and federal level. Thirteen states run their own background check systems, too, housing state records and submitting copies to the federal systems, according to FBI. Seven states run background checks for certain kinds of weapons, leaving the rest to the FBI.

Some checks are instant, while others flag potential prohibitive records but require FBI investigators to do more research. It's a lot of moving parts, and it's got to move quickly. If a background check is incomplete after 72 hours, the law says the gun seller can complete the sale without the final results.

Rosen was quick to note that when the records are properly entered, the system works well. It’s stopped 3 million gun sales to individuals barred from owning a weapon since its inception in 1998.

“The system is intricate, but the solution is simple: remove any barriers, make sure that your records get into the system,” he told NBC News.

The barriers to getting the right records in the right place vary from state to state, but include privacy concerns over mental health records, the intricacies of firearm and criminal law and technological abilities. The Justice Department has ordered a review of the nation's background check system, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), aimed at identifying and resolving records reporting issues at all levels of government, as well as within the military.

Price said the biggest barrier to more accurate record keeping in Pennsylvania is the differences between state and federal laws.

A domestic violence conviction anywhere in the U.S. bars gun ownership, but Pennsylvania doesn't have a specific misdemeanor charge for domestic violence. This makes tracking which misdemeanor offenses meet the federal qualifications of domestic violence — which requires that the assailant and victim live together, have a child together, or are married — difficult. Next year, Price said the state and local police will begin a process, thanks to a $1.3 million federal grant, to collect more information like the relationship of victim and assailant on their fingerprint cards to make accurate reporting much easier.

When it comes to mental health records, Price said the question of how certain involuntary mental health commitments — like the ones done by a concerned family member, instead of a judge — jived with federal law, left them in limbo: Would they be enough to bar a gun sale? The issue was settled in 2013 (all of the state's involuntary mental health commitments were enough to block a gun sale) and the state transferred 643,167 mental health records into the federal system. In the four years since, Price said they’ve added around 200,000 more mental health records to the federal background check system.

According to the National Shooting Sport's Foundation's FixNICS campaign, the state has submitted the most mental health records per capita of any state in the country as of the end of 2016, the most recent data available.

“When we looked at this issue in 2011, Pennsylvania was one of the worst. … They hadn’t submitted a single mental health record,” Rosen said. “By the time we circled back in 2014, they were the best state in the country with hundreds of thousands of records in the system.”","national crime information center

At least 27 children were among the dead and another 128 people were wounded after militants opened fire on unsuspecting worshipers who had gathered at the al-Rawdah mosque for Friday prayers, Egyptian chief prosecutor Nabil Sadeq said Saturday.

The attack offered the latest sign that, despite more than three years of fighting in Sinai, the Egyptian government has failed to deter an insurgency led by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi vowed that the attack ""will not go unpunished"" and that Egypt would persevere with its war on terrorism, but he did not specify what new steps might be taken.

He ordered Saturday for a mausoleum to be built in memory of the victims of the attack.

The militants, estimated to be a group of 25 to 30, arrived in SUVs Friday wielding machine guns. They positioned themselves at the entrance and at the mosque's 12 windows before firing indiscriminately into the crowd, Sadeq said in a statement.

The imam had barely made it into the pulpit to deliver his sermon when the gunfire rang out, Sadeq added. Mass panic then ensued as worshipers desperately looked for a way to escape.

Mohamed Salah, a local teacher, said he lost more than 20 friends, colleagues, students and relatives in the attack. He spent most of the day on Friday and Saturday in hospitals aiding victims and hearing their stories.

They told him that masked men in military fatigues carrying black ISIS flags exited four cars and began firing automatic weapons indiscriminately and threw hand grenades into the mosque.

""They came from different directions and sprayed bullets with automatic weapons. Whoever fled outside they killed,"" Salah said he was told. ""The whole thing lasted 45 minutes to an hour. It's a real massacre. The mosque was filled with bodies, blood and blood on the carpets. And in the hospital there are people in bad shape.""

Witnesses told Reuters that the militants kept firing as people tried to flee, shooting at ambulances and setting fire to cars to block roads. Images on state media showed bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the mosque.

""When the shooting began everyone was running, and everyone was bumping into one another,"" Magdy Rezk, a wounded survivor, told the news agency from his hospital bed. ""But I was able to make out masked men wearing military clothing.""

Another witness, Mohammed Ali, told The Associated Press that 18 members of his extended family were killed in the attack.

""Where was the army? It's only a few kilometers away. This is the question we cannot find an answer to,"" he said.

The attackers brandished the black flag of ISIS, the chief prosecutor said.

“ Where was the army? … This is the question we cannot find an answer to.”

The attack targeted a mosque frequented by Sufis, members of a mystic movement within Islam. Islamic militants, including the local affiliate of ISIS, consider Sufis heretics because of their less literal interpretations of the faith.

""They threatened it before,"" Salah said, referring to ISIS. ""This is a well-known Sufi mosque. They (the members of the mosque) told the army (about the threat). It's known that after Friday prayer they have dinner together and socialize.""

The military is known to maintain numerous checkpoints in the area, and Salah said anyone going to the mosque would have likely had to pass through one.

No one claimed responsibility for the massacre but the ISIS group affiliate has targeted Sufis in the past.

The ministry of defense said Saturday that it was continuing to search for the perpetrators of the attack and released videos purporting to show Egyptian airstrikes targeting militants' weapons and ammunition stores.

The military also said it had targeted several vehicles in which some of the culprits of the attack were traveling, according to the AP. All passengers of the vehicles were killed, it added.

NBC News could not verify these accounts.

The military and security forces have already been waging a tough campaign against militants in the towns, villages and desert mountains of Sinai, and Egypt has been in a state of emergency since April.

Across the country, thousands have been arrested in a crackdown on suspected Islamists as well as against other dissenters and critics, raising concerns about human rights violations.

Seeking to spread the violence, militants over the past year have carried out deadly bombings on churches in the capital of Cairo and other cities, killing dozens of Christians.

The ISIS affiliate is also believed to be behind the 2016 downing of a Russian passenger jet that killed 226 people over Sinai.

But last week, more than 200 American and Serbian paratroopers leapt from two U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft together, painting dark dots onto a grey November sky.

In the late 1990s, U.S. aircraft targeted Serb forces as part of NATO's military intervention in the Balkans. This time, troops from both sides took selfies with each other and used parachutes provided by the Pentagon.

“We have that special brother bond,"" Spc. Jacob Hanner, 21, from the U.S. Army’s 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry, told NBC News. ""We are actually family, jumping together, no matter what nation we jump with.""

Embed U.S., Serbian paratroopers train together at base once bombed by NATO 1:19 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

Dubbed ""Double Eagle,"" the exercise was the most extensive joint training between the countries in more than 10 years.

NATO remains deeply unpopular among Serbians, following the alliance's 1999 intervention in Kosovo which was aimed at driving our Serbian forces and stopping the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians.

It was American bombers that led the deadly airstrikes during the NATO campaign, killing more than 1,200 people including up to 500 civilians, according to Human Rights Watch. NATO's actions were widely regarded in Serbia as unjust.

'Serbs like Putin'

Opinion polls suggest most Serbians publicly favor military cooperation with Russia. Serbia was formerly part of communist Yugoslavia and Belgrade has long maintained strong ties with the Kremlin. And like Russia, Serbia is an Orthodox Christian and Slavic nation.

Dejan Garic Vladimir Banic / for NBC News

However, Serbia prides itself on officially being a neutral country.

A survey by research company Faktor Plus last month found that more than half of Serbians believe that good relations with Moscow would guarantee the country's security.

Dejan Garic agrees. The 42-year-old sells souvenir T-shirts featuring Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Serbian capital.

""If it's not possible to stay this way, we should choose to be on the Russian side,"" he said. ""I think that Serbs like Putin. If he was in power in 1999, Serbia would never have been bombed by NATO.""

In October, Russia donated six MiG-29 fighter jets to Serbia, which are stationed at Batajnica Air Base — a site that was part of the recent ""Double Eagle"" drills with U.S. forces. The base was also heavily damaged by NATO strikes during the Kosovo conflict.

Serbia applied for European Union membership in 2009, a lengthy process with no clear timeline. Its government has repeatedly stressed that joining the 28-member bloc is the country's most important foreign policy goal.

“We need to give a clear message that the E.U. is in the interest of all of us, that it is a strategic priority for all of us,” Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said during a visit to Brussels this month.

The E.U. is Serbia’s largest trading partner and investor. While Russia controls Serbia’s oil and gas supplies, it trails the E.U. by a factor of 10 in terms of Belgrade’s foreign trade and investment.

U.S. officials insist that Washington is ""not asking Serbia to choose between the European Union and Russia.""

""We strongly support Serbia on its path to the European Union, and we do not believe that excludes good relations with Russia,"" U.S. Ambassador to Serbia, Kyle Scott, said in an interview with Novi Magazin, a Serbian-language weekly publication.

But during a visit to Belgrade in October, State Department official Hoyt Brian Yee hinted that Serbia may have to choose between the West and Russia at some point.

“You cannot sit on two chairs at the same time, especially if they are that far apart,” Yee said.

NATO neighbors

The Faktor Plus poll suggested that Serbians believe the country’s path to E.U. membership is widely regarded as “too slow and uncertain for many people,” according to Vladimir Pejic, who heads the firm.

But when asked where in the world Serbians would prefer to live, a majority of those polled responded “mainly in the E.U. and the U.S.,” Pejic added

Serbia joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace program in 2006, but is not presently seeking membership in the military alliance.

“NATO has suffered great mistrust in public opinion due to the 1999 intervention, and this is not only limited to those who have lost family members,” Pejic said.

Serbia's neighbors include NATO members Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Croatia.

Professor Florian Bieber, director of the Center for Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, highlighted that Moscow is unhappy with former Warsaw Pact allies aligning themselves with the West.

“When Montenegro joined NATO this year, Russia was very hostile toward the Balkan nation and really tried to sabotage this process,” Bieber said. Russia denied allegations it was behind a failed bid to overthrow Montenegro's pro-Western government and assassinate the country's prime minister.

“There is strong interest of the West to assure that Serbia does not turn into a hostile country,"" he said, with Russia “playing the role of a spoiler in the region by trying to thwart Western influence, particularly that of NATO and the E.U.""

According to Bieber, Belgrade sees no reason to pick either side.

“This is a deliberate, strategic choice of the Serbian government, which is playing to both the West and Russia,” he said.

'Master of your own house'

On the streets of Belgrade, some say that neutrality is a shrewd approach.

Dragomir Ostojic Vladimir Banic / for NBC News

Dragomir Ostojic, 82, a retired forest engineer, said it was ""important to be a master of your own house"" and maintain independence from both Washington and Moscow.

""The U.S.A. and Russia are both strong, and we have to have political wisdom to stay away from their clashes,"" he said.

Radonja Milosavljević, 33, a waiter, supports a ""middle way"" that doesn't involve a military alliance with either the West or Russia.

""If we choose any side, there won't be anything better, just worse,"" he said. ""We should continue to balance.""

A matter of trust

Col. Ric Trimillos, known as Trimmy, the chief of international affairs for the U.S. Air Force in Europe, told NBC News that the ""Double Eagle"" drills and similar initiatives across the Balkans “are important to the overall posture and for regional stability.""

U.S. Army Spc. Uros Dzelebdzic Vladimir Banic / for NBC News

But the Pentagon's engagement with Serbia is also very much “about diplomacy,” according to Trimillos.

The U.S. military is “trying to avoid anything that looks like a threat,"" he said, and could potentially cause political “escalation” with countries including Russia.

However, the two U.S. military aircraft flying low-altitude sorties at 1,000 feet over Serbia last week represented an emotional homecoming for one American soldier.

U.S. Army Spc. Uros Dzelebdzic was born in Belgrade and lived in Serbia until he was 17. He went to America as an exchange student and joined the military around two years ago because he “wanted to give something back to the country that gave him so much.”

''This is a very special moment for me,” said Dzelebdzic, 30, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen through his military service. “It is important for this kind of joint exercise to happen, so that we can earn the trust of the Serbian population and military, and have them earn our trust.""

Jon Schuppe,"Thousands of inmates were released early in Louisiana, where a series of criminal-justice reforms could help it shed the label of America's top jailer.",2017-11-25T11:11:28Z,nbc-news,Louisiana is shedding its reputation as U.S.'s biggest jailer,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-shedding-its-reputation-u-s-s-biggest-jailer-n822981,https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_47/2236666/171122-louisiana-state-penitentiary-angola-se-1247p_cf0187e250d69f99e13ae90a2a3f86e9.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Freedom came five months early for Jerome White, and he reminds himself every morning not to spoil that gift.

White, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to vehicular homicide, was one of nearly 2,000 Louisiana prisoners whose sentences were cut short when lawmakers enacted a sweeping set of criminal justice reforms aimed at accelerating a drop in the number of people behind bars. All were set free at once on Nov 1., an unprecedented act of mercy in a tough-on-crime state that prompted warnings of unrehabilitated criminals preying on the public and sapping public resources.

“There are so many people who said, ‘They’re letting them out and they’re just going to go back,’ and I refuse to let that happen,” White said recently.

The release of inmates like White is one piece in an aggressive push to change the way Louisiana thinks about criminal justice, shrink its prison budget and earn a new reputation that once seemed implausible: as a leader in the nationwide effort to dismantle the machinery of mass incarceration.

A sweeping set of reforms is expected to cut Louisiana's prison population another 10 percent over the next decade, and save billions of dollars. NBC News

Sometime in the next few weeks or months, Louisiana's prison population will drop low enough to allow the state to shed the label of having America’s highest incarceration rate. Dropping to No. 2, or lower — Oklahoma, whose prison population is expected to keep growing, is in the second spot, and Mississippi is third — will become a bragging point for many officials, a sign that even the most punishment-reliant states can change their ways.

Other conservative states in the South, including Texas and South Carolina, have already shrunk prison populations while also cutting crime.

""The fact that Louisiana has the highest incarceration rate in the nation and a reputation for being tough as nails and has decided to take another direction sends a powerful message to its neighbors and states across the country,"" said Adam Gelb, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' public safety performance project, which helped Louisiana craft the reforms.

But the state's new direction has also exposed one of the most overlooked aspects of criminal justice reform: helping ex-offenders find the things they need to rebuild their lives ─ meaningful work, affordable housing, and proper health care.

The Nov. 1 releases inundated Louisiana’s small network of social-service organizations that assist returning prisoners, forcing them and state parole officials into triage mode. Advocates say the experience may force Louisiana to improve its re-entry efforts, which will be integral to the state’s goal to make reductions in the prison population — and the billions of dollars it is expected to save ─ permanent.

""It gave us a sense of urgency, with the sheer amount of people getting out at one time, but it was also an opportunity to fine tune how we do our work,"" said James Logan, re-entry services program manager for the city of New Orleans.

The reforms include a mandate to spend 70 percent of what the state saves on its prison budget — estimated at $262 billion over 10 years — on programs to reduce recidivism.

But the savings has to materialize first.

""It's not as though on Nov. 1 we also opened up a brand new affordable housing complex or someone came up with hundreds of new jobs,"" said Kelly Orians, staff attorney for The First 72+, a New Orleans organization that helps returning prisoners find jobs and places to live.

The package of 10 reform measures, signed by Gov. John Bel Edwards in June, lowered mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes, expanded alternatives to prison and made it easier for nonviolent offenders to earn ""good time release.""

While Louisiana's prison population has been gradually decreasing for several years, analysts predicted that the new laws would make that drop steady and long-lasting. The numbers will decline by 10 percent — from 35,682 to about 32,814 over the next decade, they said.

A big chunk of that reduction came immediately, thanks to provisions that allowed many of the changes to be applied retroactively, making hundreds of prisoners instantly eligible for freedom. State officials scrambled to determine who would be set free. In some parishes, including Orleans, where New Orleans is located, private re-entry groups partnered with parole officials to track those arriving home. But they didn't know exactly who'd be showing up — or what exactly they needed — until the last minute.

In the end, 1,952 inmates convicted of nonviolent crimes were sent home on Nov. 1, a massive one-time push that's in addition to the 1,500 or so that get released in a typical month, according to the state Department of Corrections. The early releases will continue for several months, but in much smaller batches.

About 80 percent of them arrived from local parish jails, where the state Department of Corrections houses thousands of inmates as part of a years-old arrangement that avoids the construction of new prisons. Those local lockups don't have nearly the same rehabilitative programs as state prisons, which made the re-entry effort even more challenging.

Most were only set free a few weeks or months early, but they became a target of critics, including many prosecutors, who warned they included habitual or violent criminals.

There has already been a highly publicized account of one newly released prisoner charged with armed robbery. Law enforcement officials have shared stories of others getting in trouble.

Statistically, it is unavoidable that some of them will commit new crimes. But the state hasn't done all it should to prevent it, said Dennis Schrantz, director of the Center for Justice Innovation, which works with parishes to assist returning prisoners.

""This is a call to arms for folks who supported this politically to say, 'Look, now that we support it, and the laws are changed, we need to step up and help these men and women because they're out early and they're not as prepared as they could have been,'"" Schrantz said.

East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore, whose parish became home for 145 newly freed prisoners on Nov. 1, said he objected to the early releases only because the men and women wouldn't be prepared to succeed. He's trying to come up with his own re-entry program. ""It's easy to say you want justice reform and get down to No. 2,"" he said. ""We're not proud or happy about the number of people we have in prison. But if you're going to have true justice reform, that means helping people so that they won't re-offend.""

Department of Corrections spokeswoman Natalie LaBorde said there was little more the state could have done. The agency says there are plans to improve re-entry plans in the local lockups. ""The reality is for us in Louisiana that we don't have hundreds of millions to reinvest. So that has to come from the savings,"" she said.

White considers himself lucky. Returning to New Orleans, where he once worked as a nurse, White, 32, was steered into part-time work at Catholic Charities. He is living in an apartment with his fiancee, has reconnected with his five young children, and is pursuing his dream of becoming a standup comic.

Every day, he said, he encourages himself to prove the critics wrong. And he keeps in mind the 48-year-old man he killed while driving drunk. ""What I'm doing now is for him, too,"" White said.

""I can't take back what happened,"" White added. ""I'll never know if his family forgives me, but the best thing I can do is be here in the moment, take care of my kids and do good.""","reoffend department of corrections

Still, a sharp rise in online sales brightened the overall outlook for those traditional retailers that have expanded beyond brick-and-mortar outlets, sending their shares higher in day-after-Thanksgiving trading. Stores also carefully managed inventory, seeking to ward off any post-holiday liquidation that would weigh on profits.

There was little evidence of the delirious shopper frenzy customary of previous Black Fridays, even as some stores got creative with gimmicks besides heavy discounts to draw in customers.

No data for Friday's brick-and-mortar business were immediately available.

Despite anecdotal signs of muted in-store sales — fewer cars in mall parking lots, shoppers leaving stores without purchases in hand — consumers are still expected to spend more overall this holiday season than last, analysts and industry executives said.

Black Friday online sales totaled at least $3.54 billion by 8 p.m. ET, up by 15.6 percent from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics, which measures transactions at the 100 largest U.S. web retailers. On Thanksgiving Day, U.S. shoppers spent more than $2.87 billion online.

Adobe projected that internet sales would reach a record $5 billion by the end of the night, with online retailers forecast to rake in $6.6 billion more on Cyber Monday.

Indeed, some chains struggled to keep up, with brief online outages experienced by Lowe's, H&M and the Gap, among others, according to website performance monitors.

Macy's customers in several states, including Texas, Arizona and Illinois, took to social media to complain about the retailer's credit card processing system. The company acknowledged that processing was taking longer than usual in its stores and said it was working on the problem.

Macy's and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. did better jobs of ordering and controlling inventory this time, said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resources Group, a consultancy with seven researchers out in the field.

""The turnout this morning has been relatively slow, but it is still the best we have seen in three years,"" Flickinger said, citing improving consumer confidence, a strong job market and healthy housing prices.

Fair weather across much of the nation also was factor, said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation.

Some shoppers were enticed by the promise of spectacle, while others felt the pull of nostalgia.

""There’s something nostalgic about being at the stores this early,” Jennifer Stasiak said at Chicago’s popular Oakbrook Center.

But not everyone found the Black Friday magic irresistible.

""I avoid the store, too many crowds,"" said Elana Silverstein, 32, a school counselor who was enjoying a warm, sunny day at a Los Angeles park. Instead, Silverstein said, she bought several personal items on sale Thursday night through the online marketplace Groupon.","dayafterthanksgiving

In a tweet late Friday as he spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Florida, Trump sounded dismissive of the honor he received last year and could well receive again.

Trump said the magazine informed him he was “probably” going to be granted the title for the second year in a row. He tweeted: “I said probably is no good and took a pass.”

Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017

Time later posted a tweet of its own disputing Trump's account.

The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6. — TIME (@TIME) November 25, 2017

Alan Murray, chief content officer at Time Inc., said there was ""not a speck of truth"" to the president's claims.

Related: Time asks Donald Trump’s golf clubs to remove phony magazine cover

Rick Stengel, a former Time managing editor who left the publication to join the Obama administration State Department, said he thinks Trump fired off the tweet to preempt the fact that he wasn't selected.

""I suspected that perhaps he knew he wasn't going to get it and he wanted to look like he was turning it down before he was turned down,"" Stengel told NBC News.

Stengel said the magazine typically interviews multiple candidates for the Person of the Year issue, and that it's likely that the president could be a finalist, but he doubts that editors would consider Trump for the recognition two years in a row.

Trump frequently brags about appearing on the cover of the iconic magazine. He has falsely claimed to hold the record for cover appearances, and was revealed earlier this year to have displayed fake issues of Time with himself on the cover at several of his private golf clubs.

Roy McClellan of Las Vegas was killed Nov. 17 while hitchhiking on State Route 160 in Pahrump, about 50 miles west of Las Vegas.

His widow, Denise McClellan, told NBC affiliate KSNV she can't understand why her 52-year-old husband survived the shooting, only to die in a hit-and-run. She says the mass shooting ""was messing with his head"" and that he was undergoing therapy.

The Nevada Highway Patrol says it is seeking the driver of a Chevrolet Camaro with front-end damage.

On Oct. 30, a married couple from California died in a car crash after having survived the massacre a few weeks earlier.

While driving, Dennis and Lorraine Carver collided into a metal gate and their car burst into flames near their home.

In a public Facebook post, their eldest daughter Brooke explained how heartbroken she and her younger sister are because of the death of their parents.

""It's hard to see Gods plan right now and how this was all part of it, but through the support of family and friends we have been pushing through,"" she wrote. ""Thank you to everyone who brought happiness to my parents lives, they were the most grateful, generous, and strong people, and we know they are looking down on us guiding us from above.""

Putin signed the bill into law Saturday after the upper chamber of the Russian parliament adopted it Wednesday. The move is seen as a quid pro quo after U.S. officials demanded that state-media outlet Russia Today, or RT, register as a foreign agent with the U.S. Justice Department.

In 1938, Congress passed the Foreign Agent Registration Act in an effort to curb the amount of German propaganda circulating in the United States.

Since then, the law has primarily been used to help Americans recognize propaganda, and the people and organizations that are ""attempting to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and laws,"" according to the Department of Justice.

Earlier this month, the Russian Embassy in the U.S. warned that the decision to force RT to register as an agent would ""inevitably trigger an immediate and symmetrical response.""

In a statement posted to the embassy's Facebook page, officials accused the U.S. of deliberately hurting the U.S.-Russia relations.

""We consider its demand as a wish to eliminate an alternative source of information, which is an unacceptable violation of the international norms of free press,"" the statement said.

Even before Putin signed the bill into law, Russia's Justice Ministry warned U.S. government-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, along with its regional outlets, that they could be designated as foreign agents under the new law.

The DOJ's decision to force the network to register as a Russian agent comes amid increased scrutiny and new revelations about Russia's campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.

Earlier this month, representatives from Twitter, Google and Facebook testified before Congress about the role their companies played in sharing Russian-linked propaganda during the U.S. presidential campaign.

An estimated 126 million Americans — or roughly a third of the nation's population — were exposed to Russian-linked content on Facebook during last year's election, according to Facebook officials.

Twitter has since banned RT, and Russian media outlet Sputnik from advertising on its platform. And on Wednesday, Facebook announced they will be creating a new tool to let users check to see if they were exposed to information shared by fake Russian accounts during the election.

""It is important that people understand how foreign actors tried to sow division and mistrust using Facebook before and after the 2016 US election,"" Facebook said in a blog post.

Panels at both Arizona State University and the University of Kansas met this week and coincidentally came to the same decision on the same day.

Arizona's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication gave Rose an award for journalism excellence in 2015. But the actions reported about Rose were too ""egregious"" to ignore, according to Dean Christopher Callahan.

""The actions victimized young women much like those who make up the overwhelming majority of Cronkite students — young women who deserve to enter workplaces that reward them for their hard work, intelligence and creativity and where they do not have to fear for their safety or dignity,"" Callahan said in a statement.

Callahan said the action was mostly symbolic. But he hoped it would send a message that sexual misconduct would not be tolerated. The award has never been revoked since it was created in 1984. Past recipients include Bob Woodward, Diane Sawyer and Christiane Amanpour.

The William Allen White Foundation, which supports journalism education at the University of Kansas, presented Rose an award last spring. The National Citation award has been bestowed on a journalist annually since 1950. Other recipients include Bob Woodward and Gwen Ifill.

After the allegations against Rose surfaced, the foundation's board of trustees voted to revoke the honor. In a news release, officials said Rose ""does not exemplify the ideals of this award.""

Eight women who worked for or wanted to work for Rose told the Washington Post Monday that the veteran newsman groped them, openly walked around nude or said sexually inappropriate things on the job.

The fallout for Rose was swift. After initially suspending him, CBS News fired Rose from its morning show Tuesday. Three women at the network have since come forward with complaints with two saying he grabbed them inappropriately.

PBS, which broadcasts his eponymous interview program, cut ties with Rose.

In a statement earlier this week, Rose apologized for his actions and said he was ""greatly embarrassed.""

“In my 45 years in journalism, I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked,” Rose said in a statement. “Nevertheless, in the past few days, claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues.”

""It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,” the statement continued. “I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.""","dean christopher callahan

A preliminary investigation into the Friday night shooting indicated that three to four suspects approached the store on foot and opened fire after 7 p.m. ET, said Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams.

At one point, the 40-year-old store owner and his 12-year-old son ran outside to investigate the noise, and the boy was struck in the torso before the suspects fled on foot, police said.

The pair retreated back inside and discovered he had been shot. He died at the scene, reported NBC affiliate WKYC. The station identified the victims as Abdel Latif Bashiti.

The other children hit by the gunfire were ages 14 to 16. Williams said the suspects are believed to be juveniles as well.

""We don't know exactly what spurred this or what happened, but you know, definitely our hearts go out to the family of the victims here,"" Williams said. ""All we have are juveniles on foot. They fired shots and they took off running.""

One of the victims was shot in the head and was being treated at University Hospital, police said. The others suffered gunshot wounds to the groin, leg or torso.

No arrests have been made in connection with the shooting, and Williams said there was no immediate indication the shooting was gang related. WKYC said the suspects were wearing either black- or dark-colored hoodies.

Local activists planned to hold a vigil and a rally for peace Saturday night in the intersection where the shooting occurred.

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson encouraged anyone with information about to call Crime Stoppers.

""We know that as things happen out on the street there's a lot of conversation,"" he said. ""We'd like to have as much information as we can get in order to find who did this.""

More than 135 people were killed in Ohio's second-largest city in 2016, making it Cleveland's deadliest year in a decade, WKYC reported. The city has topped 100 homicides so far in 2017.","university hospital

Investigative reporter Jake Bernstein reported his discovery on his website on Friday, revealing that some secrets of the world’s rich and powerful remain hidden among the massive trove of leaked documents.

The latest revelations involve a Panamanian company called Process Consultans (sic), which was created as “an anonymous shell company” in 1985 by people not named in the Panama Papers.

This company purchased a condo in the newly constructed Trump Palace in 1991, before selling it three years later in a deal brokered exclusively by Trump Corporation.

Bernstein goes on to explain that the sale of the Trump apartment was not the last time Process Consultans appears in the Panama Papers.

“In 2006, [Panamanian law firm] Mossack Fonseca contacted the Ecuadorian industrialist [suspected by Bernstein of being behind Process Consultans] about his cimpany,” Bernstein writes.

“It appears the firm lost touch with the owner and believed he wanted the company dissolved. Mossack Fonseca went to UBS, which rejected any responsibility for the matter.”

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Bernstein concludes: “By 2008, Mossack Fonseca had created more than 160,000 offshore entities. This torrent of secret companies, particularly the older ones, had become difficult to manage.

“Still, as long as everyone got paid — including Donald Trump —nobody asked too many questions.”

Read more: Who was behind the investigation into elite’s tax havens?

The Panama Papers was first published in full in May, 2016, by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The cache of 11.5 million files spanning 40 years reveals over 360,000 names linked to Mossack Fonseca.

The scandal drew in several world leaders, including former UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Iceland Prime Minister Sigmunder Gunnlaugsson—who resigned on April 5, 2016, after it was revealed he had not disclosed his financial interests when he took office.

“It’s the biggest leak we’ve ever seen of this kind,” John Christensen, director and co-founder of the UK-based Tax Justice Network, said at the time of the papers release. “While many people don’t know it, this affects the global economy, the way our governments work, all of us every single working day of our lives.”

Bernstein’s most recent finding marks the first instance chronologically of Trump’s name appearing in the Panama Papers but it is not the only time the President’s name appears in the documents.

Within the ICIJ database, Trump’s name appears 3,450 times, though many of these can be attributed to other companies and investors that have used his name.","reutersjonathan ernst bernstein

Summer Meza,A new witness has emerged to tell his story surrounding Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan's mysterious disappearance.,2017-11-25T15:55:34Z,newsweek,"Amelia Earhart spent days in prison before being killed in Saipan, according to new story",http://www.newsweek.com/amelia-earhart-disappear-theory-saipan-722338,http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/25/amelia.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"A man’s newly-shared story provides new information backing the theory that Amelia Earhart was taken prisoner and executed on Saipan after disappearing from her flight around the world 80 years ago.

The idea that Earhart and her companion Fred Noonan were captured by the Japanese when they vanished in 1937 is one of several theories - over half a century later, no one is exactly sure of their fate. But a family tale from William Sablan, a man who lives on the Mariana Islands, says that Earhart was brought to Saipan and spent several days in prison after being brought to the South Pacific island by ship.

The story fits with the theory brought to light by the History Channel’s documentary titled Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence. In the TV special, historians purport that the U.S. government knew that Earhart was captured and killed by the Japanese, and that the government even found and exhumed her body before lying about her fate for decades.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

Sablan’s story comes from his uncle, Tun Akin Tuho, as reported by USA Today on Saturday. Tuho worked at the prison where Earhart and Noonan were apparently taken prisoner, and told Sablan that their arrival caused quite a commotion. Saipan was a hub for the Japanese, but it was rare to see white people on the island.

“They had no reason to be there,” Sablan said.

He said that Earhart’s plane dropped into the ocean before she and Noonan were captured and arrested. Sablan’s story is one of dozens of alleged witnesses, who have told of their possible run-ins with Earhart in several different places, under multiple circumstances.

Representatives from the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told the New York Times that Earhart possibly landed on the island of Nikumaroro, transmitting distress signals in hopes of a rescue, but ultimately ending up stranded.

A famous photo fits with the theory that Earhart was captured in the South Pacific, showing the profile of a white woman with cropped hair sitting on a dock in the Marshall Islands. Some believe that her plane can be seen in the background of the photo, but not all agree that it’s strong evidence. A Japanese blogger said that Earhart couldn’t possibly be the one in the photo, since he says it was published two years before her disappearance.

The mystery continues as historians and researchers continue to unveil evidence surrounding whether or not Earhart and Noonan were still alive in July 1937.","south pacific island

Today, many of Fidel's followers describe his demise as a “transition to immortality.”

A year after Fidel’s death, some wonder whether Castro is willing to leave power on February 24, 2018—as he promised in 2013—especially in the face of President Donald Trump's crackdown on U.S. business and travel to the island. The sanctions, which took effect earlier this month, prohibit Americans from doing business with 180 entities linked to the Cuban military, intelligence and security services.

Given the current state of U.S.-Cuba relations, this may be an incentive for Castro to extend his term. “The fatherland is in danger; it is facing very difficult economic circumstances plus the threat of aggression from a historical enemy. Facing difficult circumstances, revolutionary leaders don’t back down,” Domingo Amuchastegui, a former Cuban intelligence analyst who lives in Miami, told The Miami Herald.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

Most recently, Cuba and the United States have been in the crosshairs with respect to the alleged sonic attack against U.S. embassy staff in Havana, which led to the removal of 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington in early October. Earlier this month, the U.S.—alongside Israel—voted against a U.N. resolution that underlined the need to lift the embargo against the island. The measure was overwhelmingly approved in the U.N General Assembly by a 191-2 vote.

Marcelino Vazquez/ACN/Reuters

Trump’s draconian stance on Cuba and North Korea brought both countries together. Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodriguez and his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho held an “anti-U.S.” meeting in Havana this week and called on the U.S. to “respect both nations’ sovereignty, independence, self-determination and territorial integrity.”

In addition to the deteriorated relationship with the United States, Cuba has recently faced other economic challenges caused by Hurricane Irma in September and a waning aid from Venezuela.

But despite Cuba’s woes, others believe that the Caribbean nation without the Castros in power is possible. Castro’s daughter, Mariela, said earlier this year that she “would never want to be a contender for the presidency,” Reuters reported.

For this reason, Castro would grant power to Miguel Díaz-Canel, first vice president of the Council of the State. Diaz-Canel, 56, represents a break from the “revolutionary old guard,” The Miami Herald said, since he wasn’t even born when the Cuban Revolution rallied against the right-wing government of Fulgencio Batista in 1959.

Another reason for Castro to step down is his advanced age and the health complications that could come with it, something that occurred to his brother when his health condition began to worsen in 2006. Raul, 86, said during the 2016 party congress that age 60 is the limit to enter the party’s core committee while 70 is the maximum age to hold government and party positions. ""Somebody who is 65 or 70 is useful for important activities, but not the activities of an important leader,"" Business Insider cited him.

Even though Castro would not be a visible leader starting next February, his clout may still endure. Castro has worked to strengthen institutions “to guarantee the regime’s continuity,” American University professor William LeoGrande told the Herald. “Besides, Castro has said nothing about stepping down as first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba,” LeoGrande said, adding that Castro is likely to continue to wield influence in policy decisionmaking.

365 days without Fidel

Keystone/Getty

Cuba’s squares and public areas do not bear Fidel Castro’s name—at least that was his wish before passing. Cubans, however, held a vigil at the University of Havana Friday to celebrate the life of the comandante and made signs that read ""Forever Fidel,"" or ""I am Fidel"" on the streets, according to Colombian newspaper El Tiempo.

The island will hold remembrances between today and December 4, the day Castro was interred in a cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, the city where the revolution started, Voice of America reported. State television has been running archived videos of Castro, and cultural centers are paying tribute to his memory with performances.

The events come at a time when Cubans will be participating in municipal elections, whose votes will end with the selection of a new president in February 2018, Voice of America added.

Castro was always a polarizing figure, and some Twitter users expressed their admiration and contempt for the late leader. This user said that “refusing to mourn Fidel Castro’s death is punishable by prison.”

Others remembered “60 years of tyranny and oppression.”

This user said in Spanish, “Cuba is a prison without democracy ever since Communism arrived on the island.”

Other users said that “the love the people of Cuba have for Fidel lifts my heart so much.”

This user tweeted, “Forever Fidel, I am Fidel”

This Twiter user added in Spanish that “Cuba is a country with excellent healthcare professionals, great public education and high-quality culture.”

For almost 50 years, Castro developed a defiant relationship with the United States. His antagonistic stance led to the failed U.S. invasion of Bay of Pigs in 1961, and he almost pushed the world to the brink of a nuclear war during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Castro became a “towering international figure” in the 20th century, according to The New York Times.","marcelino vazquezacnreuters

On Friday, Trump tweeted that the magazine had contacted him to say he was “probably” going to be named its Person of the Year.

Trump has previously falsely boasted that he holds the record for the most Time magazine cover appearances­—and even had a fake Time cover issue hung in his office in his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and several other golf courses.

The Person of the Year title is not an honorific, but instead recognizes the person who ""for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year.”

Trump was named Person of the Year in 2016, after defying expectations to win the U.S. presidency. Trump reacted by describing the title as a ""great honor.""

In a tweet the magazine said the president was “incorrect” in his claims about how the magazine chooses its Person of the Year, and would not comment on its choice until publication of the issue, on Dec. 6.

Former Time editor Richard Stengel wrote in a tweet that the use of the word “probably” meant Trump had missed out on the title, and taunted Trump for the fake cover.

""Hate to tell you but that probably means you're not Person of the Year. They just wanted a photo shoot. But I'm sure you still have that fake Time cover somewhere in storage.""","richard stengel

Maria Perez,Cuban President Raul Castro met with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho in an effort to defuse tensions over a nuclear war.,2017-11-25T16:00:18Z,newsweek,Cuba hopes to help to defuse tensions between North Korea and the U.S.,http://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-meets-cuban-president-after-threatening-blow-us-states-722343,http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/25/rts1iy5n.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Cuban President Raul Castro met with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong on Friday to ease tensions and avoid war with the U.S, Reuters reported.

North Korea is currently under a lot of pressure from the U.S. and the international community to stop its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Since 1960, Cuba has remained close ties with North Korea but has opposed nuclear weapons.

“In the brotherly encounter, both sides commented on the historic friendship between the two nations and talked about international topics of mutual interest,” Cuban state television said during its midday broadcast.

North Korea is currently working on developing nuclear-tipped missiles that are capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Ri is aiming to achieve what he has called “a real balance of power with the United States”.

This has not been the first time Castro has met with other foreign leaders to try to defuse tensions of war with North Korea. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday he had previously discussed with Castro the possibility of working together to defuse global tensions between North Korea sometime last year.

During his visit to Cuba, which kicked off earlier this week, Ri also met Cuba's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bruno Rodriguez. The two denounced U.S. “unilateral and arbitrary lists and designations” that led to “coercive measures contrary to international law”, according to Cuba’s foreign ministry. The ministers also called for “respect for peoples’ sovereignty” and the “peaceful settlement of disputes,"" according to a ministry statement.

President Donald Trump has put a lot of stress on Cuba since he has been in office, as his administration has halted on a détente started under the Barack Obama administration and returned to hardline rhetoric.

The situation became even more complicated and increased the number of North Korean missile launches and nuclear tests. This led to a new round of international sanctions against Pyongyang.

Raul took over the presidency in 2008 from his older brother and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, who died last year.

North Korea and Cuba are the last countries in the world to maintain Soviet-style command economies. Under Raul Castro, the Caribbean nation has taken small steps toward the more market-oriented communism of China and Vietnam.","sovietstyle command

Analysts from GBH Insights suggest Amazon’s Black Friday sales comprised up to 50 percent of all e-commerce sales on November 24, while forecasts suggest Cyber Monday will see record-breaking sales for the online retail giant.

No sales figures have been released by Amazon but it said two of the most popular items were two products made by Amazon: The Echo Dot and the Fire TV Stick.

Amazon’s Cyber Monday sale will start a day early at 5pm (EDT) on Sunday for owners of an Alexa-powered device, allowing voice shoppers to get a head start on the best deals.

Shoppers will see the following deals at Amazon on Cyber Monday : Amazon Echo Dot for $29.99 (was $49.99); Amazon Kindle for $49.99 (was $79.99); Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote for $24.99 (was $39.99); Sony 55-inch 4K UHD smart TV for $598; Up to 30 percent savings on selected Lego sets; Up to 60 percent savings on hit video games, including Call of Duty: WWII and Overwatch.

Forecasts suggest that consumers will spend an estimated $3.81 billion on Cyber Monday in 2017, up from an all-time high in the U.S. last year for retailers of $3.45bn of sales in a single day.

“This is being driven by changes to the retail industry underpinned by innovation and the digital economy. The smartphone, digital marketing and finding ways to fulfill the online customer experience are all trends that continue to transform the retail industry,” Jeremy Gleeson, a fund manager at AXA Investment Managers, said in an emailed comment to Newsweek.

“Traditional bricks and mortar businesses are increasingly requiring expertise from third party specialists in order to compete and catch up with ‘digital native’ businesses [like Amazon].”

Other analysts say the trend towards online shopping that was displayed on Black Friday is likely continue after Cyber Monday right through the holidays.

“The strong online performance of Black Friday this season shows that consumers are moving further away from leaving their homes to do holiday shopping,” says Taylor Schreiner, director at Adobe Digital Insights.

“Mobile in particular has ramped up in a significant way, driving $1.4 billion in online revenue on Black Friday alone. The fact that nearly a billion dollars of this came through smartphones shows that hesitancy around shopping on smaller screens has begun to dissipate.”","reutersphilippe wojazer

In the hours before dawn the Shiite faithful return to the roads of southern Iraq, bound for the holy city of Karbala. The frail and the elderly, the young men carrying colored flags of devotion and entire generations of families appear out of the low-hanging mist that shrouds the banks of the Euphrates.

As they come in their millions, the flow of pilgrims meanders across Iraq’s highways—principally from Najaf 40 miles to the south or from Baghdad 50 miles to the north. Some walk further to show their dedication by making the journey onfoot for as many as 300 miles from neighboring Kuwait. All of them share the goal of reaching the shrine of Shiite Islam’s third Imam, Hussein, for the commemoration of Arbaeen, in remembrance of his death at the battle of Karbala in A.D. 680.

The battle between Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, and the forces of the Umayyad Caliph Yazid solidified the rift between Sunni and Shiite Islam that has plagued the Middle East in the centuries since and which, to this day, engulfs the region in sectarian violence.

For Islam’s minority Shiites, Hussein’s defeat and martyrdom is a history of sacrifice in the face of unassailable odds. In Iraq his death is seen reflected in the losses of the more recent political past: Shiite fighters lost in the fight against the Sunni Islamic State militant group, ISIS, or the years of repression under the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

While the majority of Karbala’s Arbaeen pilgrims are drawn from Iraq, Iran, the republics of central Asia and from the Asian subcontinent, the commemoration draws visitors from across the world. Estimates for the annual number of attendees ranges from six to 20 million individuals, according to different sources.

For Mujahid Abdul-Karim, the Imam of the Masjid al-Rasul Mosque in Watts, Los Angeles, the pilgrimage represents what he describes as “the fulfillment of my spiritual journey.” The 72-year-old African American, who travelled some 8,000 miles to reach Karbala from Los Angeles and walked a portion of the last leg of his journey from Najaf, tells Newsweek the experience of coming to Iraq as an Shiite Muslim convert is “overwhelming.”

Abdul-Karim, who played a central role in ending some of the worst gang violence in Watts between the Bloods and the Cripps in the early 1990s, explains the story of Karbala holds a specific relevancy to the experience of African Americans. “We, as African Americans more than any other people can identify with that because we were brought to America in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

“We were brought to America in slave ships and we were tortured and persecuted for 400 years. Even to this day black people in America are persecuted and deprived of their human rights,” he says.

For other American pilgrims Arbaeen offers an opportunity to reconnect spiritually and do charitable works in a country recovering from over a decade of war. Sakina Rizvi, a program officer for an international medical organization based in New York, explains that providing medical care during Arbaeen is part of the commemoration.

Her organization, Imamia Medics International, has been providing medical assistance in Iraq in recent decades, and runs a special program for doctors from around the world to provide care to pilgrims during Arbaeen. Visitors receive treatment for run-of-the-mill problems like coughs and colds, strains and other ailments associated with the walk to Karbala. Other pilgrims are treated for longer-term problems, thanks to the dental, X-ray and other services provided.

Specialist doctors taking part, can often be called upon to give more mundane treatments, depending on the need. But all do so out of a sense of service. “Part of that medical mission is to help people. You have someone who is a radiologist who will be tending to someone's blisters and he is happy,” Rizvi says.

Noor Zaidi, an assistant professor from Maryland who volunteered overnight at one of the medical clinics and saw patients with issues varying from colds to an the onset of a cardiac arrest, said that for some, giving medical assistance could be the most fulfilling part of the pilgrimage.

“I think it is always a more meaningful experience than they expect it to be” she says. “It is actually really difficult to get into the shrine and to do the pilgrimage,” she added, “but you can still serve the people.”

[[nid:721436]] Abdullah Dhiaa al-Deen

During Arbaeen the streets of Karbala throng with pilgrims all clad in black. Processions setting off towards the shrine dedicated to Hussein are set-pieces of pageantry and mourning. In some, participants don the the seventh-century clothing worn by warriors in the battle between Hussein and Yazid. In others, the faithful flagellate themselves with metal chains to the sounds of devotional music. Many of the processions are organized by international groups—the green Lebanese cedar or the white crescent of Pakistan wave furiously as the devoted pass along the main thoroughfare towards the golden domes of the Imam Hussein Mosque.

Along the roads of the city sit mawquibs. These tented stalls provide a place to sleep and the free food that fuels the pilgrimage. Visitors to the city will queue for shawarma, rice and fava beans or a glass of sugary Iraqi tea at the myriad tents. Those who don’t have a house to stay in or a hotel for the night can sleep in one, even if on a mild November night, many stay up praying till dawn, and others simply opt to sleep outside. beneath the stars and the crescents atop the minarets of Karbala’s mosques.

Just after lunch, one mawquib near the Imam Hussein Shrine is starting its preparations for dinner. Butchered chickens are laid out on trays to be marinaded. Zaid Farad, who brought the outdoor kitchen from Baghdad and his team of half a dozen volunteer chefs prepare up to 2,000 meals a day over the course of the ten days of Arbaeen.

By 2:00 p.m. the tent which also serves as sleeping quarters, hosts 15 sleeping pilgrims just arrived in Karbala. In one corner lies a group of Iranians. Others have come from Iraq’s deep south. For Farad, who has been coming to Arbaeen since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the memories of the religious festival are bittersweet. His tent is bedecked with pictures of friends and travel companions lost to the fight against the Islamic State. “Everyone has a duty,” Farad says. “They have been fighting and we feel honored to be here to serve the pilgrims.”

For the Shiite and the outside world, the growing attendance at the Arbaeen has been seen as an analogue for a resurgent Iraq. The country has driven the scourge of ISIS from its towns and cities and for the first time in living memory, the Shiite political class are secure in their preeminence.

Saad al-Deen Hashim, the general manager of the Imam Hussein Mosque, knows as well as most the struggles Iraq’s Shiite religious centers have faced in the recent past. Hashim was one of the hundreds of Shiites jailed by the Baath regime through the 1980’s Saddam Hussein, a Sunni leader, sought to crush his Shiite opposition through systematic repression. The Arbaeen pilgrimage was banned. Those who trod the road to Karbala hid by the river or trekked across country, under threat of imprisonment.

Hashim says he is proud of the work that has been done in Karbala since the 2003 U.S. invasion ended Saddam’s repression. ”We are happy because of all the doors of the shrines are open 24 hours each day. We faced many obstacles at the beginning,” he says. “Many people were against us and we faced many problems but we proved that we could stand on our own and continue to serve.”

Trump in 2017 could easily answer the questions he had just last year: as president, he's left the White House more so than any other in modern American history during their first year in office, racking up an exorbitant bill for taxpayers as he continues a golfing binge at Trump-branded properties across the country.

The president spent Saturday morning golfing at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, his fourth consecutive day visiting the club this week and his 102nd day visiting one of his own properties since assuming the Oval Office.

Andy Buchanan, Getty

Despite having visited the club each day since Wednesday, the president only began admitting he was golfing at the exclusive course on Friday, when he tweeted that he would “quickly” play with professional golfers Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson before taking care of his presidential duties from his private Mar-a-Lago resort.

""After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, to play golf (quickly),"" Trump wrote Friday, before departing in the presidential motorcade minutes later for his golfing excursion. ""Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!""

Images of the president and his golfing partners quickly reached social media, with videos showing Trump and his extensive security detail walking throughout the course.

The golfing trip may have been more than a relaxing getaway for Trump, whose private business organization is working on a foreign contract to build the Trump World Golf Club Dubai, with a course designed by Woods himself. Trump claimed he was heading back to his resort to work on creating new American jobs immediately after golfing, though it remains unclear whether he and Woods discussed his company's international project, which will include thousands of villas, as well as an elite community complete with restaurants, nurseries, shops, schools and a lake.

""This unparalleled development provides luxury living on a grand scale, with over 2,000 hotel apartments of varying size, all offering exceptional views of the development, the lake and the lush fairways of the Trump World Golf Club Dubai,"" a brochure of the site reads. ""The properties are fully furnished and our staff is available to you 24 hours a day, to ensure that you enjoy premium service on a par with the world’s finest hotels.""

Thought it appears Trump has continued a more than healthy schedule of golfing and visiting his own properties as president, perhaps that’s not the only promise he broke to the American people: as president, he said his company would not work with foreign entities.","trump international golf

Will Leitch,"Just a few years ago, it was an unassailable empire. Now, suddenly, it’s the fall of Rome.",2017-11-25T12:00:00.695Z,new-york-magazine,Is This the End of the NFL?,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/leitch-is-this-the-end-of-the-nfl.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/22/magazine/22-leitch.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Photo: Scott Boehm/AP Photo

A few weekends ago, at a seersucker-in-November southern horse-racing event I attended with some lovely and friendly people who will nevertheless be the first ones taken out when the revolution comes, a family friend, an older white man, asked me what I, the one sportswriter he knew, thought of the kneeling NFL players. I told him that while I stand for the anthem myself, I supported the players’ right to express themselves politically and encouraged him to worry less about the kneeling and more about what the players were trying to say. He snorted and said he was done with the NFL until “they stand their ass up.” We then drank some bourbon and found something else to talk about.

Later on, I spoke with another family friend, one with long hair and a big bushy beard and an anarchic spirit (he whispered “Fuck all these Trump people” to me with a winking smile). I had just returned from the World Series and told him in February I’d be heading to the Super Bowl. “I don’t know how you can watch that,” he said. “Just jingoistic military bullshit.” He asked me if I would let my sons play, or if I worried it would “smash their brains.” We then drank some more bourbon and found something else to talk about.

There was a time, not long ago, when the NFL was the most unifying public institution we had. No matter your political or demographic persuasion, the one thing you could find to talk about with someone was football. Richard Nixon and Hunter S. Thompson bonded over football, for crying out loud. Over the decades, the Super Bowl grew into the ultimate American spectacle, the last event that everyone in the country watched together, whether you cared about the game, the commercials, the point spread, or just Left Shark. You couldn’t avoid the NFL if you wanted to. Most didn’t.

Now, suddenly, the league that was once for everyone seems to be in crisis. Worse, it has no natural constituency. Liberals think it’s dangerous, classist, totalitarian, and cruel. Conservatives think it’s pandering, too “politically correct.” A lot of this is attributable, like so much else, to the president. Dozens of players were protesting the first two weeks of the season, but no one seemed to care … until Trump’s weekend tweetstorm from his golf club back in September. But the fact that we’re even framing this in political terms — the idea that a game in which people throw a ball and tackle each other has somehow become another thing for us all to yell at each other about from our ideological corners — is a large part of the problem. You can no longer watch the NFL without thinking of everything swirling around it off the field. The bigger problem for the league is: So many people just aren’t watching at all.

Television ratings have been down for the past several years, with this year’s down 5.7 percent. Why? Part of it is just the shrinking of all TV audiences — broadcasters once thought that live sports were one thing people would continue to tune in for in an age of streaming and cord cutting, but that doesn’t mean sports are immune.

The larger problem is that the NFL, like many empires before it, got too large, too cocky, and too ambitious, and it overreached. One of the main reasons NFL ratings have always been so high is a simple one: NFL teams play only 16 regular-season games a year, traditionally on one designated day a week. This has turned games into must-see events, appointment programming: It makes each game feel special. And for a 16-game season to compete with an 82-game season or a 162-game season, it has to feel special: For the NFL to outearn its rival sports, each game has to bring in many times more TV revenue. Which is one reason why, with television networks so desperate for a ratings goose, the NFL added a Thursday-night game (much against players’ wishes), hoping it would become another must-see marquee event (and allowing beleaguered networks CBS and NBC to fill a night on their schedule). This is increasingly turning out to be a disastrous decision. The games do not have cachet. And because Thursday-night teams are always playing on short rest, their play is choppy and disorganized, the players exhausted. This makes the games ugly to watch, a terrible advertisement for the product. And, perhaps worst of all, it oversaturates the market. The more days you add to the schedule, the less special the games seem. Which means fewer people watch them.

Quality of play is not just a connoisseur’s complaint. The NFL has always been slow to react to issues of player safety, but in recent years, it has instituted a series of cosmetic changes meant to address growing discontent. These changes have arguably failed on both fronts: They’ve made the game less fun to watch, and they’re probably not keeping anyone safer. There is now a “concussion protocol,” in which a player thought to have a concussion is kept out of the game until he can pass a series of tests, which sounds positive until you remember that most doctors say the real danger of CTE for players comes not from the traumatic events but “subconcussive” hits — damage that becomes much worse over time than what the “big hits” cause. This is also the case with “targeting,” a penalty that has evolved over the years and now punishes helmet-to-helmet hits and leads to ejections. But, again, the real danger still comes from the fundamental pounding that football players sustain over years of play. So these targeting penalties probably don’t make any difference, and they’ve taken out some of the violence that many fans respond viscerally to. The NFL, once again, can’t win for losing. People are mad at it for the toll the game takes on the players’ brains, but people are also mad at it because the ways it has tried to address the issue have made the games less kinetic and compelling.

Compounding the problem — and the frustrations of NFL owners — has been the ascendancy of the NBA. Whereas the NFL felt like the sport that best fit the cultural spirit of the past decades of American life, it’s the NBA that reflects the future. All at once, the NBA has one of its greatest-ever teams (the Golden State Warriors), led by an inner-sanctum future Hall of Famer (Kevin Durant) and the league’s most beloved player (Stephen Curry); it has perhaps the best player since Michael Jordan (LeBron James), who also happens to be one of the most vital, globalist brand-called-me icons of our time; and it has a freewheeling, deeply pleasant style of play that is both an evolution of decades of on-court style and irresistible to watch. Perhaps more important, it has actively embraced the personalities, and the power, of its players, from the goofy man-child Twitter giddiness of 76ers star Joel Embiid to the Euro-charm of the Knicks’ own Kristaps Porzingis to an unprecedented spate of political activism culminating in the still-surreal spectacle of LeBron calling President Trump “U bum” on Twitter (which actually shut Trump up; he hasn’t talked about the NBA since). The NBA is vibrant and organic and alive; the NFL feels both toxic and bathed in amber. The league won’t even let the players take their helmets off to celebrate; how much could we possibly be expected to care about these people?

A few weeks ago, sportscaster Bob Costas told a group of students at the University of Maryland that “the reality is that this game destroys people’s brains” and that “the whole thing could collapse like a house of cards if people actually begin connecting the dots.” Costas is a smart man, and more than that, he is a survivor: One of the skills of his career has been understanding which way the winds are blowing and adjusting accordingly. For the past several years, he was the host of the pregame show for the most-watched NFL game every week, Football Night in America. He left the show this year and has been speaking out against the NFL ever since. For the past few years, it was reasonable to wonder whether defending the NFL was going to put you on the wrong side of history. It is becoming increasingly clear that that history is nigh.

Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa earlier this month, clearing a path for his wife, Grace, to succeed him with Trumpesque subtlety. That proved a bridge too far for both the military and his ZANU-PF party, the underwriters of the 93-year-old dictator’s nearly four decades in power. Mugabe resigned on Tuesday after both pillars of his authority turned on him, while Mnangagwa, who fled the country to escape an alleged plot against his life, is expected to take over the presidency within 48 hours.

For a 37-year dictatorship to end without bloodshed is no small miracle. Africa’s other most famous post-colonial dictators — like Uganda’s Idi Amin, Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi, and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) — required wars to dislodge them, and none of these cases led to freedom and democracy. Uganda has come a long way since Amin was deposed in 1979, but it has now had the same president (Yoweri Museveni) for 31 years. Freedom House’s 2017 report on the state of freedom in the world actually labels Uganda as “not free,” whereas Zimbabwe is considered “partly free.”

As for Libya and DR Congo, the collapse of their longterm dictatorships led to devastating wars that turned these countries into failed states for years to come. With past as precedent, to see Zimbabwe remove Mugabe nonviolently is a heartening development. It gives the country a much better chance at coming out of this transition a freer country than it was a week ago. It has certainly raised hopes of more honest elections being held there in the future.

But there’s also a good chance those hopes will be dashed.

Just as many in the western media have been taken in by Saudi Arabia’s palace coup masquerading as a genuine “drain the swamp” anti-corruption project, those cheering on the Zimbabwean military for putting Mugabe under house arrest and convincing him to finally cede his office may be putting too much faith in the people who made this happen. Both the ZANU-PF and the military want Mnangagwa, not Grace Mugabe, to be their next leader; they are less concerned about whether he uses that position to democratize Zimbabwe or not. In fact, they might not appreciate it if he does.

Zimbabwe, after all, has never exactly been a free country. The white colonial leaders of what was then Southern Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence in 1965 (citing the precedent of 1776), but Britain did not grant the country independence until 1980, when Mugabe took power. In the interim, nationalist militias including Mugabe’s ZANU battled the white settler government in a brutal civil war. There literally was no “Zimbabwe” on the map before Mugabe put it there, and he’s only leaving now because he has lost the support of the army. His party is set to remain in power under new management.

Part of the reason Mugabe lost the army is that he has run the country about as far into the ground as it can bear to go. Corruption and mismanagement under the Mugabe regime — including his theoretically just but economically destructive land reforms that seized white farmers’ property and redistributed it to landless black Zimbabweans — turned the nation from Africa’s agricultural powerhouse of the 20th century to an economic basket case in the 21st. In light of how bad things got under Mugabe, even something less than full democracy would still be a huge improvement over his geronto-kleptocracy.

In other words, even if Mnangagwa doesn’t make Zimbabwe all that much more democratic, if he is more competent, less greedy, and less brutal than Mugabe, that’s still a small win for the country. The Trump administration isn’t likely to make guiding Zimbabwe onto a more democratic course a priority. But even if it did, Zimbabwe’s biggest foreign trade partner, investor, and influence is China, not the U.S.

That’s all the more reason to doubt whether Zimbabwe’s future will be free. China values stability in its African clients, not democracy. It has stood behind ruthless dictators like Qaddafi and Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir as long as they keep handing out oil contracts to Chinese firms. While these relationships have forced Beijing to get more involved in African politics and wars than it had intended, its objectives there remain economic, not political. Mindful of the lessons of Libya, where it paid a price for sticking with Qaddafi and lost those precious contracts after he fell, China won’t stand in the way of Zimbabwe’s deep state replacing the aging Mugabe, but it is unlikely to demand much of Mnangagwa in the way of reform, as long as he keeps the country open for business.","tony karumbaafpgetty

In Call Me by Your Name, the gifted young American actor Timothée Chalamet plays Elio, a 17-year-old who spends summers with his academic parents in their airy, rustic villa in Crema in northern Italy. In early scenes, the skinny, long-waisted Elio seems vaguely uncomfortable in his body, as if uncertain what to do with it apart from the de rigeur canoodling with teenage girls who swim with him in nearby lakes and ponds. It’s only when he stares from his bedroom window at the arrival of this year’s summer guest — a young scholar who’ll spend six weeks reading, writing, and working with the professor — that Elio seems to come out of his own head.

The 24-year-old visitor, Oliver (Armie Hammer), has an easy, almost arrogant physicality. He’s broad-shouldered, slim-hipped, absurdly handsome. But he’s hard to read. Oliver gives the shirtless Elio a quick shoulder massage and then heads off to play volleyball. Was it innocent or a come-on? Whichever, Oliver’s touch lingers. Elio sneaks into Oliver’s room and sticks his nose into a pair of discarded bathing trunks, inhaling sharply. He puts them on his head. He’s in heaven.

Call Me by Your Name takes place in summer, 1983. It has the feel of something recollected in tranquility, but the eroticism is startlingly immediate. The faithful adaptation of André Aciman’s novel is by James Ivory, but the movie has a different feel than Ivory’s own formal, somewhat stiff work. The Italian director Luca Guadagnino creates a mood of free-floating sexual longing. Oliver never wears long pants, only short shorts or swim trunks, and young men are always doffing their shirts and jumping into sparkling water or riding on bicycles along dirt roads. The flesh tones stand out against the villa’s pale whites and yellow walls — more tactile but on a continuum with the sculptures and oil paintings by men with similar longings centuries ago. Call Me by Your Name is hardly the first film set in Italy to juxtapose youth and beauty and fleeting seasons with ancient buildings and ruins. But I can’t recall such a continuum between the ephemeral and the enduring.

I also can’t remember a filmmaker who has captured the essence of midsummer this way, lazy but so vivid that every sound registers. Sound floats in through windows — of insects and birds but mostly wind. The presence of Nature can be felt in every one of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom’s frames. It’s reflected in the bodies of the characters. Oliver is hard for Elio — and us — to read. Is he toying with the teenager? Or is something stirring in him, too? In this atmosphere, how can something not be stirring? There’s friction in the uncertainty, heightened when Oliver dances provocatively with Elio’s kinda-sorta girlfriend. The minutes go by and then we’re into the film’s second hour with everything maddeningly —but thrillingly — undefined.

The love scenes between Elio and Oliver aren’t explicit — they only feel as if they are. The title is said in a moment of passion. It’s Oliver’s fervent desire to dissolve his self, to become one with Elio. I should point out that Armie Hammer doesn’t look 24 — more like 29, which he was during filming, and that changes the dynamic. Make of that what you will (17 was above the age of legal consent in Italy), but it’s Elio who finally pushes Oliver over the brink — who calls the question.

Michael Stuhlbarg plays Elio’s father, an anthropology professor who gazes intently at his son, seems to know what’s happening — and doesn’t interfere. He and Elio have a revelatory conversation near the end, but it’s the very last shot that stays in mind, all but dissolving the boundary between viewer and actor. Everything in Call Me by Your Name registers momentously, from the scene that definitively raises the question, “Do I dare to eat a peach?” to the ’80s dance numbers to the yearning Sufjan Stevens song over the stunning credits. Chalamet gives the performance of the year. By any name, this is a masterpiece.","oliver armie hammer

Craig Jenkins@CraigSJ,"It’s deadly serious, but every message is delivered with a patient and delicate touch.",2017-11-24T15:00:01.22Z,new-york-magazine,The Many Deadly Layers of Björk’s Utopia,http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/review-bjrk-utopia.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/21/21-bjork.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Photo: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images

Björk is one of our premier hyperrealists. Her music and videos induce a striking sense of otherworldliness through elaborate, unfamiliar biology and suspended or distended time. She stretches tempos like taffy and recasts familiar sounds like drum hits and human voices into unsettling new shapes through inventive approaches to melody and programming. Listening very intently to her music can feel like diving deeply into physics. You’re discovering new shapes and designs inside of the normal shapes and designs you’ve grown accustomed to since childhood, cataloguing all of the strange magic hiding in plain sight.

This week’s Utopia arrives two years after the Icelandic singer-producer’s downcast breakup album Vulnicura, and it offers a rejuvenating rush of desire to offset the previous project’s themes of drift and decay. Where on the last release Björk found herself longing for a searchable index of moments of lost intimacy on “History of Touches,” which paired futuristic science and human emotional frailty like Black Mirror’s memory replay daydream “The Entire History of You,” Utopia surveys the finer points of new romance, from profound to mundane. “Feature Creatures” inverts the concept of “History of Touches,” as glimpses of men whose hair and build match the singer’s new crush tide her over till their next meeting.

The idea presented on “Feature Creatures,” that the whole world is reverberating around the inner workings of one couple’s minds and hearts, informs the lyrics and the music of the rest of Utopia. That song’s ocean swell of cooing voices dramatizes the expectant eroticism lurking in the lyrics (“When I spot someone who is same height as you / And goes to same record stores / I literally think, ‘I am five minutes away from love’”) in the same way that the bombastic strings, wind instruments, and nature sounds of “Arisen My Senses” and “Utopia” seem to literally explode out of some fondly remembered kiss or caress. The mixing of human voices and found wilderness sounds with chirping, erratic electronics feels a bit … Disney, like animals and insects sidling up to Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke during Mary Poppins’s “Jolly Holiday.”

Like Walt Disney’s vivid Technicolor landscapes, utopia is a beguiling idea because it imagines a state we’re to understand to be unreachable in this life. Utopia is a goalpost to strive toward, so as much as Björk’s new album is about finding satisfaction in our circumstances, it also pushes us toward the emotional and physical work that will help to get us to a better place. “Courtship” casts a new relationship as a deliberate act of rebuking the bad juju of rejection while warning of the stone-hearted sentries we stand to become if we give up on trying. (“The paralyzing juice of rejection / His veins full of lead / He’s left with loving what he lost / More than what he has.”) “Loss” views heartbreak as an opportunity to rebuild strength and character: “Loss of love, we all have suffered / How we make up for it defines who we are.”

Utopia is as much an act of drafting Björk’s specifications for a comforting future as detailing the nagging conditions of the present that make such fantasy necessary. Unconditional love and the power of music are introduced as expressways to wellness on “Saint” and “Future Forever,” but Björk’s worries as a mother and as an ex-wife fuel the engine carrying her there. “Sue Me” relies on Biblical allegory to send a chilling riposte to a custody suit her ex and former collaborator Matthew Barney sprung on her in the fallout from their 2013 separation: “Like the mother in Solomon’s tale / To spare our girl, I won’t let her get cut in half.” “Tabula Rasa” continues to pray that the next generation will get to live free of the stain of the “fuck-ups of our fathers.”

If this all sounds deadly serious, know that every message is delivered with a patient and delicate touch. “Sue Me” might be the coldest Björk kiss-off this side of “Sod Off,” but the drums and ambience are too lively to catch all of that darkness and determination straight away. So much of this album feels like traversing the bucolic, techno-organic spaces depicted in the video for “The Gate” or else swooning inside the heady inner space of “Blissing Me.” The lyrics are a breadcrumb trail to peaceful enlightenment, but there’s so much more to take in along the way. You can experience Utopia as a vast expanse of intriguing flute, drum, and vocal textures; get lost envisioning the mythical vistas they evoke when stacked on top of each other; or follow Björk on her path to lasting peace. Each approach offers new rewards.","otherworldliness

Matt Zoller Seitz,"Lee does his thing, and you can take it or leave it.",2017-11-22T23:21:54.656Z,new-york-magazine,"Spike Lee’s She’s Gotta Have It Is a Scattered, Playful Remake",http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/shes-gotta-have-it-review.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/22/22-shes-gotta-have-it.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Photo: David Lee/Netflix

The title of Spike Lee’s She’s Gotta Have It now requires a parenthetical: (the movie) or (the Netflix series). The former came out in 1986, the latter debuts Thursday. What’s fascinating about both versions is how loose and playful they are. The original, an 86-minute sex comedy about a free-spirited painter named Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) who refuses to let men define her, was Lee’s debut feature and his pop culture breakthrough. At the time, a number of white critics condescendingly described him as a black Woody Allen, presumably because both filmmakers were skinny and wore glasses and made movies in New York; but there were few other defensible points of comparison, and Woody Allen damn sure never mock-begged the audience to buy tickets to his work, as Lee did in a hilarious trailer that found him standing on a corner selling tube socks, “three fi-dollars.” The movie had a patched-together quality characteristic of many notable American indies from that period, but it compensated with a fresh style and an unprecedented Afrocentric view of middle-class black life.

Lee and his then- (and still best) cinematographer Ernest Dickerson shot Fort Greene as if it were the hippest, most beautiful place on earth, filled the screen with fresh faces, gorgeous bodies, and striking camera angles (including direct address), and stocked the soundtrack with a mixtape of then-current hip hop, rhythm and blues, and original jazz compositions by his father, composer and pianist Bill Lee. The movie’s sexual politics didn’t hold up under scrutiny – more on that in a moment – but this seemed like less of a deal breaker when measured against Lee’s audacity, talent, and relentless determination to make Afrocentric movies set in the real world, on his own unique terms. As Lee’s longtime champion Roger Ebert observed, She’s Gotta Have It was a rare feature about black folks that showed them relating, first and foremost, to one another, without mediating their existence to protect the sensibilities of a hypothetical white audience.

The Netflix version won’t have the same cultural impact, and how could it? Over three decades, Lee inspired countless filmmakers, both visually and in terms of professional philosophy, who are now feature directors or showrunners themselves. This series can’t help but feel like a latecomer to a genre that Lee’s first movie refined and made popular – one that’s now exemplified less by feature films than by web series and shows that started out as web series, like High Maintenance and Insecure. But it’s fun to see Lee, who is almost 60, goofing around and trying out new things as if he’d time warped back to the moment he graduated from film school.

DeWanda Wise plays Nola, our guide and narrator through modern Fort Greene, a less funky, more gentrified place whose rising property values are the subject of much discussion. (Though he’d doubtless be horrified to read this, Lee’s debut might have unthinkingly jump-started gentrification in that neighborhood; a lot of the white homeowners who bought property there in the 90s and aughts were in high school and college when She’s Gotta Have It came out.) Cleo Anthony plays Greer Childs, a preening playboy so cheesy that animated wedges of gruyere should trail him through the frame. He’s mostly a body to Nola, though his apartment is gorgeous, with lots of open space and striking, large-sized photographs, and a stereo system blasting Miles Davis. Anthony Ramos is Mars Blackmon, a motor-mouthed clown of a bike messenger played by Lee in the original movie; Nola likes Mars because he’s unpretentious and makes her laugh, though she gets annoyed when he waxes rhapsodic about her apartment (this show is real-estate porn) and immediately asks if he can move in. Lyriq Bent is Jamie Overstreet, the buppie who presents himself as a thoughtful, sensitive, responsible man but has a controlling streak. Here, as in the movie, it’s not immediately apparent what Nola sees in Jamie, a character who seems to represent the monogamous, woman-as-possession scenario that’s anathema to her. Or maybe on some level it isn’t.

In the pilot, written and directed by Lee, the quadrangle of Nola and her lovers plays out more or less as it did in the original film, but with full color and more acrobatic sex scenes replacing Dickerson’s softcore splash panels of bare backs and breasts and climax-faces. But things detour pretty quickly after that, in ways that detractors of the movie might appreciate. Lee’s debut was criticized even at the time for reveling a bit too obviously in Nola’s sexual availability, in a way that objectified a woman who said she did not want to be objectified; and the rape-as-punishment scene that drove Nola away from one of her lovers, then back into his arms, felt like a repudiation of everything the movie professed to stand for. Lee has been contrite about all this, and belatedly makes amends here by entrusting most of the episode teleplays to women writers (including Radha Blank, Eisa Davis, Lee’s sister Joie Lee, and playwright Lynn Nottage) and replacing the rape with an incident of street assault that becomes defiant fuel for Nola’s art.

More so than a lot of Lee films, and this is saying a lot, She’s Gotta Have It is a hangout movie, built mostly around scenes of people talking in apartments, coffee shops, and on the street. Sometimes the conversations are germane to the plot and sometimes they refer to the culture at large, to American history or race relations or economics, or to the relationship between the series and the people watching it on their TV or laptop or phone (Lee’s fondness for theatrically florid, straight-in-the-camera monologues could be jarring on a big screen in the age of film, but it feels natural in the era of selfies). The series changes tone and genre so often that it’s hard to keep track of all the different iterations that it passes through as you watch it. There’s an explosion, and I mean literal explosion, of scatalogical humor a few episodes in that might give even the Farrelly brothers pause.

For the most part, Netflix’s She’s Gotta Have It finds Lee operating in an entranced, scattered, digressive mode reminiscent of a mid-period work like Girl 6 or Bamboozled, or one of those long scenes in Jungle Fever where the story, such as it is, grinds to a halt so that the characters can discuss social or political issues. or so that Lee can properly worship a bit of architecture or a man or woman’s body, or let a song that he likes finish playing.

There are images, scenes, and devices in this show that I’ve never seen before, including a type of edit that I’m going to dub a “hypertext cut,” where Lee essentially pauses to answer an extra-dramatic question that might have arisen in your mind as you watched (for instance, whenever an original song ends, Lee cuts to a closeup of the album cover!). That’s impressive enough on its own that it overcomes some very circa-1986 Spike Lee declamatory line readings, many clumsy bits of exposition, and a strain of self-congratulation in the form of shoehorned-in references to other Spike Lee joints. Some of these are clever, like a painted “Da Mayor” sign on a stoop that harkens back to Ossie Davis’ role in Do the Right Thing. Others are squirm-inducing, notably a long discussion of the injustice of Al Pacino beating Denzel Washington for the best actor Oscar in the year of Lee’s Malcolm X. This kind of thing would be less irksome if there were, say, 80 percent less of it. But it’s also fascinating, in a back-asswards way, because it shows that Lee is as influenced as ever by Jean-Luc Godard, the French New Wave standard bearer who had a Brechtian and self-referential tendency from the start of his career and started turning subtext into text (sometimes actual text) more often as he got older.

I have no idea if I’m enticing you to watch the show or actively driving you away from it, but that’s Spike Lee for you: He does his thing, and you can take it or leave it, and it’s the take-it-or-leave-it attitude that inclines me to take it.","nola darling tracy camilla johns

Eric Levitz@EricLevitz,"Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, and John McCain know their tax bill isn’t actually deficit neutral. And they might be done playing dumb.",2017-11-24T21:26:59.401Z,new-york-magazine,The GOP’s Lonely Deficit Hawks Just Might Kill the Trump Tax Cuts,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/the-gops-lonely-deficit-hawks-could-kill-the-trump-tax-cuts.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/24/24-jeff-flake.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call,Inc.

Ever since Senate Republicans released a tax bill that includes temporary cuts for middle-class families — and permanent ones for corporate America — GOP leaders have been talking out of both sides of their mouths.

When Democrats scream that the president’s “middle-class tax cut” would actually raise taxes on at least half of middle-income families by 2027, the Republican leadership calls malarky.

Their story goes like this: Everyone knows that those numbers are garbage, because the middle-class tax cuts will never actually expire. Republicans only phased out those tax breaks to comply with arcane budget rules — in the Senate, the tax bill can only evade a Democratic filibuster if it doesn’t add to the deficit in 2028. So, the GOP had to phase out something, just to make the math work. And the party opted to set its most popular proposals (like doubling the standard deduction and expanding the child tax credit) to expire precisely because no future administration — Democratic or Republican — will actually let that happen. In 2012, a Democratic president had a chance to let George W. Bush’s middle-class tax cuts expire. Instead, the Obama administration pushed to make them permanent. And the same show will play out in 2026. So, don’t worry. This bill isn’t actually a deficit-neutral plan to finance a corporate tax cut by soaking the middle class — it’s just a giant, unfunded, across-the-board cut loaded with budget gimmicks that mask its true price!

This is a plausible story — and, perhaps, a politically viable one. But it’s utterly incompatible with the tune that GOP leaders have been singing to their party’s few sincere deficit hawks. And those lonely fiscal scolds know they’re being lied to.

“The savings, the score, it just isn’t valid because you know that they’re not going to follow through,” Arizona senator Jeff Flake said recently. “You can’t assume that we’ll grow a backbone later. If we can’t do it now, then it’s tough to do it later.”

Flake isn’t the only Senate Republican who isn’t crazy about drastically expanding the debt that his party spent the past eight years decrying. As Politico reports:

Flake and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, another independent-minded Republican not running for reelection next year, have been among the most outspoken with their deficit concerns. So too, has Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a major wildcard for GOP leadership in the tax fight.

But other Republicans have gradually become more vocal about their own deficit worries, with Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and James Lankford of Oklahoma among them. GOP leaders can only lose two votes before the tax bill tanks.

“My concern is, if you slow down to actually implement it, that’s one thing,” Lankford said. “But when you assume a sunset on something that you may or may not actually sunset, you may set up other tax fights that you have in the future, or set up additional deficit.”

If McCain, Corker, and Flake want to put fiscal responsibility above upward redistribution, there’s nothing McConnell can do to stop them. The latter two senators are leaving the Senate next year, and the first is, in all likelihood, not long for this Earth. The Senate Majority Leader can’t afford to lose more than two votes. But he also can’t afford to address his deficit hawks’ substantive concerns.

Republicans are ideologically — and financially — committed to radically reducing the tax burdens of corporations, owners of “pass-through” businesses, and heirs to multimillion-dollar estates. And they are politically obligated to avoid dramatically raising taxes on middle-income people — or slashing military or entitlement spending — while doing so.

Thus, the only way for the GOP to square the needs of its donors and voters is to game the budget rules and blow up the deficit. And to do that, they’re gonna need the Senate’s handful of genuine fiscal conservatives to either keep quiet or play dumb.

In recent weeks, Corker and McCain have done the former. The Trump tax cuts will live or die on whether they’re willing to do the latter when silence ceases to be an option.","photo bill clarkcqroll callinc

Austin Knoblauch,The San Francisco 49ers seem like they're more or less comfortable with the idea of Jimmy Garoppolo playing under the one-year franchise tag next season.,2017-11-25T20:58:00Z,nfl-news,Shanahan: Garoppolo playing under tag isn't a big deal,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882478/article/shanahan-garoppolo-playing-under-tag-isnt-a-big-deal,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/25/0ap3000000882481_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"It was apparent from the second the San Francisco 49ers acquired Jimmy Garoppolo that they weren't worried about having to pay him big money -- and it seems they're anticipating Garoppolo likely will play under the franchise tag in 2018.

Speaking on the KNBR-AM Tolbert and Lund Podcast earlier this week, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan indicated that signing Garoppolo to the tag likely makes the most sense and it wouldn't be ""that big of a deal to us.""

""It would be great if it could work out that way [a long-term contract], but that's just not the situation any of us are in,"" Shanahan said, per Eric Branch of the San Francisco Chronicle. ""So you want to play it out. That is the good thing about the franchise tag and that's what, to me, made it an easier decision to trade for him at the time we did...""

It's logical Shanahan and the 49ers wouldn't think twice about shelling out the roughly $25 million it'll take for Garoppolo to play under the one-year tag. It might seem like a hefty price for a quarterback with only two NFL starts, but the 49ers have plenty of salary-cap space (roughly $60 million, per Spotrac) to take out a one-year financial flyer on Garoppolo -- even if he doesn't turn out to be the next Joe Montana or Steve Young.

Shanahan explained the team's mind set about how it approached Garoppolo's contact situation when they traded for him:

""That's what's cool about having something like [the franchise tag]: Hey, all right, I would love to have a guy like that, especially for only a second-round pick. Definitely. Do we have to make a decision this fast for the future in terms of a long-term deal and everything? No, you don't. If you do, and it works out, and you feel great about it, that's awesome. But if not, that's why the rules are the way they are.""

It's anyone's guess as to whether Garoppolo will see any playing time this season as he continues to acclimate to Shanahan's offensive system. C.J. Beathard remains the 49ers' starter for now and it'll be interesting to see what he might be able to accomplish against a battered Seahawks secondary on Sunday.

For now, Shanahan doesn't seem in any rush to have Garoppolo prove something. Shanahan isn't interested in over-reving his new offensive muscle car in hopes of figuring out if he's worthy of a long-term contract, a franchise tag or (gasp!) is a QB lemon.

""It's not something where you want to put all this pressure on him, on the organization, on the players around him where it's like, 'Hey, we're going to get this deal done, this long-term deal, you've got six games to prove it. You better go out there and do it or you won't get what you think you're worth,'"" Shanahan said. ""That's not right to me for us. That's not right for him.""","steve young shanahan

Thomas Warren,"The Oakland Raiders are looking to get back on track, and Beast Mode might provide the answer. Coach Jack Del Rio says the team wants to push the running back and get him more opportunities.",2017-11-25T19:39:00Z,nfl-news,Marshawn Lynch could see more snaps for Raiders,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882479/article/marshawn-lynch-could-see-more-snaps-for-raiders,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/25/0ap3000000882475_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Sunday could be the day Raider nation gets the break out, Beast Mode-type game from Marshawn Lynch they've been waiting with baited breath all season to see.

The veteran running back has been held in check through the first 11 weeks not so much by opposing defenses but a lack of touches. The Raiders have run the ball the fewest times in the league (214 attempts), with Lynch accounting for 97 carries, though he's run for 390 yards with a respectable four yards-per-carry average. If not for the Raiders getting torched early in last week's 33-8 loss to the Patriots in Mexico City, the 10-year veteran was on pace for his first 100-yard game as a Raider (11 carries, 67 yards).

Head coach Jack Del Rio said theyâll make a concerted effort to get Lynch involved early and often Sunday.

""I'd like to push him and get him a little more,"" Del Rio told the Mercury News. ""Obviously, that's a matter of us doing things that I spoke to earlier in the week with getting the possessions offensively, converting on third down which allows more possession, more snaps and opportunities. That's a big part of it.""

They'll look to be more efficient against a Broncos defense that only allows 3.3 yards per carry and might've regained its footing last week holding the Bengals to 190 total yards in a 20-17 win.

The Raiders' offensive line will need to find some consistency if their Lynch-heavy game plan will be successful. It doesn't help that right guard Gabe Jackson is battling an ankle injury that kept him out of practice all week and has him listed as questionable for the game.

Raiders offensive coordinator Todd Downing points to the Dolphins game in Week 9 as a sample of how explosive Lynch can still be when he's running with his trademark violent style. He finished that game with 57 rushing yards, including his a 22-yard scamper for a touchdown.

""We were trying to get him rocking and rolling,"" Downing said, adding, ""I'm pleased with where he's at. Hoping to be able to feed him a little bit more.""

The Raiders have seemingly saved Lynch for the stretch run with the playoffs in mind, and if they want to stay in the hunt, it's time to let Beast Mode run free.","marshawn lynch

Thomas Warren,"When the Arizona Cardinals and Jacksonville Jaguars square off Sunday, a battle for hometown bragging rights will be taking place between Tyrann Mathieu and Leonard Fournette.",2017-11-25T17:37:00Z,nfl-news,"Tyrann Mathieu, Leonard Fournette to revive rivalry",http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882473/article/tyrann-mathieu-leonard-fournette-to-revive-rivalry,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/25/0ap3000000882482_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"When the Arizona Cardinals and Jacksonville Jaguars square off Sunday, a battle for hometown bragging rights will be taking place between Tyrann Mathieu and Leonard Fournette.

""It's going to be pretty fun for me,"" Mathieu told Darren Urban of the Cardinals' official website. ""I come from the same neighborhood but I never had a chance to play with him. It was always, 'What if those two played against each other?'""

That day will come Sunday, so long as Fournette is healthy. The Jaguars first-round pick has been limited in practice all week with an ankle injury he's long dealt with, and that kept him out Week 7 against the Colts.

The rivalry is not a bitter one, as the two New Orleans natives are admittedly close friends. One could even say the elder Mathieu -- by three years -- set the football path that the younger Fournette followed to the NFL. They're both graduates of St. Augustine High School in the city's Seventh Ward, and they each enjoyed college football superstardom at LSU before entering the pro ranks.

""When Tyrann made it, he kind of made it a reality for everybody that's from New Orleans to make it to the league,"" Fournette told the Cardinals' official website before the draft.

It's not likely their friendship will prevent the 6-foot-1, 228-pound Fournette from lowering his shoulder on the 5-foot-9, 186-pound Mathieu given the chance.

The Honey Badger, on the flip side, plans to use their history to his advantage.

""I'm probably going to try and get in his head, but he's level-headed for the most part,"" Mathieu said. ""He doesn't really get into it like that. But I know if I get under his skin, he's going to give me something back.""

Fournette will look to help his Jaguars extend their winning streak to five games and create distance for themselves in the AFC South with the Titans sitting a game back. If that's going to happen, it'll likely be a busy day for Fournette who ranks third in the league in carries per game (21.9) and second in rushing yards per game (92.5).

Mathieu understands what his defense is in for.

""I know he'll give us his best shot and I know he'll get the ball 40 times. That's 40 times we've got to put our big-boy pads on.""","jacksonville jaguars

Austin Knoblauch,The Buffalo Bills will try rediscover their winning mojo without Kelvin Benjamin on Sunday. The wide receiver will not play against the Kansas City Chiefs because of a knee injury.,2017-11-25T16:59:00Z,nfl-news,Kelvin Benjamin ruled out for Buffalo Bills vs. Chiefs,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882471/article/kelvin-benjamin-ruled-out-for-buffalo-bills-vs-chiefs,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/25/0ap3000000882469_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The Buffalo Bills will try to rediscover their winning mojo without Kelvin Benjamin.

A day after initially listing the wide receiver as questionable to play Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Bills downgraded Benjamin to out on Saturday. Benjamin's lingering knee injury kept him out of practice all week, and it seemed the original questionable designation was a bit of a stretch based on what was seen from him this week.

Benjamin suffered the injury on the fourth snap of the game after making a 20-yard catch in the short-lived Nathan Peterman offense against the Los Angeles Chargers last week. He was carted off and didn't return to the game.

With Benjamin sidelined, the Bills will hope tight end Charles Clay (knee) and wide receivers Jordan Matthews (knee) and Deonte Thompson (ankle) will be good to go after being listed as questionable Friday.

The Tyrod Taylor-led Bills will need all the healthy bodies they can get on offense as they look to snap their three-game losing streak against a equally hungry Chiefs squad.","los angeles chargers

After being accused by Ha Ha Clinton-Dix that he was trying to intentionally injure Clark during last week's Baltimore Ravens-Green Bay Packers contest, Jensen said he's on good terms with the Packers defensive tackle after exchanging text messages with him this week.

""[Clark] texted me back and goes, 'I respect you reaching out to me, and I'll be good. I know you weren't trying to hurt me,'"" Jensen told reporters Friday, per ESPN's Jamison Hensley.

Clark suffered an ankle injury while being blocked by the Ravens center late in the game. Clinton-Dix believed Jensen was trying to injure Clark by ""dragging [him] into the ground while his legs were tucked under him."" Clinton-Dix described Jensen as ""trash"" and a ""bad player.""

""It is what it is,"" Jensen said about Clinton-Dix's remarks. ""Guys are having each others' backs. It doesn't bother me all that much.""

As for Clark, the injury has left him listed as doubtful for Sunday night's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers after not practicing all week.","jamison hensley clark

Thomas Warren,"After a blistering start to his NFL career, Cleveland Browns rookie defensive end Myles Garrett has cooled a little bit. Coach Hue Jackson wants to see Garrett ""dominate the game.""",2017-11-25T15:24:00Z,nfl-news,Hue Jackson wants to see Myles Garrett 'dominate',http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882456/article/hue-jackson-wants-to-see-myles-garrett-dominate,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/25/0ap3000000882457_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"After a blistering start to his NFL career, first-overall pick Myles Garrett has fallen back to earth a bit, and coach Hue Jackson wants to see a return of the explosive defensive end who recorded four sacks in his first three games.

""Go dominate the game,"" Jackson said Friday, according to Cleveland.com. ""That's what he's here for. Losing Emmanuel [Ogbah] is a tough blow. At the same time, Myles is talented enough to go do what he needs to do. Everybody knows that, so everybody's going to be shooting to make sure he does not. His charge has to be you have to go find a way.""

Garrett is sack-less the last two weeks, but it's not just taking down the quarterback that Jackson wants to see from the player the Browns plan to build their defense around.

""The guy is playing extremely hard,'' said Jackson. ""He's played well. Obviously, we want more sacks. He wants more sacks, but he needs to go make more splash plays, and I think he will.""

To be fair, Garrett has battled an ankle injury that kept him out of the Week 8 matchup in London against the Vikings and sidelined him the first four weeks of the season.

Still, while the sack numbers haven't been impressive, the Texas A&M product hasn't exactly been a bump on a log out there. He's managed 15 quarterback pressures in 87 pass-rushing plays from the right side of the line, according to Pro Football Focus.

""Just haven't been doing enough,'' Garrett said. ""I've been getting there but just not quick enough. The other guys have been making those big plays.""

Despite the Browns' 0-10 start, the defense ranks in the top 10 overall and has held its own against the competition, but Garrett understands that his draft status comes with pressure to be the tone-setter.

""He's right,'' said Garrett. ""I need to make my presence known. I need to have a play or a couple of plays each game where I change the course of the game.""

Cleveland's season might be a lost cause at this point, but if Garrett can stay on the field the last six games, we could see why many believe he'll be a premier pass rusher for years to come.","the

Speaking to reporters Friday, Carroll said ""there will be some clarity"" soon regarding whether Kam Chancellor and Cliff Avril will play again this season.

""We are just respecting their process and what is right for them and so we just continue to kind of just report where they are right now and leave it at that,"" Carroll said Friday, per Bob Condotta of The Seattle Times. ""There will be some things happening before too long. I know that is not what you want to hear and you want to know more, but that is just kind of the way we are handling it to help them.""

It appears the Seahawks are still trying to determine whether Chancellor's neck injury will indeed keep him out for the remainder of the season. As NFL Network's Mike Garafolo first reported last week, Chancellor is expected to miss the rest of the year -- a devastating blow for a Richard Sherman-depleted secondary that had a rough night in Monday's loss to the Atlanta Falcons.

Avril also is dealing with a neck injury that landed him on injured reserve last month. He's eligible to be activated after Seattle's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Dec. 10. The Seahawks, however, haven't indicated that will be an option for Avril, whose injury was originally described as career-threatening. They also might be hoping to use their IR-to-return designations on running backs Chris Carson and C.J. Prosise.

With the Seahawks entering a critical stretch after losing two of their last three, it makes sense Seattle wants to be perfectly clear on whether or not two of its best players will indeed be shelved for the remainder of the season.","atlanta falcons avril

Austin Knoblauch,"Greg Olsen is healthy and will play in Sunday's game against the New York Jets, but Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera says the team will take it ""judiciously"" in how much playing time he gets.",2017-11-25T13:25:00Z,nfl-news,Carolina Panthers will be 'smart' in Greg Olsen's return,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000882451/article/carolina-panthers-will-be-smart-in-greg-olsens-return,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/11/25/0ap3000000882452_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"A cornerstone of the Carolina Panthers' offense will be back on the field Sunday.

Greg Olsen, who hasn't played since suffering a broken foot in Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills, was activated off injured reserve Friday and will play against the New York Jets.

""It's exciting,"" coach Ron Rivera said about Olsen's return, per Max Henson of the team's official website. ""He's obviously a part of what we do, and we haven't had him for a while. We just feel good about getting him back, especially going into this final stretch of the season.""

The return of the Pro Bowl tight end should give the Cam Newton-led Panthers offense an added boost as the team looks to usurp the New Orleans Saints in the NFC South over the final portion of the season. Sunday's game against the Jets presents a good opportunity for Olsen to get back up to speed before Carolina embarks on a slate of important games against the Saints, Vikings, Packers, Buccaneers and Falcons.

The comeback plan for Olsen on Sunday involves a measured dose of work.

""We're going to try to do it judiciously,"" Rivera said. ""We've got to save him from himself and save him from us. You get a guy like that, you want to keep him out there as much as you can. But just knowing his conditioning and football shape isn't where it needs to be right now. ... You don't want to throw Greg out there and have him go 60 plays. So we really have to be smart.""

Still, we could see Olsen make a little history in his first game back. The 11th-year pro, who has 7,393 career receiving yards, is only 19 yards away of passing former Philadelphia Eagles standout Pete Retzlaff for seventh all-time in career yards among tight ends.

Playing smart and judiciously has helped revive the Panthers after last year's disappointments. Having Olsen back on the field for the stretch run could go a long way in establishing Carolina as a very real threat in the NFC beyond the regular season.

What to Watch For

In what could turn into a shootout in Atlanta's shiny new building, Ryan Fitzpatrick could be required to toss the ball a ton into a speedy Falcons defense. The matchup to watch is Mike Evans versus Desmond Trufant. The receiver bounced back from his suspension with a big game last week and gets a stiff test against a stingy Trufant. Evans has earned 10 targets in three of the past four games and should surpass that number Sunday. If Matt Ryan lights up the Bucs secondary, Tampa will need Fitzpatrick and Evans to respond in kind to keep the game close.

Matt Ryan has a juicy matchup against a struggling Bucs pass defense that could help him continue to put his early-season struggles in the rearview mirror. The Falcons QB has completed 67.9 percent of his passes for a 104.9 passer rating and 9-2 TD-INT ratio in the past five games. The bad interception luck early in the season certainly played a role in the offensive problems, but Ryan looks more comfortable with Steve Sarkisian's play-calling in recent weeks. Against a Tampa defense that is giving up 276.3 passing yards per game (31st in NFL), Ryan should find plus matchups with Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu when they aren't being covered by Brent Grimes.

NFL Research stat of the week: Julio Jones has the fewest TD receptions this season (1) among the 21 players with 600-plus receiving yards. Julio has been targeted 13 times in the end zone -- fourth-most in the NFL (Dez Bryant led the league with 16 entering Week 12).

Can the Browns get their first win of the season over the instate-rival in what could be the last best chance to get off the schneid? Getting Duke Johnson going will be key for Cleveland's offense versus a Bengals D that is better than their stats indicate. Run game coordinator Kirby Wilson said he wants to get Johnson the ball ""as much as possible"" Sunday (it took 10 games to realize that?). Johnson faces a good Cincy run defense but has an advantage as a pass-catcher out of the backfield against a Bengals team that has allowed 63 receptions and 455 receiving yards to running backs. If Johnson can break a few long plays, it could be the difference in what stacks up as a low-scoring affair in Ohio.

Injuries have begun to decimate what had been a stout Browns run defense early in the season, allowing the Lions and Jags to go off the past two games. Can the Bengals take advantage? Behind an offensive line that struggles to open holes for Joe Mixon, Cincinnati is averaging 68.0 rushing yards per game (last in NFL), which would be worst for a full season since the 2000 Chargers (66.4 rush YPG) and 2000 Browns (67.8 rush YPG). Mixon has just two games of 50-plus rushing yards and none since the Week 5. With a stagnant offense debilitated by the offensive line, Cincinnati needs Mixon to make defenders miss in the hole Sunday and pop off his first big day as a pro.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Browns have started 0-10 for the second straight season, becoming the third team since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to start 0-10 in back-to-back years: Houston Oilers, 1983 and 1984; Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 1976 and 1977.

The Titans had a season-low 52 rushing yards in Week 11 but face a defense this week that they ran over in Week 6 -- Derrick Henry: 19 carries, 131 rush yards (career high), one rushing TD. Marcus Mariota was hobbled in the last meeting against Indy but still had one of his best passing days. A healthy quarterback should help open running lanes for Henry and DeMarco Murray once again. When last we saw Mariota it wasn't his legs that were the problem, but rather a few airmailed passes and communication issues with receivers. Against a Colts defense that has played better in recent weeks, Mariota must bounce back to keep the Titans within earshot of the Jaguars in the AFC South.

Despite all the chaos swirling around him, Jacoby Brissett has performed admirably this season. The Colts QB is averaging 235.7 pass YPG as a starter. That's more than Marcus Mariota: 232.1 pass YPG (9 starts); Cam Newton: 223.2 pass YPG (10 starts); Eli Manning: 219.18 pass YPG (11 starts); and Dak Prescott: 210.7 pass YPG (11 starts). Brissett also is the AFC South's top passer in yards per game, TD-INT ratio and passer rating. The big-armed quarterback has a prime matchup to torch a Titans secondary ranked 26th in pass DVOA by Football Outsiders. In the previous meeting, Brissett got off to a hot start but fizzled under the pressure packages brought by Tennessee defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau. Will Brissett display improved recognition and mettle in the face of the pressure this time?

NFL Research stat of the week: Brissett has a higher passer rating in his first 11 career starts (86.7) than Andrew Luck did in his first 11 career starts (76.5).

Going going, back back, to Tryod Tyrod. The Buffalo Bills had little choice but to hand the reins back to Tyrod Taylor after last week's Nathan Peterman test run blew up in their face like an ill-designed fifth-grade volcano experiment. Taylor gives the Bills the best chance to keep their fading playoff hopes alive against a Chiefs defense that has been gutted in recent weeks. The quarterback's mobility should be on display early against a K.C. defense that struggles against running QBs. The threat of Taylor running should also open wide lanes for LeSean McCoy to have a big day versus the No. 32-ranked DVOA run defense.

Since Week 8, Kareem Hunt has earned a meager 156 rushing yards and 206 scrimmage yards after leading the league in both categories in the first seven weeks. The rookie running back gets a prime bounce-back matchup against a Bills defense that has been trampled in the last three games, giving up 212.7 rushing yards per tilt. Despite his recent struggles, Hunt has seen 21-plus touches in three of the past four games. Andy Reid should ride the rookie Sunday against Buffalo. As the weather turns, and Alex Smith reverts to his check-down ways, Hunt can be the reason the Chiefs ride into the playoffs.

NFL Research stat of the week: This season marked the fifth time since 2000 that the Bills were above .500 through eight games. They went 10-24 in the second halves of those seasons (including 2017), missing the playoffs each previous time.

On paper, this is a massive blowout waiting to happen. The Dolphins have been outscored 142-65 during their four-game losing streak. Matt Moore will get the start in place of Jay Cutler (concussion), but isn't a buffo option against a Patriots defense that has found itself allowing 12.5 points per game over the last six outings. Expect Moore to target his favorite receiver, Jarvis Landry, heavily in hopes to pop some big plays. The Dolphins' passing offense has improved since the Jay Ajayi trade, averaging 295.7 yards per game (Miami has also trailed big in each matchup). Landry and Kenny Stills will need to blaze the Patriots' secondary if they want to keep pace with Tom Brady. Moore is willing to let it fly, which can lead to a bevy of interceptions or big plays depending on whether his receivers can make a play on the ball in Foxborough.

Brady is the only QB averaging more than 300-plus pass YPG and leads the NFL in passer rating (110.9). The MVP leader should add to those numbers against a crumbling Dolphins defense that has allowed 27-plus points in their last five games. The Brady-Brandin Cooks connection should fly high once again, especially with Chris Hogan still out. Brady targeted Cooks 20 times over the last two weeks for 223 total yards on 12 catches. Miami's 31st-ranked DVOA pass defense stands little chance of slowing down the growing connection.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Dolphins have never defeated the Patriots in New England in a game Brady started and finished -- only win in New England since 2001 was Week 17, 2005, when Brady only played in first quarter (NE already clinched division). Miami has lost eight straight road games vs. New England (outscored by 146 pts). The Dolphins' last win in New England was Week 3, 2008 -- Chad Pennington (MIA) vs Matt Cassel (NE).

As Cam Newton goes, so go the Carolina Panthers. In the seven Panthers wins, Newton has a 102.0 passer rating. In the three losses, Cam has a 47.4 passer rating. With his swagger flying high coming off a bye, it should be another good day versus a Jets defense that is stout versus the run but can be picked on through the air. The return of tight end Greg Olsen should pay immediate dividends for Newton, who has been lacking his security blanket since Week 2. With a monotonous cast of receivers outside of Devin Funchess, Olsen should see a healthy number of targets against a Jets defense that has allowed 523 yards and six touchdowns to tight ends.

Josh McCown's 69.0 completion percentage puts him on pace to set the franchise record (Chad Pennington, 68.9 percent in 2002). Think about this: In the span of three years, Ryan Fitzpatrick and McCown could set Jets quarterback records (mind explodes). McCown has a tough matchup against a Panthers defense that has been laying the wood, raking in the top eight in DVOA versus the run and the pass. The matchup to watch is Robby Anderson versus the Panthers' secondary. The big-play receiver gets his toughest matchup since going up against Jacksonville in Week 4. McCown needs Anderson to make plays versus the Panthers' zone in what could be a low-scoring affair at MetLife.

NFL Research stat of the week: Carolina earned back-to-back games with 200-plus rush yards for the first time in team history.

Hammer, meet iron sled. The Chicago Bears want to run Jordan Howard 20-plus times a game. He's averaging 21.5 carries per tilt and 98.2 rushing yards per game with Mitchell Trubisky in the lineup. Howard -- who needs 14 rushing yards to pass Matt Forte for the most in a player's first two seasons in Bears history (currently at 2,154) -- faces the Eagles top-ranked run defense (71.0 yards per game allowed). If Howard is stymied early, will coach John Fox abandon the run game, or keep bashing his head against the iron wall? Trubisky showed some moxie last week but faces a much better defense this time around. The rookie quarterback has yet to put together a complete game. Asking him to do it against the NFL's top team, on the road, could be a recipe for disaster.

The football world is rightfully fawning over Carson Wentz. But the truly remarkable aspect of the Eagles' offense is the way they spread the ball around. Philly doesn't have a single player ranked in the top 25 in receiving yards -- Alshon Jeffery is T-26th in NFL with 567 receiving yards -- and have no single-game 100-yard receivers. Similarly, the Eagles have only one 100-yard rusher this year -- LeGarrette Blount: 136 rush yards in Week 4 vs. Chargers. Instead of relying on one or two players to move the ball, Philly brings four running backs and allows Wentz to spread the ball to a bevy of receivers and tight ends. The depth makes it incredibly difficult for defenses to matchup with personnel and key on certain players. Sunday against the Bears' secondary should be no different for Wentz & Co.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Eagles have scored 20-plus points in 14 straight games dating back to last season (longest active streak in NFL). They are the only team to score 20-plus points in every game this season and have 20-plus points in 23 of 26 games with Wentz at QB (T-most since 2016).

Should we petition to change the Seahawks name to the ""Seattle Wilsons""? Russell Wilson has accounted for 82.8 percent of Seattle's scrimmage yards, the highest percentage of any player in the Super Bowl era. It's not just his magic through the air. Wilson is on pace to be just the fifth QB since the merger to lead his team in rushing yards for a season. It's astounding how much pressure is on Wilson's shoulders each week. While it doesn't seem sustainable for the long-haul, the quarterback should dice up a limp 49ers defense. The matchup bodes well for the Wilson-Jimmy Graham connection to continue its hot streak. The Niners' defense, which has lost two starting safeties, has been torched by tight ends the past five weeks.

C.J. Beathard is coming off his best performance of the season before the bye -- 76.0 completion percentage, 288 yards passing, 123.4 passer rating, two TDs, one INT-- and gets a chance to double down versus a banged-up Seattle defense. Without Richard Sherman (who lines up primarily on the offense's right side), the Falcons targeted the right side of the field more than any other section in Week 11 (37.0 percent of pass attempts). It's folly to assume Beathard will have similar success considering the cast of pass-catchers he's throwing to. With Carlos Hyde facing a stingy Seahawks run game, the 49ers' best bet is to let Beathard try to pick on the injured secondary. Hitting Marquise Goodwin for a couple of big plays -- or a few DPIs -- is the best recipe for Beathard to move the ball.

NFL Research stat of the week: Wilson is on pace for 4,482 passing yards and 602 rushing yards. He would become the first player in NFL history with 4,400-plus passing yards and 500-plus rushing yards in a season.

Sunday's matchup at the Coliseum features two of the NFL's top three scoring offenses (Rams No. 2, Saints No. 3). In what should be the best game of the day, we could have fireworks in L.A.

Against a Rams defense that got gashed on the ground in Minnesota last week, expect the Mark Ingram/Alvin Kamara combo to find running room up the gut. Ingram and Kamara are combining for 192.5 scrimmage YPG this season, powering a potent Saints attack. As we saw last week, when the Saints can always activate the Drew Brees card and flip the switch to a pass-first plan if necessary. The Rams own the No. 3 DVOA pass defense, but are slightly banged up, which could give Michael Thomas free lanes to roam. The second-year receiver is quietly having a stellar season, ranking eighth in the NFL in receiving yards (753). If Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips sells out to slow Ingram and Kamara, Thomas could explode Sunday.

Head coach Sean McVay's offense hit a snag last week against the Vikings. He faces a Saints defense that ranks third in scoring since Week 3 (16.4 PPG). New Orleans will be without corner stud rookie Marshon Lattimore and starter Ken Crawley, however, which could cripple the secondary. With receiver Robert Woods out, the pressure is ramped up for Sammy Watkins and Cooper Kupp to fill the void on intermediate routes. Given the Woods injury and the matchup against the Saints 26th-ranked DVOA run defense, I expect McVay to ride Todd Gurley heavily. The running back was shut down last week but should burst out. Handing the ball to Gurley 20-plus times will move the chains and help protect the Rams' defense.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Saints (first) and Rams (second) are the NFL's top two teams in big plays this season (Big play: Rush of 10-plus yards or reception of 20-plus yards). Saints: 86 big plays (8.6 per game). Rams: 77 big plays (7.7 per game).

Blaine Gabbert Revenge!

After washing out as the Jaguars' No. 10 overall pick, Gabbert returns faces his former team with a chance to show his growth. Against a smothering Jags defense, however, it could be Jacksonville fans who get the last laugh. The Jaguars have allowed nine or fewer points in six games (most in NFL) -- no other team has more than three such games. Jalen Ramsey doesn't expect to play, but Jacksonville has enough defensive weapons to overcome Gabbert. The key matchup for the Cards will be Larry Fitzgerald versus slot corner Aaron Colvin. Gabbert displayed a willingness to force the ball to Fitzy last week, and it will be his best option against a fast, sack-happy Jags defense once again. Oh, and speaking of revenge games: Calais Campbell returns to the desert to face his former team, which badly misses the game-wrecking defensive lineman.

Facing a pass-funnel Cardinals D, can Blake Bortles win another road game placed on his shoulders? Going head-to-head (proverbially) with Gabbert is an interesting circumstance for the maligned Bortles, who has played better for spurts this season, but remains inconsistent. With Patrick Peterson likely shadowing Marqise Lee, Bortles will need to continue to grow his connection with rookie Dede Westbrook, who has a favorable matchup versus the Cards' No. 2 and 3 corners. Westbrook had a solid debut last week and could be in for an explosive day if Bortles can find the range.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Jaguars can become just the third team in the last 25 seasons to lead the NFL in scoring defense and takeaways. The last two teams to accomplish the feat won Super Bowl titles (2013 Seahawks, 2000 Ravens).

It's finally Paxton Lynch's turn. After getting beaten out by Trevor Siemian this summer and then suffering an injury, the woebegone Broncos turn to their first-round pick to try and find a spark. While getting beaten out by Siemian says plenty about where Lynch was in his development this offseason, it's the right time to give him a shot. The second-year pro looked lost in limited reps last year, but his athleticism will be a net positive behind a porous offensive line. He also faces an awful Raiders pass defense that has a new defensive coordinator. Oakland's 72.3 opposing completion percentage and 113.3 opposing passer rating are both the second-highest allowed since the 1970 merger. Speaking of coordinator changes, how will Bill Musgrave (the Raiders former play-caller) change the playbook after taking over for fired Broncos offensive coordinator Mike McCoy?

In the battle of two of the most disappointing teams in the NFL, the Raiders' offense needs to wake out of a season-long funk. Oakland has lost two of their last three games by 20-plus points and scored fewer than 20 points in each of their six losses. There are few favorable matchups for Derek Carr's offense, even against a Denver defense that has dipped of late. Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree have struggled against Broncos cornerbacks. The Denver run defense is a poor matchup for Marshawn Lynch. The best matchup for Carr to move the ball is tight end Jared Cook, who faces a Denver D allowing 758 yards (second most in the NFL) and seven TDs to tight ends. If Carr can get Cook going early, as he did in the Week 9 win, it could open the rest of the offense. I also want to see if the Raiders deploy Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington in the passing game, similar to the way the Patriots burned the Broncos' defense.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Broncos' defense has fallen from the NFL's No. 4 scoring defense (in 2016) to tied for 27th (in 2017). Coach Vance Joseph's defense also ranks T-18th in sacks per game (T-3rd last year), 28th in passer rating allowed (first in 2016), and 31st in takeaways per game (T-7th).

The Brett Hundley rollercoaster chugs on to Pennsylvania in prime time against one of the best defenses in the NFL. Only one QB has a higher interception rate than Hundley (4.4 percent): DeShone Kizer (5.0 percent). Pittsburgh's defense owns the third-highest INT rate (3.8 percent) and ranks second in sacks. It could be a long night for the Packers QB, who continues to struggle with pressure. As bad as the interceptions and sacks have been for Hundley, he does show an ability, at times, to know where to go with the ball pre-snap. Hundley must get the ball out quick versus the Steelers menacing interior pass rush or it will be another dismal day for the Aaron Rodgers-less Packers.

Sunday night shapes up as another smash spot for Ben Roethlisberger against a porous Packers pass defense, which ranks 23rd in DVOA. With JuJu Smith-Schuster ruled out, expect Roethlisberger to force throws toward Antonio Brown. The All-Pro receiver leads the NFL with 70 receptions and 1,026 receiving yards. Coming off a three-touchdown game, Brown is a good bet to find pay dirt again in prime time. With JuJu out, it will be interesting to see how much trust Big Ben puts in Martavis Bryant. The maligned receiver has let down his quarterback repeatedly this season, but against this Green Bay secondary, perhaps the light will turn on for the athletic deep-threat.

NFL Research stat of the week: Le'Veon Bell's 3.8 yards per carry would be his lowest average since his rookie season (4.7-plus in each of last three seasons). Bell has earned fewer than 4.0 yards per carry in four straight games. His 3.8 yards per carry average would be the lowest average by any player to lead the NFL in rushing yards since the 1970 merger. If he stays at this rate, Bell would be the first player to lead NFL in rushing while averaging fewer than 4.0 yards per carry since Floyd Little in 1971 (3.99 with DEN).

Tom Savage versus the ball-hawking Ravens defense, which pitched their third shutout of the season last week, is a recipe for disaster. The one saving grace for the turnover-prone quarterback is his willingness to target DeAndre Hopkins regardless of the coverage. Hopkins leads the NFL with nine receiving TDs. His matchup versus the pick-happy Ravens secondary is the one to watch. If Baltimore smothers Nuk, the Texans' operation could implode under the bright lights.

Joe Flacco is on the list of most disappointing veteran quarterbacks this season, and he has yet to throw for more than 261 yards in a game. Flacco owns one of the league's lowest-rated passers (74.4), ahead of only DeShone Kizer (54.0), Brett Hundley (63.3) and C.J. Beathard (70.8). Flacco's 5.44 passing yards per attempt is the lowest by a qualified QB since Blaine Gabbert (5.36) in 2011. Facing a Texans secondary that has been torched by opposing quarterbacks, the Ravens need Flacco to have his best game of the year. Expect Jeremy Maclin to see a bevy of targets, as Houston has been diced up by slot receivers. Mike Wallace should likewise see a few deep shots against a Texans defense often burned deep. First, the Ravens will need to block game-wrecker Jadeveon Clowney.

NFL Research stat of the week: The Ravens are the first team since the 2000 Baltimore squad to record three shutouts over the first 10 games of a season. The 2000 Ravens and 1991 Redskins (both won Super Bowls) are the only other teams in the last 30 seasons with three shutouts over the first 10 games.","arizona regardless of stantons status golden and penny

Their starting quarterback, Jay Cutler, is still in concussion protocol and has been ruled out for Sunday's intradivisional contest with the New England Patriots.

Moore has played in three games this season, totaling 646 passing yards, three TDs and three INTs. In his lone start, Miami lost 40-0 to Baltimore on Thursday Night Football, and Moore threw two picks.

Moore filled in for Ryan Tannehill last season when the Dolphins finished the season with a Week 17 loss to the Patriots. Moore finished with 205 yards, two TDs and an interception.","intradivisional

Mike G. Morreale,Two away from joining brother Henrik Sedin as only players to reach milestone with Canucks,2017-11-25T17:05:57Z,nhl-news,"Daniel Sedin on verge of 1,000 points",https://www.nhl.com/news/canucks-daniel-sedin-nearing-1000-points/c-293351402,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293351454/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The forward, who has 998 points (375 goals, 623 assists) in 17 seasons with Vancouver, can join his twin brother, Henrik Sedin, as the only players to score 1,000 points with the Canucks.

NEWARK, N.J. -- Daniel Sedin will have a chance at history when the Vancouver Canucks play the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden on Sunday (2 p.m. ET; SN, MSG, NHL.TV).

But don't expect a big celebration from Daniel when he gets there.

""When [the record] happens, it happens,"" said the 37-year-old, who had a goal and an assist in a 3-2 loss to the New Jersey Devils on Friday. ""I think this year is obviously a little different with my role on the team, so it can happen next game or happen in six games, but we'll take it when it happens.""

Video: VAN@NJD: D. Sedin banks puck in from below goal line

His teammates likely won't be as subdued.

""I'll be pretty pumped and celebrating hard when he gets it,"" forward Jake Virtanen said. ""Both Sedins are legends, and people don't give them the credit they deserve, but they've played a lot of tough games. When together, they're almost unstoppable with how they pass to each other; it's pretty special to watch.""

In addition to Henrik Sedin, five active NHL players have reached 1,000 points: Jaromir Jagr of the Calgary Flames, Joe Thornton of the San Jose Sharks, Patrick Marleau of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals, and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

""I've said a lot of times [Daniel and Henrik Sedin] are Hall of Fame hockey players and Hall of Fame people,"" Canucks coach Travis Green said. ""[Daniel] is going to get those two points, we know that, and it'll be a nice accomplishment. He's been in the League a long time and has done a lot of great things.""

Daniel's best season was 2010-11, his 10th in the League. He won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL scoring leader with 104 points (41 goals, 63 assists). The Canucks have gone to a younger and faster lineup in this first season under Green, and as a result the Sedins have seen their ice time diminish. Daniel averaged 18:03 last season and is averaging 14:02 this season; Henrik averaged 19:02 last season and is averaging 14:05 this season.

""They're not playing as much as they once were, but just having been around them and what they mean for that franchise and that city, it has always been the twins,"" said Devils goalie Cory Schneider, who played five seasons for Vancouver before he was traded to New Jersey on June 30, 2013. ""That kind of consistency and the way you represent your team and organization means a lot, so I think they could be Hall of Famers one day.""

When Henrik scored his 1,000th NHL point against the Florida Panthers on Jan. 21 last season, a goal on that Daniel assisted, he became the 38th player to do so with one NHL franchise and the fourth Sweden-born player to reach the milestone, joining Mats Sundin (1,349), Daniel Alfredsson (1,157) and Nicklas Lidstrom (1,142).

Henrik scored his 1,000th point (233 goals, 767 assists) in his 1,213th game in his 16th season and has 1,031 points (239 goals, 792 assists) in 1,271 games.

Video: VAN@PHI: D. Sedin beats Neuvirth on breakaway

""When it happened to me, I don't think I realized how big a thing it was until it happened, and I'm sure it'll be the same for him,"" he said.

Schneider said that though Daniel will reach the milestone, he will remember him and his brother more for what kind of people they were on and off the ice.

""They are two guys who didn't have it easy,"" Schneider said. ""I've read the stories of them as teenagers and in their early 20s and how people questioned whether they could play and were tough enough. But here they are, 16 years later, one over 1,000 points and the other on the verge of getting there.

""I know they don't consider what kind of person you are when they look at your numbers, but Daniel and Henrik are two of the best people I've played with in this game and I think that's unanimous around the League.""

Daniel, taken by the Canucks with the No. 2 pick in the 1999 NHL Draft -- Henrik was No. 3 -- was appreciative when told of Schneider's comments.

""It means a lot,"" Daniel said. "" Because when you leave this game it's not so much what you do on the ice, but the impressions you left.""","the

DraftKings value picks for 7 pm contests

CENTER

Mathew Barzal, NYI ($5,300): The New York Islanders center remains a moderately priced DFS value target against the Ottawa Senators on Saturday (7 p.m. ET; CITY, MSG+, NHL.TV). Barzal extended his point streak to five games with a goal and an assist against the Philadelphia Flyers on Friday. The rookie forward has three goals, five assists, four power-play points and 11 shots on goal during his streak. In his past 10 games Barzal has 15 points (three goals, 12 assists) and is averaging 4.3 DraftKings points per game. His 22 points are tied for first among rookies with Brock Boeser of the Vancouver Canucks.

Spend up for: Steven Stamkos, TBL ($7,900 at PIT)

WING

Micheal Ferland, CGY ($4,500): The Calgary Flames right wing is in a great lineup situation and is a great price Saturday against the Colorado Avalanche (10 p.m. ET; CBC, ALT, NHL.TV). Ferland has settled in well on the first line with forwards Johnny Gaudreau ($7,800) and Sean Monahan ($6,900), scoring nine points (six goals, three assists) in his past nine games. He scored his ninth goal of the season against the Dallas Stars on Friday and is averaging 3.9 DraftKings points per game in nine games, over a full point more than his season average of 2.8 points per game.

Spend up for: Mark Stone, OTT ($6,400 vs NYI)

DEFENSE

Will Butcher, NJD ($4,000): The New Jersey Devils rookie defenseman is beginning to heat up again after cooling off from his solid start to the season and is a great value pick against the Detroit Red Wings (7 p.m. ET; FS-D, MSG+ 2, NHL.TV). Butcher has points in three of his past four games totaling two goals and two assists, one power-play assist, and has gotten very good category coverage with four blocked shots and five shots on goal. He is second to Barzal among rookies with 15 assists and his 17 points are fourth in rookie scoring. Butcher is averaging 2.6 DraftKings points per game in 22 games this season.

Spend up for: Nick Leddy, NYI ($5,600 at OTT)

GOALTENDER

Roberto Luongo, FLA ($7,300): The Florida Panthers goaltender will start against the Chicago Blackhawks at home on Saturday (7 p.m. ET; FS-F, NBCSCH, NHL.TV). Luongo has won four of his past five starts with one shutout and has allowed only eight goals against in that span. He is coming off a stellar performance against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday, stopping 43 of 44 shots in the Panthers 2-1 shootout victory. In five home games, Luongo is 3-0-a with a .932 save percentage.

Spend up for: Jake Allen, STL ($8,300 vs MIN)

10 a.m.

Khudobin solid again for Bruins

Boston Bruins goaltender Anton Khudobin had another strong game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday, stopping 17 shots in a 4-3 victory. It was the fourth consecutive start for Khudobin, and he has won all four of them. Bruins starter Tuukka Rask has been inconsistent, allowing Khudobin to carve out a larger starting role.

Khudobin (32 percent owned in Yahoo) has not lost a game in regulation with a 7-2-0 record in 10 games (nine starts). He has a 2.22 goals against average and .932 save percentage and is bordering on must-own in leagues, having started five of the Bruins past seven games. Fantasy owners should target him now, and should treat the Bruins goaltending situation as a time-share favoring Khudobin until he cools off.

Video: PIT@BOS: Khudobin comes up with clutch pad stop

Price to start for Canadiens

Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price will start against the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday (7 p.m. ET; TVA Sports, SN, MSG-B, NHL.TV). Price has missed the past 10 games because of a lower-body injury sustained on Nov. 2 against the Minnesota Wild.

The Canadiens assigned goaltender Charlie Lindgren to Laval of the American Hockey League to make room for Price's return.

Price was having a difficult season before the injury with three wins, a 3.77 goals against average and an .877 save percentage in 11 games (all starts). It is a far cry from last season when Price was the 38th overall player in Yahoo standard scoring leagues, but he still remains a must-own player in fantasy leagues.

The 30-year old faces the Sabres, who rank 30th in the NHL averaging 2.39 goals per game. He had 37 wins in 62 starts last season, tied for fifth in the league, and was one of only four goaltenders to rank in the top 10 in wins, save percentage and goals-against average. Braden Holtby (Washington Capitals), Sergei Bobrovsky (Columbus Blue Jackets) and Devan Dubnyk (Minnesota Wild) were the other three.

Low ownership trio have stellar game for Vegas

Forwards Jonathan Marchessault and William Karlsson, and defensemen Shea Theodore all came up huge for the Vegas Golden Knights in a 5-4 overtime victory against the San Jose Sharks on Friday that extended Vegas' winning streak to four games. Marchessault and Karlsson have been skating together as linemates for the majority of the season, and have been two of the teams most consistent forwards over the past two weeks.

Marchessault (36 percent owned in Yahoo) is dual-eligible (C/LW) and scored in overtime, his seventh goal of the season, and had two assists and three shots on goal. He has back-to-back multipoint games totaling two goals, four assists, two power-play points and 11 shots on goal. Marchessault is the 67th ranked player in Yahoo standard leagues.

Video: SJS@VGK: Marchessault nets wrister for game-winner

Karlsson (43 percent owned), who is also dual-eligible (C/LW) scored two goals, one on the power-play, on seven shots on goal to extend his point streak to four games. Karlsson has six goals, two assists and 17 shots on goal in that span. His 20 points (12 goals, eight assists) lead Vegas and he ranks in the top 100 (83) in Yahoo standard leagues.

Defensemen Shea Theodore (15 percent owned) has points in back-to-back games totaling one goal and two assists, with one power-play assist. He has been getting great category coverage as well with five shots on goal and nine blocked shots. Theodore, who has four points (one goal, three assists) in seven games, is skating on the second defense pair and is running the point on the first power-play unit. He will be bordering on must-own for fantasy owners if his recent play continues and will be a great value play in DFS contests.

Mike Zeisberger,"Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel aren't looking for sympathy. Only wins. Unfortunately for each of them, those have been few and far between this season.",2017-11-25T15:16:53Z,nhl-news,"McDavid, Eichel looking for wins, not sympathy",https://www.nhl.com/news/connor-mcdavid-jack-eichel-seeking-turnarounds/c-293349294,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293349632/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Unfortunately for each of them, those have been few and far between this season.

It was 29 months ago that McDavid was taken by the Edmonton Oilers with the No. 1 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft and Eichel was selected at No. 2 by the Buffalo Sabres. They were viewed as franchise players, the foundations that would pave the way to a successful future for each team. They each signed eight-year extensions with their respective teams this offseason, McDavid getting $100 million for an annual average value of $12.5 million and Eichel $80 million for an average annual value of $10 million.

But the start of the 2017-18 season has been tough for McDavid's Oilers and Eichel's Sabres, who have yet to reach the expectations lumped on them when training camps opened 10 weeks ago.

After the Sabres defeated the Oilers 3-1 at KeyBank Center on Friday, Edmonton and Buffalo had a combined record of 14-26-6, a losing mark McDavid and Eichel each find unacceptable.

Video: Okposo, Lehner lead Sabres past Oilers, 3-1

""I don't think you can feel sorry for yourself at all,"" said McDavid, 20, who won the Hart Trophy as League MVP with 100 points (30 goals, 70 assists) last season. ""We're the ones who got ourselves in this and we're the ones who's going to get ourselves out.

""We're learning about going through this. A lot of guys in this room, myself included, haven't gone the other way where we've expected to be good and we weren't very good. That's a new thing for a lot of guys. Like anyone else, it's not fun.

""It's not fun to come to the rink and lose.""

The Oilers have stumbled to an 8-13-2 start this season with a minus-17 goal differential.

After the Oilers came within one win of reaching the Western Conference Final last season, hopes in the organization and among the fans were high that the Oilers would rocket out of the gate, not stagger.

McDavid's right eyebrow shot up in quizzical fashion when asked to identify the glass-half-full aspects of the Oilers' season thus far.

""Positives?"" McDavid, the Oilers center, said incredulously. ""I mean, we haven't been very good this year. I think everyone's made that very clear.

""When I think positives? Whew. I don't know.""

Neither did Edmonton forward Patrick Maroon. Sitting a couple of locker stalls away from McDavid, he could only offer a sarcastic laugh upon hearing the question of what has gone right for the Oilers in a season of so many wrongs.

Eichel, whose Sabres finished 26th in the League last season but were expected to improve in 2017-18 under new coach Phil Housley, shares in McDavid's frustration and hasn't been shy to publicly show it.

The already simmering emotions of the Sabres center boiled over when a third-period goal by center Logan Couture gave the San Jose Sharks a 3-2 win against Buffalo on Oct. 28, spoiling Eichel's 21st birthday. Eichel reacted by snapping his stick over his knee in anger on his way to the dressing room after the final horn had sounded at KeyBank Center.

After a 5-4 loss to the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday, forward Jordan Nolan, who won two Stanley Cup championships with the Los Angeles Kings (2012, 2014), said the Sabres needed to be more accountable. With Buffalo (6-13-4) 30th in the NHL standings, Eichel agrees.

""I just think we should stop feeling sorry for ourselves, complaining or making excuses for what's going on,"" said Eichel, whose Sabres ended a seven-game losing streak with the victory against the Oilers.

""We just need to come together and work harder. I think that's always the key to success. When things aren't going right, start preparing better and working harder off the ice. Things usually translate.""

Video: EDM@BUF: Eichel wires wrister past Brossoit

Oilers coach Todd McLellan remembers the steamy evening of June 26, 2015 in Sunrise, Florida, when Edmonton picked McDavid No. 1 and Buffalo took Eichel with the No. 2 pick.

He also recalls the first time McDavid and Eichel played each other in an NHL game. On March 2, 2016, McDavid's overtime goal was the difference in a 2-1 Oilers win at the Sabres.

On that occasion, the game was billed as Connor versus Jack. On Friday, 632 days after that inaugural meeting, there was no such hype.

""When we look back at their draft year, the draft is an individual thing,"" McLellan said. ""It's purely where you're ranked, can you move ahead of an individual or will you fall. Teams, when they are drafting, are looking at lists that are purely based on one player. Once you pick that player, you're in a team environment. We have the luxury of having Connor here and he plays a tremendous team game. He's committed to the team. And he's done a real good job of leading.

""The first time [they played], there was a real contingent of [national] reporters and they made a lot of the Eichel-McDavid matchup. I think we're well beyond that now. This is Buffalo and Edmonton and both teams are looking for success.""

For Housley, heaping the hopes of an entire organization on the shoulders of one individual player is unrealistic and unfair, to say the least.

Whereas one star can carry a team in basketball, where five or six players can gobble up the majority of available minutes, the same is rarely true in hockey. Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby always had the on-ice support of fellow forward Evgeni Malkin, much in the fashion of the Chicago Blackhawks' Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews.

""It definitely has to be a collective effort,"" Housley said. ""I've never seen one player win a game for a hockey team. It's a team effort.

""I think when you look at it, Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel are tremendous players, top players in this league and that's why they're going to get a lot of attention. But they're only one piece of the puzzle. You have to play together as a team ...

""You look at the great teams, there's always great support around them.""","pittsburgh penguins

Jonathan Marchessault scored at 1:21 of overtime for Vegas, which has the fewest home defeats of any team in the NHL and hasn't lost at its rink since a 6-3 win by the Detroit Red Wings on Oct. 13.

The Vegas Golden Knights seem to really enjoy playing home games at T-Mobile Arena; completely understandable, considering they've won eight straight games there.

The eight-game home winning streak matched the NHL record for longest by a team in its inaugural season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The 1917-18 Toronto Arenas went 8-0-0 from Dec. 21, 1917-Feb. 11, 1918.

The Golden Knights also have won four in a row and are one victory away from equaling their longest winning streak this season. When they won five straight from Oct. 15-27, they tied an NHL mark, set by the 1926-27 New York Rangers and tied by the 1979-80 Edmonton Oilers for longest by an League team in its inaugural season, according to Elias.

Big night at The Rock

Hockey Fights Cancer Night took on extra significance for the New Jersey Devils since Brian Boyle's diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in September. With special guests in attendance, Boyle scored a big goal in a 3-2 win against the Vancouver Canucks on Friday.

The buy-low category can change on a week-to-week or even game-to-game basis depending on the league format or fantasy owner. Below are lists for each position, with two tiers for each. Order is based on NHL.com's most recent forward, defenseman and goalie rankings, which take into account past performance and future potential.

FORWARDS:

First tier: Brad Marchand, BOS (INJ.); Leon Draisaitl, EDM; Patrice Bergeron, BOS; Jack Eichel, BUF; Mike Hoffman, OTT; Artemi Panarin, CBJ; Mitchell Marner, TOR; Joe Pavelski, SJS; Wayne Simmonds, PHI; Max Pacioretty, MTL. Second tier: Jake Guentzel, PIT; Cam Atkinson, CBJ; Matt Duchene, OTT; Jonathan Drouin, MTL; Brandon Saad, CHI; Ryan O'Reilly, BUF; Jordan Eberle, NYI; Max Domi, ARI; Alex Galchenyuk, MTL.

@miketrip88: Time to drop Matt Duchene in all leagues?

I would not say all leagues just yet, but this has been a worst-case scenario so far for those who anxiously awaited the Duchene trade and anticipated a performance spike. He has no points, 24 shots on goal and is minus-10 in seven games with the Ottawa Senators, and they have yet to find the right forward combinations. I still have a lot of trust in defenseman Erik Karlsson and forwards Mark Stone and Mike Hoffman from a fantasy standpoint, so the chances of Duchene and the Senators figuring this thing out over time are strong. That said, it's concerning to see Duchene playing most often with Ryan Dzingel and Bobby Ryan as opposed to Stone and/or Hoffman. If there's a Brock Boeser, Teuvo Teravainen, Mathew Barzal, Mikael Granlund, Nino Niederreiter, Jake Guentzel, Jonathan Marchessault or another respectable forward available in a shallow or standard league, don't waste any more time. If the waiver wire is thin, you need to exercise patience for a few more weeks.

@gioiamia11: Points-only league. Who gets more by season's end: Dylan Larkin, Mikko Rantanen, Bo Horvat or Brock Boeser?

Boeser has the highest ceiling of this group considering he's better than a point per game (22 in 20 games) this season and showing no signs of letting up with a high shot volume and strong power-play production (10 power-play points). Horvat is on Boeser's line in most situations, meaning the center could easily jump to 60 points after scoring an NHL career-high 52 last season. Larkin is scoring primarily at even strength, and I worry about the Detroit Red Wings' sustainability. I love what's going on with the Colorado Avalanche and Rantanen's exposure to a resurgent Nathan MacKinnon, so I would probably go Boeser, Rantanen, Horvat and Larkin for a points-only format, in that order.

Video: VAN@PIT: Boeser rips one-timer past Murray for PPG

@joexbondo: I picked up Nino Niederrieter over Jake Guentzel this week for an open spot. It was a tough call. Should I make a switch now?

I love Guentzel's upside for the rest of the season despite a rocky start for the Pittsburgh Penguins. I've been a big advocate to buy low on him, his power-play usage and production have been better than expected, and his shooting percentage has begun to correct itself (four goals in past four games). He has also looked great at center with Evgeni Malkin out. But once Malkin returns, Guentzel needs to be in the top six and/or first power-play unit to remain fantasy relevant. On the flip side, the Minnesota Wild are finally getting healthy and Niederreiter looks even better than last season, when he finished as a top 15 left wing in Yahoo leagues. Try to make room for Guentzel elsewhere on your roster, maybe by dropping a defenseman or depth goaltender, because Niederreiter has bounced back from injury to score a power-play goal in five straight games on Minnesota's first unit. For those in hits leagues, Niederreiter and Guentzel each is a must-own option.

@KMerk99: Would you trade Ben Bishop to get Cam Talbot in a buy-low opportunity (W, GAA, SV% league)?

This is much more of a lateral move than it would have been in the preseason, but I would hold off on this trade. I love Talbot's buy-low appeal, especially if Edmonton's low 5-on-5 shooting percentage (6.6, 28th in NHL) reverts closer to normal, but Bishop has been dominant at home, and I don't see that changing. If anything, his road splits come back to earth. Dallas, like Edmonton, is trying to spread out its scoring, but the Stars have the clear advantage on defense when comparing John Klingberg to Klefbom. I know things can change over time, but I trust Dallas a lot more than Edmonton the rest of the way. The Stars rank near the top of the League in power-play percentage (23.9 percent, 5th) and, like the Oilers, have room for improvement in goals per game (2.91, T-14th).

@SteveLovesHocke: What are your thoughts on Carey Price for the remainder of the season? Think he can turn it around, or is the team in front of him just not good enough this season? I'm thinking of trading John Gibson and Wayne Simmonds to get him. Thanks.

We saw a glimpse of the Montreal Canadiens' bounce-back potential when Charlie Lindgren went 3-1-0 early during Price's injury absence. That said, I am sticking with my gut from the preseason that I would not invest heavily in this roster. Giving up Simmonds, a valuable category coverage for the up-and-down Philadelphia Flyers, plus Gibson for Price is too much. Gibson is 16th among starting goaltenders in Yahoo's performance-based rankings despite injuries to Ryan Getzlaf, Ryan Kesler and a bunch of the Anaheim Ducks defensemen. I would side with him, especially knowing those talented players will be back over the course of the season. For those who already own Price, activate him now ahead of his return against the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday (7 p.m. ET; TVAS, SN, MSG-B, NHL.TV).

@GrimlockSlag: Standard league. Please rank Mathew Barzal, Evgenii Dadonov, Jonathan Marchessault and Gabriel Landeskog. Thanks.

Here's an early update to my top 100 forward rankings for next week: 1. Barzal, 2. Landeskog, 3. Marchessault, 4. Dadonov.

Video: NYI@PHI: Barzal uses leg to score late in the 1st

@gioiamia11: What is Clayton Keller's ceiling in points this season? After only playing approximately 30 games last season with Boston University, will he run out of gas playing an 82-game schedule?

I believe the Arizona Coyotes were at least slightly better than their record to start the season. Hopefully this Antti Raanta injury isn't serious, because the goaltender was beginning to bounce back and the Coyotes don't have much depth behind him. We've also seen improved play from Ekman-Larsson in recent games, a great sign for Keller's rest-of-season upside. Keller has gone nine games without a goal and could have some more growing pains as his rookie season unfolds, but I would still say there's a great chance he reaches 60 points. The upcoming Christmas and All-Star breaks should help the Coyotes, who have had a difficult schedule so far.

@MiazyK: I traded Brayden Schenn for John Tavares. Who do you like more rest of season? 15 forward categories. Thanks Pete!

Each of these players is averaging better than a point per game, and neither is a particularly strong face-off man. You must not be too reliant on hits if you traded Schenn away, and you clearly acquired the more proven fantasy asset in Tavares, who's in a contract year and continues to make the most of Anders Lee and Josh Bailey. St. Louis Blues forwards Paul Stastny and Jaden Schwartz have injury histories, and Schenn could be moved off Vladimir Tarasenko's line if either goes down for any period of time. This is a really close one, but my latest forward rankings reflect my opinion: 15. John Tavares, C, NYI; 16. Brayden Schenn, C/LW, STL.","brock boeser teuvo teravainen mathew barzal mikael granlund nino niederreiter jake guentzel jonathan marchessault

Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price, who has missed the past 10 games with a lower-body injury, will start against the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday (7 p.m. ET; SN, TVA Sports, MSG-B, NHL.TV).

""Maybe a week,"" he said after practice Friday. ""I didn't expect it to be quite this long. I had to make sure because I didn't want to get hurt and be out for a longer period.

""I had a pretty good idea I was going to feel good today; it was just making sure that going through a full practice, I'd feel good and feel like my game is where it should be at to be in there. The last couple of skates weren't exactly full practices for me. Pregame skates, and I didn't want to take the other guys shots before the game, so being able to take a full practice today was a big difference.""

Price is 3-7-1 with a 3.77 goals-against average and an .877 save percentage this season. The Canadiens (8-12-3) have lost five straight and were 4-4-2 in his absence. Entering play Friday, they were in sixth place in the Atlantic Division, four points behind the third place Detroit Red Wings.

""It's a big cluster in the middle (of the standings),"" Price said. ""Anything can happen. There is a lot of hockey left to be played. Just have to take it step by step. You want to be able to come back and make a difference. The season is not over yet.""

Price played Nov. 2 game at the Minnesota Wild despite sustaining the injury late in warmups before the 6-3 loss.

""I was good enough to go. It probably wasn't the greatest idea,"" he said. ""... We went over quite a bit of tape to try and prepare yourself mentally to come back. A lot of it was rehab exercises and just getting your body prepared for the battle again.""

The injury was unrelated to a knee injury Price sustained on Nov. 25, 2015, which caused him to miss the remainder of the 2015-16 season.

""It's just about getting timing back and getting into a groove again,"" Price said. ""Definitely taking a step back in watching again, it helps sometimes, but definitely was eager to get back this whole time. ""

Charlie Lindgren made eight straight starts for Montreal before Antti Niemi started a 3-2 shootout loss to the Nashville Predators on Wednesday. Lindgren was returned to Laval of the American Hockey League on Friday. Backup Al Montoya has been out since Nov. 4 because of a concussion.

""It's pretty obvious that with the uncertainty around Montoya's situation, we could lose Niemi if we put him on waivers,"" Montreal coach Claude Julien said. ""By keeping him here, we can send Charlie back to Laval, which is 20 minutes from here and have him keep playing, We can recall him anytime.

""We want to manage our goalie situation well so that we don't get caught off guard if we lose Niemi and another goalie gets hurt. That would bring us back to the situation we were in not too long ago.""","montreal canadiens

Boyle's family, wife Lauren, son Declan and daughter Isabella, were in attendance for the ceremonial puck drop where 13-year-old Jennifer, a patient from the Children's Hospital of New Jersey at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, did the honors. Boyle, of course, took the faceoff.

The Devils had three youth patients join the team on the ice for the ceremony and employed eight-year-old Abdiel Collazo as honorary the Coach of the Day.

CAITLIN EMMA,"A furious Sen. Lamar Alexander saw the Education Department going off track in its enforcement of a law he helped write, and he didn’t hesitate to intervene.",2017-11-25T07:11:45Z,politico,How a powerful senator schooled Betsy DeVos,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/25/lamar-alexander-betsy-devos-259443,https://static.politico.com/17/da/410b468f4158b0e2ffb5fc64e9cb/171121-betsy-devos-ap-1160.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Several months ago, Sen. Lamar Alexander phoned Education Secretary Betsy DeVos with a message: Back off.

Alexander, the Republican chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, was furious that a top DeVos aide was circumventing a new law aimed at reducing the federal government’s role in K-12 education. He contended that the agency was out of bounds by challenging state officials, for instance, about whether they were setting sufficiently ambitious goals for their students.

Story Continued Below

DeVos’ agency quickly yielded to his interpretation of the law — and she “thanked me for it,” Alexander told POLITICO.

Alexander’s heavy hand raises questions about who’s calling some of the shots at the Education Department, an agency he once headed — and to which DeVos came with virtually no expertise in running government bureaucracies.

DeVos has been a lightning rod in the education world and one of the most controversial members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet. She made her name as a school choice activist and billionaire Republican donor before she was nominated to run the Education Department. With Alexander running the key Senate oversight committee, observers say he’s trying to keep her agency on a tight leash.

But some see Alexander’s moves earlier this summer as presumptuous — and believe they not only abruptly changed how the agency is enforcing the law, called the Every Student Succeeds Act, but could translate into little to no federal oversight of state education. Critics note the law imposed certain requirements to protect poor and minority students, whose performance often lags behind their peers'. They worry whether states will adequately track and provide equal opportunities for at-risk kids or face consequences from the Education Department if they fail to do that.

Since Alexander got in the middle, the agency is not as “aggressive or thorough” in its oversight of state education issues, said Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott, the top Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee.

Scott added that he “can’t remember another example of when a lower-level official” was called out in such a way. The Trump appointee whom Alexander blasted, Jason Botel, is viewed with suspicion by some administration officials because he donated to Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.

“Usually, if you’re going to have a disagreement with the Education Department, then you’re going to have a disagreement with the Cabinet secretary,” Scott said.

Former Republican Rep. John Kline, also an architect of the measure, has said he’s worried states are now getting away with testing plans that violate a key requirement of the law — that states administer the same test to all students annually. The provision is critical so that states are forced to report the performance of all students and the results for poor and minority students are not hidden from view, as they were for decades before federal testing requirements were enacted.

But Kline, of Minnesota, said he thinks Alexander’s “doing what he’s supposed to do” as Senate education chairman.

Alexander, a former Tennessee governor and GOP presidential candidate, as well as former secretary of Education, told POLITICO that his intent is to make sure states are in the driver’s seat when it comes to the law that he helped write.

The Every Student Succeeds Act, which passed in 2015, was widely viewed as a corrective to the federal overreach that followed the George W. Bush-era law that it replaced, known as No Child Left Behind.

DeVos’ aide Botel “obviously hadn’t read the law,” Alexander said, referring to the Every Student Succeeds Act, “so I called the secretary and told her that.”

Others disagree with Alexander’s interpretation of the law. “Lamar Alexander has been in this business a long time and he has a good reputation,” said Charles Barone, policy director for the advocacy group Democrats for Education Reform.

“But on this one, it seems he’s breaking the deal,” Barone said, suggesting that some of Alexander’s assertions about the law don’t jibe with Democrats’ understanding.

“We’re going to go back to a world of confusion, so each school district can make itself look as good as it wants to look,” he added, referring to an era before No Child Left Behind when state data on how students were performing masked critical problems.

Just two weeks after the call between Alexander and DeVos, on July 27, the Education Department confirmed to reporters that the agency was changing how it reviews state plans, possibly shielding the biggest federal concerns from public view by first conveying them in telephone calls with state officials rather than on paper.

The review and questioning of states also became less intense through the summer, after Alexander got involved.

Speculation swirled that Botel was leaving the agency or switching jobs. His public critiques of state plans, once lengthy and probing, now mostly ask for missing information or clarifications. Botel did not respond to requests from POLITICO for comment.

States are now finalizing plans required by the law about how they’ll hold schools accountable for whether students are learning and making progress, though there are plenty of signs the Trump administration won’t exercise much oversight.

During her confirmation hearing in January, Democrats demanded to know whether DeVos would ever reject a state’s plan if she found it insufficient. She would not say, only vowing to follow the letter of the law. ""I might not agree with every approach that every state takes, but I’m not going to invent new regulations,"" DeVos said. ""The important thing is, are they following the law or not?""

Alexander went further, telling a group of state and school board leaders in January they should ""assume the U.S. Department of Education will say yes"" to the plans they're drafting.

And he was furious when that did not seem to be happening after DeVos put Botel in charge of reviewing those plans in April. Botel, an advocate for racial and social justice who founded a Baltimore charter school chain, didn’t require Senate confirmation because he was an acting assistant secretary.

For example, the Every Student Succeeds Act requires states to set “ambitious” long-term goals for students, without defining what “ambitious” means. Alexander fought for a provision that explicitly bars the Education secretary from saying what those goals should be.

But Botel told Delaware education officials in June to revamp their goals because they weren’t rigorous enough, without specifying what the goals should be. He told The New York Times in a July 7 article that it’s the secretary’s “responsibility” to determine whether state goals are ambitious.

Alarm bells went off among Senate Republicans. The Times interview “was symbolic of everything we were trying to stop,” a senior GOP aide told POLITICO.

Alexander privately met with Botel at the Education Department shortly afterward. The meeting didn’t go well, according to Alexander.

“I didn’t want … states … to look at Washington and say, ‘Uh oh, nothing’s changed,'"" Alexander said. “We don’t have the flexibility that [Congress] talked about. Everything we try to do, the [Education Department] is going to restrict.”

Alexander said he talked to Botel “about that and he didn’t seem to understand it very well.” So he called DeVos.

Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill wouldn’t describe Alexander’s phone call with DeVos or when it occurred. But DeVos had a 15-minute call scheduled with Alexander in the afternoon of July 12, according to her calendar, which was obtained by POLITICO through a Freedom of Information Act request.

“As the Secretary has said repeatedly, her job is to ensure that ESSA state plans comply with the law Congress passed,” Hill said in a statement. “Any state plan that meets the law’s requirements will get approved. Where there is discretion in the law, she and Senator Alexander agree that the Department should defer to the states.”

When asked if he had requested in the phone call that DeVos go so far as to remove Botel, Alexander said: “No, I don’t think I did. I just didn’t like the decisions that he was making and I didn’t try to tell her who she should have in any particular job.”

“That’s her decision until the president nominates somebody.”

Alexander said he feels like his intervention helped the Education Department “from going off track.”

The senior GOP aide said the Education Department “stopped giving bad advice to states” and stopped questioning matters that belong to state school officials, such as setting goals for students and education systems.

“Our concerns about Jason have diminished a lot,” the aide said. “He seems to have gotten the message.”

Besides GOP members of Congress, Botel also earned criticism from education policy wonks for giving inconsistent feedback to states, even as many Democrats were heartened he was asking probing questions.

Scott said Botel’s initial questioning of state education goals “showed the department was serious [about school accountability] — that if you had elements that were inconsistent with the law, you’d get called on it.”

“If goals are factually not ambitious, I don’t see how the secretary can ignore that,” Scott said.

Botel remains at the Education Department. But Peter Oppenheim, a former aide to Alexander who helped write ESSA, is now involved in the agency’s work on the law, though his role remains unclear. The Senate confirmed Oppenheim in August to serve as the Education Department’s liaison to Congress.

“Peter has been a tremendous asset,” the senior GOP aide said. “He knows what’s allowed and what’s not allowed.”

But Democrats like Scott and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking member of Alexander’s committee, say states are getting approved even when their plans violate the law.

Alexander said that kind of criticism “primarily comes from people who are accustomed to telling states what to do. And that’s not what this law allows.""

From the outset of the Trump administration, he said he was determined to find an Education secretary who would embrace that — telling prospective candidates for the job how the law curbed the secretary’s authority to dictate K-12 school policy.

DeVos “easily agreed with that,” Alexander said. “She agrees, like I do, that the secretary’s office is … a bully pulpit, and not a place to issue mandates to 14,000 school districts about how to run the day-to-day operations of their schools.”

Alexander also led a push earlier this year to scrap an Obama rule aimed at guiding states as they designed their systems for holding schools accountable for student achievement — despite protests from state education leaders, the business community and some Republicans like Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio.

“There appeared to be bipartisan — at least acceptance — of the regulation,” Scott said. But the rule was killed on a party-line vote in the Senate and signed into law by Trump.

The Obama regulation didn’t follow the law, Alexander insisted, and it wasn’t necessary because the “law is pretty carefully written.”

Asked what he would do if Education nominees were sent to the Senate who disagreed with his vision for state control, Alexander said he doubted that would happen.

“I would expect President Trump to appoint people who were in favor of local control of schools,” he said. “I don’t think I have to lecture the White House about that. I think that’s what the president said what he believes. So I don’t have much worry about that, but I’m going to watch it carefully.”","the

MAURA REYNOLDS,Top economic thinkers from the U.S. and Europe say we need to start by fixing our politics.,2017-11-16T05:07:28Z,politico,How to future-proof the West's economies,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/16/future-of-western-economies-transatlantic-solutions-244934,https://static.politico.com/12/08/c605ef924198aadb61475d407247/cabinet-economy-lede-final-rev.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Sure, growth could be more robust. Sure, some workers are getting left behind. Sure, corporate debt is high and markets look frothy. But those problems aren’t the biggest threat facing the economies of the United States and Europe.

What is? The answer from a group of top economic thinkers convened by POLITICO isn’t something in the economy. It’s politics.

Story Continued Below

At a time that technology is transforming society, the postwar order is being challenged and Asia is on the rise, we convened some of the smartest economic minds from both sides of the Atlantic in a working group at POLITICO headquarters. Our goal was to identify the factors that would make or break Western economies in the decades to come.

So we were surprised that a conversation which ranged from robots to transfer pricing kept returning to one central theme: Political systems on both continents have become so dysfunctional that they threaten the West’s economic future.

That’s not to say the economic risks aren’t real. Our participants, many of them economists, cooked up a witches’ brew of worries, from a dangerous overhang of corporate debt to wage stagnation to the stubborn underemployment of 20-something men. But they considered those problems solvable — at least, if political systems were operating normally.

“The economy itself is doing quite well,’’ said one participant. “It’s the political risk underlying our system which is the greatest risk to the economy going forward.”

“Are there policy prescriptions for all this? Absolutely,’’ said another participant. “As an economist, you can sit there and say, ‘Look, there’s a solution.’ It’s just politically, they’re all very hard to do.”

The conversation was the second in a trans-Atlantic journalism project called The POLITICO Cabinet, organized jointly by POLITICO newsrooms in the U.S. and Europe. It was conducted under Chatham House rules: Names of the participants are public, but specific quotes are not attributed to individual participants. (For a list of participants, click here.)

Our participants described a vicious cycle underway between Western economics and politics: Economic dislocations and limited upward social mobility are eroding communities and fueling resurgent nationalism. That in turn fragments political parties and promotes a dysfunctional political discourse that retards constructive economic remedies.

“In a time where the economic forces are requiring a lot of political reaction, we are not able to react,” one participant said.

“I have been surprised and disappointed that neither party in the U.S. has done any kind of credible job of looking at these issues of preparing a workforce with the skills they need to succeed, helping individuals and communities that are adversely affected by change,” said another participant. “You would have thought, coming out of this election, Republicans would join Democrats in saying, ‘Here’s our base that we need to do something for.’ And there’s been almost no serious discussion of what to do.”

Working group members debated the rise of what they called “economic nationalism” — the idea that governments will reject globalism and multinational institutions in the name of promoting domestic industries and political constituencies. It’s the idea motivating Donald Trump’s “America First” rhetoric as well as China’s new push to dominate some parts of the global economy.

Political fragmentation, participants warned, means that economic nationalism could give authoritarian capitalist systems like China an advantage over the West, since they are more politically cohesive.

Participants disagreed, however, over whether China would be setting the rules of the road for the global economic system in the future. Some called that likely as China’s economy grows, saying its leaders might aspire to global dominance. Others thought China was likely to continue to chart a somewhat independent course, content to share leadership with the U.S. and Europe.

“I don’t think you’re going to see China step up and say, ‘OK, I’m now the biggest economy in the world, the old world is passe and I’m going to go to the [World Trade Organization] and write a new set of rules for the world’,” one participant said. “I think they’re just going to do their own thing … The tendency could also be that we have regional groupings driven by ideas of economic nationalism being relatively antagonistic with each other and the world.”

But a clear consensus around the table held that globalizing forces will likely prevail, in part because the growth-driving technology and financial sectors are fundamentally global in nature.

“The economics, if nothing else, will drive us back towards more global institutions and global organizations,” one participant said.

WHAT WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT

Here are other key takeaways from the conversation:

Companies have taken on too much debt, and if we’re not careful, that could trigger another financial crisis.

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when interest rates were kept very low, companies around the world found it easy to raise money by issuing bonds and other forms of corporate debt. Now, as interest rates creep up, there are warning signs that some companies are having trouble servicing their debt. If companies begin to default on their debt and debtholders (including large investors like banks) can’t easily sell off their holdings, that could trigger a 2008-style financial crisis.

Participants didn’t say that scenario was likely, just that the underlying conditions are there. But they urged preparation for it, since a series of defaults would require bailouts that would dampen economic growth for years. (That’s assuming political leaders have the ability to address the crisis in the first place.)

Stock markets are too optimistic, and are not pricing in real political risks, so they are extra-vulnerable to political instability.

Bull markets at a moment of political instability can appear too good to be true. And indeed, the working group economists agreed that the markets are effectively ignoring real risks.

One participant quoted a credit agency officer who acknowledged being fatalistic about global risk: “Either the risk happens, or it doesn’t and there’s no point in pricing it until it’s so close to happening that you can see the whites of the eyes.”

The result, the participant said, is that a political crisis, such as a conflict with North Korea, could trigger a stock market crash and a larger global financial crisis.

“You have asset valuations that are just really out of line with fundamentals and with actual risks,’’ the participant said.

Economic inequality is a real problem.

Middle-class malaise threatens the social fabric in both the U.S. and Europe, despite the fact that economies in both the U.S. and Europe are growing. Because of wage stagnation and dimming career prospects, more workers are bailing out of the workforce.

""I think that’s the issue,"" said one participant. ""It’s inequality. Lots of people aren’t feeling this recovery, because we haven’t had any wage growth in the U.S. or in Europe.""

This trend is likely to only worsen in coming decades, as automation reduces the need for many middle-tier jobs.

“Automation really carves out the middle chunk of jobs, and that exacerbates inequality,” said another participant.

Social mobility is also a real problem.

On both continents, there’s a palpable sense among workers that they won’t do as well as their parents, and their children won’t do as well as they have. This is fueling a toxic political environment that has fragmented political parties, making it harder for them to respond coherently to economic threats.

In the U.S., the lack of social mobility appears mostly connected to wage stagnation and the decline of manufacturing. In Europe, by contrast, participants said the roots of the trend are more cultural — driven by fears that immigrants will transform European societies for the worse.

Trade deficits are NOT a real problem.

Although the participants came from across the political spectrum, they agreed that trade deficits are not a cause for concern, since deficits tend to worsen when the economy is strong and consumers are buying a lot of goods, and that the ebbs and flows tend to balance out over time and between countries. One participant called the trade deficit “a ridiculous metric.”

“We had a wonderful, wonderful trade surplus during the Great Depression, and we had a yawning trade deficit in the 1990s, when we added 22 million jobs,” the participant said.

Globalization will win in the end … whether some people like it or not.

Technology and global supply chains mean that our economies will be integrated and interdependent going forward, even if politically we remain at odds.

“I think all the supernationalism is going to burn itself out in part, because it’s going to be economically unsustainable,’’ said one participant.

“I don’t think globalization is going to go away,’’ said another participant. But the world “is going to be fragmented and there’s going to still be dysfunction in government.”

WHAT CAN WE DO?

Is there a way to future-proof the economies of the West? Here are some measures the working group said Western policymakers should consider right now:

1. Tackle inequality

Growth has dominated the economic calculus for decades. But deepening inequality has become a threat to continued growth and prosperity.

Participants expressed skepticism about predictions that 40 percent of the U.S. workforce and 30 percent of the European workforce could lose their jobs to robots in the next two decades. But they conceded that automation will displace enough workers to exacerbate inequality. That means Western governments and economists need to be thinking about policy responses to those job losses now. And they need to think about how to share prosperity across geographic regions and generations.

One participant noted that it would be helpful if economists and policymakers stopped looking just at gross domestic product as the measure of an economy’s health.

“Who cares about growth?” the participant asked. “I understand why investors do, but is that the be-all and end-all? Should that be the gold standard for economists? No, inclusive growth is probably a more important measure. Measures of inequality, that’s what we should be looking at.”

Some participants expressed support for the idea of a “universal basic income,” a basic Social Security-style income payment to all citizens in a country that would provide a subsistence level of income, including to the unemployed.

“It’s politically toxic, so it’s going to take a crisis for any politician to go there,” said one participant. “But I just don’t see much of an alternative.”

Others expressed doubt that basic income payments would work, since as one participant put it, “It’s not going to be a satisfying way for people to live.”

2. Engage with China

Some participants expressed dismay over China’s resistance to many international norms of doing business. But they agreed that engaging Chinese leaders is crucial to navigating a world in which China becomes evermore economically and politically dominant, even if it hasn’t shown much benefit yet.

“We always knew that China was different, but the thought was, if we bring them in through the [WTO] or its other mechanism, they’ll become more like us,” one participant said. “The reality is they are not becoming more like us, really.”

3. Get serious about training and education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)

The working group agreed that the jobs of the future will need more workers with higher technical skills and that governments need to partner with the private sector to figure out how to train those workers – the sooner the better.

“We’ve been talking about the lack of a trained workforce for STEM for 10 years now,’’ said one participant. “How come we still have a lack of trained workforce?”

The participants noted that some European countries, particularly Germany, are outpacing the U.S. in promoting education in science and technology.

SEIZE THESE OPPORTUNITIES

Participants were able to point to some positive trends that might mitigate their otherwise a fairly gloomy outlook for the economies of the U.S. and Europe.

One participant noted that the surprising election of President Donald Trump and the unexpected vote of United Kingdom citizens to leave the European Union have spurred a backlash which might undermine the trend toward nationalism and improve prospects for globalism.

“Trump has been a major wakeup call in the United States and around the world, and may well have elicited a bit of a counter reaction,’’ the participant said.

“I’m actually quite optimistic that in some ways, a reaction to Trump will be a furtherance of globalization as other countries see what’s at risk is you go down this path of populism and you go down the path of isolation,” this person added.

Another participant predicted that the millennial generation on both continents will push governments and businesses to change for the better: “If you think about millennials, the generation to come, they are the most high-maintenance consumers that this world has ever seen. And there’s a lot of dysfunction that they will not tolerate.”

And finally, several participants expressed optimism that the dysfunction of political systems at the national level might spur more political engagement at the community level — leading to more cooperation and economic prosperity on a local scale.

“I think if you look at a truly local level, you will probably start to see [movement toward creative political solutions] because of frankly, the pushback against this past election,’’ one participant said. “I do think there are people out there, and it is the next generation, who are thinking differently about what the solutions need to be.”","ideas of economic nationalism

KEVIN ROBILLARD,2017-11-22 Pro-Campaigns-McConnellLitmus (188968),2017-11-25T07:09:13Z,politico,Republicans flee from McConnell in 2018 primaries,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/25/republicans-flee-from-mcconnell-in-2018-primaries-259615,https://static.politico.com/bb/cc/fa2e96584839b0ee22166e199050/171121-msmmcconnell-1-1160.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Nobody wants to be on Team McConnell.

Heading into the 2018 elections, only one Republican Senate candidate nationwide has pledged unequivocally to back Mitch McConnell as majority leader. Most Republicans facing competitive primaries are hemming and hawing, admiring McConnell’s political savvy and fundraising apparatus — but also looking warily at his sinking approval ratings both with Republicans and the broader electorate.

Story Continued Below

Even in some of the red and purple states represented by Democratic senators where McConnell is hoping to pad his majority — places like Missouri, Michigan and Wisconsin — the leading candidates are dodging questions about McConnell's leadership or threatening to oppose him if the GOP Congress doesn't deliver on the party's legislative priorities in the coming months.

A few Senate candidates are outright spurning him, aligning themselves with former White House strategist Steve Bannon. Both Democrats and Republicans think President Donald Trump has simultaneously elevated McConnell in importance and blamed him for the slow pace of Republican legislating, including the failure to repeal Obamacare. The result is a GOP Senate leader few candidates want to publicly align with, even if they're likely to support him if they arrive in Washington.

Corey Stewart, the Trump-aligned local elected official in Virginia who narrowly lost this year's GOP primary for governor and is now challenging Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, said he encountered little backing for McConnell while traveling the state.

“The guy’s toxic,” said Stewart, who has courted Bannon’s support. “There’s no support for him, even among the establishment. He hasn’t been able to pass the president’s agenda.”

Most other GOP Senate candidates are more circumspect, acknowledging voters' frustrations with Washington while cautious not to antagonize McConnell and his well-funded political operation.

“If he can get health care, immigration, tax reform done, terrific,” Michigan businessman Sandy Pensler told the Detroit News when he launched his campaign earlier this week. “Otherwise ... he shouldn’t be the leader. It’s a results-driven analysis for me. So far he hasn’t gotten it done.”

McConnell’s political allies insist they’ve seen all this before, and they are ready to fight it. Past insurgent Republican campaigns have run television ads bashing McConnell, only to lose in GOP primaries anyway. Candidates distancing themselves from party leaders in Washington, they argue, is now standard practice and smart politics.

Bannon and his allies instead see evidence of McConnell’s ineffectiveness and unpopularity.

“Why are Republicans candidates tweeting out selfies with Steve Bannon, while at the same time doing everything they can to publicly distance themselves from McConnell?” Andy Surabian, a top aide to Bannon, asked rhetorically. “Because they know that McConnell is an albatross, not only in GOP primaries, but more importantly in general elections.”

Former McConnell chief of staff Josh Holmes dismissed conversations about the leader’s future as a “fun Beltway-journalist story written every single election cycle” and noted McConnell has won six leadership elections unanimously.

“For as long as Mitch McConnell has been Republican leader, our candidates have been counseled not to get bogged down in Washington leadership questions,” Holmes said. “The simple reality is that if a candidate is throwing endorsements around presuming their own election, they're doing it wrong. I'm not aware of a single senator of either party who was elected for supporting leadership, and I know there hasn't been a candidate elected by opposing Mitch McConnell.”

McConnell himself has given candidates permission to do what they need to do to win. “I'm not going to be on the ballot in any of these states, and I don't think that the candidates who are running need to take a position on me,” McConnell said on ""Fox and Friends"" last month.

Most GOP candidates haven’t outright declared opposition to McConnell, save Stewart, former Arizona state Sen. Kelli Ward and perennial Nevada candidate Danny Tarkanian, who both started their races challenging GOP incumbents. (Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake announced last month he won't seek a second term in the chamber, saying, ""I could not win in a Republican primary"" because of his criticisms of Trump.)

Instead, most GOP Senate candidates are on the defensive, or framing their support for McConnell as conditional. Last month, Wisconsin state Sen. Leah Vukmir told a local radio show, ""Mitch McConnell isn’t getting the job done. He does need to go.”

But the next day, on a different radio show, she had a slightly softer take. “I guess I’m not focused on hypothetical leadership races a year from now,"" she said. ""[Y]ou know, if Mitch isn’t getting the job done, he needs to go. But at the same time, look at who he is dealing with. We need to get extra, conservative, reliable, Republican voters in there.”

Vukmir's opponent, businessman and veteran Kevin Nicholson, originally said he would support McConnell but has since won Bannon's endorsement and now supports ""new leadership"" for Senate Republicans. Wisconsin GOP operatives are now speculating whether McConnell's allies may spend on Vukmir's behalf before the August 2018 primary.

Other candidates, even if they aren’t outright calling for McConnell’s ouster, aren’t heaping praise on the chamber they seek to join. Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, aiming to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker, called the Senate “dysfunctional” and “enough to drive you nuts.”

Missouri state Attorney General Josh Hawley, widely considered the GOP’s top Senate recruit so far and someone who’s been claimed by both establishment operatives and Bannon-aligned Republicans, has also ducked questions on whether he’ll support McConnell. A spokesman told the Kansas City Star last month that Hawley ""is not willing to tolerate the failure of the D.C. establishment any longer"" but declined to address McConnell specifically.

The special Senate election in Alabama may have been the first test of McConnell's position in a GOP primary. Interim Sen. Luther Strange — backed by Trump and McConnell — was defeated by former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, whose sexual molestation scandal has threatened a GOP-held seat.

Senate Leadership Fund — the big-spending super PAC controlled by McConnell's allies — cited Trump’s criticism of the Republican Congress, not McConnell's own political standing, as a reason establishment candidates would struggle in 2018.

“The Republican Congress has replaced President Obama as the bogeyman for conservative GOP primary voter,” wrote Steven Law, the group’s president, adding: “This narrative is driven by Trump himself, and it resonates with primary voters who believe the Republican Congress ‘isn’t doing enough’ (as we frequently heard in focus groups) to advance the president’s agenda.”

In the past, Senate Leadership Fund has backed leadership-aligned Republicans in primaries. In 2016, the PAC helped lift now-Sen. Todd Young to a GOP primary victory over Rep. Marlin Stutzman, who ran ads attacking Young as a McConnell puppet. In total, the group spent $86 million in independent expenditures in the 2016 cycle.

The only candidate explicitly backing McConnell this cycle is West Virginia Rep. Evan Jenkins, who is locked in a primary battle with the state's attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. But despite the support for McConnell, Jenkins, a two-term congressman, is casting Morrisey as the creature of Washington; Morrisey's wife, Denise Henry Morrisey, is a Washington lobbyist.

McConnell’s approval ratings have tanked over the past year. Democratic and Republican polls have found McConnell deeply unpopular with GOP primary electorates. A September survey from the pro-Democratic Senate Majority PAC showed McConnell with just a 17 percent approval rating among likely Arizona GOP primary voters in 2018, and a private GOP exit poll in Alabama found just 25 percent of Alabama primary runoff voters said McConnell’s support for Strange made it more likely for them to vote for him, while 55 percent said it made them less likely.

The general election picture is more muddled. The latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found just 23 percent of registered voters had a favorable opinion of McConnell, compared to 41 percent with an unfavorable opinion, which matches other public polls. Those numbers are worse than those for Pelosi, House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

But Democrats are unsure if they can turn him into a powerful enough symbol of a dysfunctional Washington to turn off swing voters. Strategists in both parties note it took years and tens of millions of dollars in television ads for Republicans to turn Pelosi into an effective boogeyman.

“There are several states and districts that voted for Trump where the president's numbers remain about even, but Republicans in Congress are far less popular than Democrats in Congress,” said Matt Canter, a pollster at Global Strategy Group, a Democratic firm. “Leveraging McConnell and Ryan in these areas could be very effective.”","state supreme court justice

The White House on Saturday said President Donald Trump has the authority to put budget director Mick Mulvaney at the helm of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, setting the stage for what could be a protracted legal battle.

A senior administration official said the decision to appoint Mulvaney was informed by communication with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which will issue a formal opinion soon. Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, will start his second job at the CFPB Monday morning, replacing Richard Cordray, who resigned Friday.

Yet Mulvaney's appointment came just hours after Cordray abruptly resigned and named the agency’s chief of staff, Leandra English, as deputy director, establishing her as his successor as he steps down.

The competing moves plunged the agency into confusion over the leadership of the bureau, which was established in the wake of the financial crisis and has become a target for relentless attacks by Republicans and business executives for its aggressive enforcement.

The legal counsel's opinion is still being drafted, the official said. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mulvaney ""will go into the office Monday and start working,"" another senior administration official said.

Trump later Saturday tweeted: ""The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!""

He followed up quickly with another tweet: ""Check out the recent Editorial in the Wall Street Journal @WSJ about what a complete disaster the @CFPB has been under its leader from previous Administration, who just quit!""

Trump and Cordray, long at odds over the direction and future of the agency, are headed for a showdown in court that could take months or more to unravel.

On Trump's side is the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which allows the president to designate a Senate-confirmed official to perform the functions of a vacant position until a nominee can be confirmed to the office.

In Cordray's corner is the Dodd-Frank Act, the landmark 2010 law that created the CFPB and sets up its own line of succession, stating that the bureau's deputy shall serve as acting director in the ""absence or unavailability of the Director.""

Cordray pitched the bureau into that legal chasm just after 2 p.m. Friday, when he elevated English to deputy director. Minutes later, Cordray said he would resign at the end of the day. On Nov. 15, he had said he would step down at the end of the month.

""Appointing the current chief of staff to the deputy director position would minimize operational disruption and provide for a smooth transition given her operational expertise,"" Cordray wrote in his resignation letter to staff.

Just after 7:30 p.m. Friday, the White House designated Mulvaney as acting director of the watchdog agency until a permanent leader can be nominated and confirmed.

""Cordray is saying, and the consumer advocates are saying, that a resignation by Cordray constitutes absence or unvailability, whereas the White House is saying no it doesn’t,"" said Ballard Spahr lawyer Alan Kaplinksy, a leader of the firm's consumer financial services group.

""I think Trump will ultimately prevail here, but it’s going to end up in litigation regardless of the opinion the White House is seeking from the Office of Legal Counsel,"" Kaplinsky said. ""The issue could ultimately end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, but in the meantime who’s running the agency? It will be very unclear who has authority to govern the agency.""

At other agencies, including Office of Management and Budget, the Small Business Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, Congress expressly provided for a deputy to take over a vacant leadership post, Kaplinsky said.

Barney Frank, the former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and an architect of the Dodd-Frank Act, said the 2010 law was deliberately written to prevent the president from naming an interim director.

""It was part of an overall suite of arrangements to give the CFPB as much insulation as you could give a federal agency,"" Frank told POLITICO. ""The procedure that Rich Cordray followed was very specifically put into the law to preserve the independence of the CFPB.""

Democrats under President Barack Obama faced a similar situation when they wanted to replace Edward DeMarco as acting head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, an independent regulator with a structure similar to the CFPB. The only way to replace DeMarco was with a confirmed nominee or, barring that, by elevating an FHFA deputy already in place, Frank said.

""He could only be replaced by one of his named deputies; that was the restriction,"" Frank said. ""Nobody claimed the Vacancy Act preempted the FHFA then.""

An ongoing lawsuit could add to the confusion of the bureau's leadership -- or settle it. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington is weighing whether the bureau's structure is constitutional, given the vast power vested in its sole director. An opinion in that case could come at any time.

English joined the agency during its earliest days under Elizabeth Warren, who fought to create the bureau and set it up before being elected to the Senate.

Until English's appointment Friday, the deputy director position had been vacant for nearly two years, with David Silberman, the bureau's associate director of research, markets, and regulations, serving in an acting capacity during that time. The CFPB press office did not respond to requests for comment.

""This is almost laughable what’s going on,"" said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association and a longtime critic of the agency. ""No one should be surprised Richard Cordray did this. I just hope Leandra English is not a pawn.""","federal aviation administration congress

Jack Shafer,A failed coup and a national obsession with an elderly cleric embroiled Trump’s formed national security adviser in scandal.,2017-11-25T13:11:00Z,politico,Turkey’s Torrid Love Affair With Michael Flynn,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/25/michael-flynn-turkey-215865,https://static.politico.com/02/ab/b0eb33d34cc2ad5210ccbfddfe9b/171125flynngettyimages-634600128.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"ISTANBUL—Were Michael Flynn a Turkish citizen, it’s very likely he would be sitting in prison right now, awaiting trial for terror crimes.

In July of 2016, before he briefly became Donald Trump’s national security adviser, the former general was giving a speech in Cleveland just as soldiers were taking over the bridges and airports of Istanbul. “There’s an ongoing coup going on in Turkey right now—right now!” Flynn told his audience. The Turkish military, he continued, was a secular institution, whereas the country was heading “toward Islamism” under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His audience broke into applause; the event was hosted by a local branch of ACT for America, a national security group with strong Islamophobic tendencies. “Yeah,” Flynn said, “that is worth applauding.”

Story Continued Below

By morning, however, the coup had failed, and the Turkish government was busy detaining anyone it believed had supported the plotters. Any Turkish citizen heard making such remarks, and on video, would undoubtedly have been arrested and jailed, as Erdogan’s government considers supporting the coup attempt an act of terrorism. Of the tens of thousands of people detained over the past year, many had said not a word about the coup; just having a certain app, a certain one-dollar bill, even a daughter born in a certain hospital counts as incriminating evidence in Turkey’s highly politicized courts.

Any foreign official would, at the very least, have been roundly condemned and vilified in the Turkish pro-government press. But for Flynn, Turkey appeared happy to make an exception. For, by the time the video surfaced last November, Flynn had performed a heel turn, lobbying in favor of Erdogan’s government and denouncing the man Ankara holds responsible for the failed putsch: Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Flynn also met in September and December last year with senior Turkish officials—including energy minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan’s son-in-law—to discuss kidnapping Gülen and delivering him to Turkey, an allegation now being investigated as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Thursday, it emerged that Flynn’s lawyer had stopped sharing information with Trump’s legal team, a sign he may be cooperating with the investigation—with potentially portentous results for the president.

Kidnapping allegations aside, Flynn was, at least, one of very few senior Western officials who publicly agreed with Ankara’s view that Gülen was a threat —even though his worldview is firmly at odds with that of the Turkish government. Erdogan has his roots in political Islamism, an ideology Flynn considers a dire threat. During his brief tenure as national security adviser, he pushed for Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood — whose exiled leadership has found a safe haven in Turkey — to be designated a terrorist group. He has described Islam as a “cancer,” and at one point last year tweeted: “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.”

Turkey is well aware of Flynn’s anti-Muslim sentiments: “He’s an Islamophobe,” says Hilal Kaplan, a prominent columnist for Sabah, a newspaper with close ties to the Turkish government. But to Ankara, getting at Gülen trumps all else. In Turkey, no day goes by without mention of the cleric: Erdogan, who has pledged to bring him home to face justice, denounces him in daily speeches. The country is deeply divided on many issues, but Gülen is despised by both supporters and opponents of the government; many Turks believe he and his followers present an ongoing threat to their security, fearful that they might plan another coup.

Flynn’s Islamophobic rhetoric may not have won him any friends in Ankara, but he seemed a useful ally in pushing the new administration to extradite Turkey’s public enemy No. 1. “I don’t appreciate his thoughts on the Middle East and Islam,” Kaplan said of Flynn. “I don’t think he’s on the same page with Turkey on everything. But on the Gülen issue, he made a positive contribution.”

Flynn’s worldview would not have prevented the Turkish government from trying to work with him, believes Özgür Ünlühisarcıklı, the Ankara office director of the German Marshall Fund think tank: “From what I understand, the Turkish government is said to have made a business deal,” he said, referring to the alleged kidnapping plot. For that, he added, “they didn’t need to like him.”

Now, as he contemplates the smoking ruins of a once-promising career, the retired lieutenant general faces a potential indictment for failing to come clean on his dealings with Turkey—a predicament that is all the more tragic because Turks couldn’t care less about Michael Flynn.



***

From her office in Sabah’s Istanbul newsroom, Kaplan has an unobstructed view of the first of three bridges spanning the Bosphorus, the strait dividing Europe and Asia. Once called simply Bosphorus Bridge, it was renamed as 15 July Martyrs’ Bridge last year, in honor of those who died resisting the putschists.

The coup attempt caught Turks by surprise. The military had unseated several governments in the second half of the 20th century, but Erdogan had long curbed the generals’ ability to interfere. And Turks no longer tolerated military rule: As the news broke on the night of July 15 last year, thousands of citizens took to the street, facing down guns and tanks to demonstrate against the takeover. The Bosphorus Bridge saw some of the worst violence.

“I was on the bridge on the night of the coup,” Kaplan said. “Bullets were flying all around us. At some point, I thought my husband was dead. I left home, saying goodbye to my child. That’s just an example of what we went through that night.”

By the time the soldiers on the bridge surrendered at sunrise, more than 250 people had died across the country. Parliament and other government buildings in Ankara had been bombed by rebel jets. Turks often complain that foreigners do not understand the magnitude of the trauma caused by the event; many, including Kaplan, liken the coup’s emotional impact to the 9/11 attacks, a comparison also made by the U.S. consul in Istanbul.

Many Turks feel their Western allies showed no solidarity with them in the aftermath of the coup. Messages of condolence and support often came tinged with criticism as Erdogan embarked on a sweeping purge in the days after the attempted takeover, arresting thousands of judges, civil servants and ordinary citizens accused of belonging to Gülen’s secretive movement, an opaque network running schools and businesses across the globe, including in the United States. The purge soon widened to include opponents of all stripes, including Kurdish parliamentarians and critical journalists. One year on, 55,000 people sit behind bars.

Ankara was enraged at Western emphasis on rule of law in the failed coup’s immediate aftermath. “Turkey expected support,” said Talha Köse, a professor at Istanbul’s Ibn Haldun University and researcher at SETA, a think tank with close ties to the Turkish government. “After the coup, Russia was the first country to express support. Unfortunately American involvement was very late and very weak.” Russian President Vladimir Putin, Erdoğan noted in a speech last year, did not ask him about the number of people detained when he called.

The feeling of a lack of solidarity was compounded by Western skepticism over Turkey’s claim that Gülen, an elderly cleric who had been living in self-imposed exile since the 1990s, had orchestrated the coup. Commenting on Ankara’s extradition request, then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on Turkey to provide “legitimate evidence.” European intelligence services have expressed doubt that the cleric’s followers, known as Gülenists, were solely responsible for the coup attempt, instead believing that a mix of Gülenists and disenchanted officers were to blame.

There are plenty of signs that Gülenists did indeed play a role in the coup attempt—several Gülenist civilians were detained at an airbase taken over by mutinous officers, for instance—but Turkey has so far not provided solid evidence implicating the cleric himself. Gülen, meanwhile, has denied any involvement in the coup. The cleric and his movement present themselves as advocates for moderate Islam and interfaith dialogue.

But to most Turks, both supporters and opponents of the government, Gülen was the obvious culprit. Many here compare his movement to a sect or a mafia, given the degree of secrecy surrounding it. Gülenists used to wield considerable influence in Turkey, with followers in all branches of the state; they stand accused of infiltrating government institutions over decades. Gülenist jurists are widely considered—both by Turks across the political spectrum and by independent analysts—to have staged sham trials against government opponents and critics of the exiled cleric and his movement.

Gülen was once a key ally of the president; after Erdogan came to power, the cleric’s followers in state institutions proved helpful in dismantling the influence of the old secular elite. Years prior to the coup attempt, however, his movement became an enemy of the government. The breaking point came in 2013, when Gülenists are thought to have leaked the tapes that sparked a graft scandal embroiling Erdogan’s inner circle.

Kaplan estimates that “90 percent of Turkish people think this coup is related to Fethullah Gülen and his people.” What especially angers Turks, she said, is that “we saw no sympathy from the U.S. regarding this issue.” There are no surveys to back up her estimate, but in Turkey, few challenge the government’s assertion that Gülen masterminded the coup. Opposition groups despised the movement long before the 2013 corruption scandal, given its persecutions of critics. Even Kurdish nationalists—often at odds with Turkish public opinion—loathe the Gülenists, blaming them for the arrest of hundreds of Kurdish activists.

Reports of the movement’s size vary—estimates range from hundreds of thousands to several million members—but these days, it doesn’t take much to be labelled a Gülenist in Turkey. A child born in a hospital linked to the movement, or a mortgage at a Gülen-linked bank is enough cause for arrest. Owning a one-dollar bill with certain serial numbers and downloading a niche messaging app allegedly used by the movement are believed to denote membership. The scale of the purge is vast: 8 percent of all citizens have been investigated. The government says these measures are necessary to dismantle the threat of another coup.

“Turkey is concerned that the Gülen organisation is still very strong,” said Köse. “They tried to infiltrate the state … it’s such a complex network, it’s in all segments of society. That’s very difficult for Americans and other Westerners to understand.”

When Trump won the elections, Turkey’s government was relieved. During the campaign, Erdogan had reacted to Trump’s anti-Muslim comments with anger, at one point demanding that his name be taken off the Trump Towers in Istanbul. But after Trump declared victory, pro-government newspapers struck an optimistic tone. Turkey’s government cheered for Trump largely because they were concerned about the alternative: Hillary Clinton would represent a continuation of the previous administration, and Ankara had grown disenchanted with Barack Obama, particularly due to his support for the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia in Syria.

The U.S. trained and equipped the YPG, which Washington considers its most reliable ally in the fight against the Islamic State. Turkey, however, sees the group as a threat: The YPG is the Syrian wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has fought a violent insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. Clinton was sure to continue U.S. support for the YPG; Trump apparently has just agreed to end it. Moreover, Turkey believed she had ties to the Gulenists as the movement’s members had donated to campaign groups linked to the Democratic nominee. According to USA Today, for instance, a key coup suspect donated $5,000 to the Ready for Hillary PAC in 2014.

Flynn’s comments about Gülen likely added to Turkey’s optimistic view of Trump; here was a soon-to-be senior U.S. government official who seemed to understand the serious threat the cleric presented to Turkey. An editorial in Sabah, which tends to reflect the opinions of the Turkish government, declared that Trump would have won if the U.S. elections were held in Turkey. “Trump and his advisers expressed opinions, particularly about Gülen and the Middle East, which were much closer to Turkey’s theses” than the Clinton campaign’s, the editorial continued, proceeding to quote Flynn extensively.

Shortly after the coup attempt, a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin, approached Flynn’s consulting firm to improve Ankara’s image in the U.S. Flynn accepted the $530,000 lobbying contract. In September, the former general met Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoğlu and Erdogan’s son Albayrak, according to ex-CIA director James Woolsey, who also attended. At this meeting, Flynn reportedly discussed removing Gulen from the United States, Woolsey told the Wall Street Journal. At the second meeting, Flynn and his son, Micheal Flynn Jr., were allegedly offered up to $15 million in exchange for bringing the cleric to Turkey, the Journal reported. Both Flynn’s lawyer and the Turkish embassy in Washington have denied the reports. (Turkish government officials contacted for this article did not respond to requests for comment.)

On Election Day, Flynn then published an op-ed in the Hill, a small, Congress-focused newspaper, lauding Turkey as a “source of stability” in the Middle East and painting Gülen as a “shady mullah” in charge of a terror network. “From Turkey’s point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden,” Flynn wrote. The pro-government media enthusiastically quoted from his article. “Gülenists gripped with fear after Trump chief adviser’s words,” exulted the pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak.

Soon afterward, Trump appointed Flynn as his national security adviser. “A big blow from Trump to the Gülenists!” was Sabah’s reaction to the news. By then, Flynn’s contract with Alptekin had ended, but he may have still had Turkey’s interests on his mind: In January, he reportedly told Obama’s outgoing national security adviser, Susan Rice, to hold off making a decision about arming the YPG to take over Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital.

Ahead of the inauguration, Flynn met with Cavusoglu yet again; the Turkish foreign minister even tweeted about the meeting. Despite the 2016 video that showed him cheering on the coup attempt and his Islamophobic rhetoric, Ankara evidently considered the former general a potential ally, says Ilhan Tanir, a Turkish journalist based in Washington and an editor for Ahval, a news website critical of the Turkish government.

“I think they saw something in Flynn,” Tanir said. “They were hopeful, so they overlooked it all.”



***

Yet Turkey’s enchantment with Trump soon dissipated when it became clear that the new president would neither put a stop to U.S. cooperation with the YPG, nor call for Gülen’s extradition.

“Reality has struck: Trump is unable to deliver on Turkey’s demands, including Erdogan’s demand regarding the extradition of Fethullah Gülen,” said Kemal Kirisci, director of the Turkey Project at the Brookings Institute in Washington. Gülen and the YPG were not the only blows to Turkish-U.S. ties this year: The trial against Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish businessman accused of helping Iran evade sanctions, begins later this month in New York.

Rumors that Zarrab might plead guilty and cooperate with the prosecution have unnerved the Turkish government; prosecutors reportedly have evidence that suggests Erdogan or his family may have known about or even supported Zarrab’s actions. According to NBC, Mueller’s investigation is also examining whether Flynn discussed ways to free Zarrab with Turkish officials last December.

And in October, the United States suspended the processing of non-immigrant visas in Turkey following the arrest of a Turkish citizen employed by the U.S. consulate in Istanbul, who had been accused of links to Gülen followers. Turkey, in turn, also suspended visa processing in the United States and stopped issuing visas on entry for U.S. citizens.

Among Turks, anti-Americanism has surged since the attempted coup, propelled by what many perceive as U.S. protection of Gülen. Erdogan has upped his anti-Western rhetoric and signaled deeper cooperation with Moscow; Turkey, a NATO member country, recently signed a deal to buy Russian air defense missiles. With America refusing to extradite Gülen and arming the Kurds, Turkey feels as if Washington does not take its national security concerns seriously. “Zarrab, Gülen, the YPG—these all come back to Turkey’s national security,” Kaplan said. The United States, she suggested, could at least detain Gülen as a signal of goodwill to Ankara.

Flynn’s op-ed, meanwhile, still gets the occasional citation in Turkey’s pro-government press. His name regularly crops up whenever a development in the Mueller probe hits the news wires; one pro-government pundit suspected the Gülenists behind the investigation into Flynn, writing that the “CIA-Pentagon and media powers behind the Gülenists” were targeting Flynn for the Hill op-ed. Yet despite his alleged deal with Ankara, Flynn’s legal predicaments do not get many column inches—which likely reflects the government’s lack of interest.

“It was not a long-term relationship. There’s no deeper investment in Flynn,” said Köse, the academic. Mueller’s investigation into the former general’s activities, he added, “is not a huge issue” for the Turkish government.

Blame the Media.,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/25/want-to-know-why-roy-moore-might-win-blame-the-media-215863,https://static.politico.com/05/14/2c37862a487fadf8ca8f12c83698/171120-roy-moore-media-gty-1160.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"In the wake of the Roy Moore fiasco, a number of “hot takes” have made their rounds in the media. How obviously hypocritical it is, for example, for evangelical leaders to stand behind a man crediblay accused of sexually assaulting a minor. The dim-witted tribalism of people like Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who all but said she’d elect Jack the Ripper to the Senate as long as he pledged to overturn Roe v. Wade. How Donald Trump could spend most of the 2016 campaign and beyond reveling in accusations against Bill Clinton—that Clinton of course denies—while taking Moore’s own denials at their word. And more to the point, how the president, accused of sexual misconduct by far more women than Senator Al Franken has been, still couldn’t resist taunting Franken from his (undoubtedly gold-tinged) glass house.

All of these are deserving of comment, to be sure. But there is one hot take that the media seems to be missing—the one about the role it has played in creating this sad, sordid, sickening mess in the first place.

Story Continued Below

How have we reached a point in this country when nearly half the voters of a U.S. state so mistrust, and even revile, major media outlets that they are willing to brush aside credible evidence and elect an accused sexual predator simply out of spite? How have we reached a point where a president of the United States can just declare “fake” news he doesn’t like—and largely get away with it?

In at least one survey, trust in the media—the necessary vanguard of any free society—is even lower than trust in Trump, which itself is nothing to tweet about. How on earth has this happened?

It is easy, of course, to blame Trump himself—and his shrewd if unseemly campaign to delegitimize any and all media outlets that criticize him. It’s also easy to dismiss a certain segment of voters as simply being—er, deplorable. But that’s not the reason we are here—in an era where some 50 people can credibly report sexual misconduct allegations about a Senate candidate to a major newspaper and yet that candidate still has a chance to win. This despite the fact that the allegations are coming from the very same newspaper whose credible reporting once helped bring down a Republican president.

No, the real reason for a situation that allows the Roy Moores and Donald Trumps of the world to rise above mere laughingstock status is that the media has totally lost its connection with a large portion of the nation, almost all of them conservatives. Worse, the media has become what Trump and allies refer to as “the opposition party”—and, as such, a most useful foil for the Trump administration.

This problem is real. The anger against the mainstream media is deep-seated. And, as difficult it is for many to accept, much of the anger is justified.

For many years, while Trump was still choosing fake apprentices on a TV show and Moore was still wandering in front of Hot Topic and Forever 21 at the local mall, the media—and by that I mean the major networks, most major newspapers and cable news programs outside of Fox—has displayed a vexing double standard against conservatives. Those in the media unwilling to even see that as a possibility—and I’m sure there are many—are hopelessly lost to their own biases.

Remember all of the hostile press conferences and exchanges that Washington reporters routinely had with the Obama White House, or when Obama’s daily utterances were challenged every day on CNN? Conservatives don’t. Although Obama veterans surely see it differently, the press corps offered largely favorable coverage of the Obama years—at least when compared to Republican administrations. Plenty of surveys bare that out. Such as this one. And this one. And articles such as this one. And this one—this one, too. Conservatives do remember, however, the endless attacks on Reagan’s mental abilities, on George H. W. Bush’s alleged out-of-touch elitism, and on his son’s various verbal miscues and alleged racial insensitivity.

And then there’s the media’s constant and well known distrust of Republican motives. While the bungled rollout of Obamacare, and its website glitches, did get its fair share of negative coverage back in the day, few if any prominent mainstream journalists ever doubted the president’s intentions or his commitment to helping improve the lives of his fellow Americans. Can the same be said of coverage of Reagan’s welfare reform program or George W. Bush’s effort to respond to Hurricane Katrina or the Republican Congress’ current tax cut plan? Conservatives certainly don’t think so.

Were there long, online trackers of Obama’s every “lie” or misstatement as there are of the current Republican president’s? Of course not. Trump is unarguably a special case when it comes to bending the truth, but all presidents stretch the truth from time to time—Obama included. As CNN’s own Jake Tapper recently noted, “President Obama said things that weren’t true and got away with it more for a variety of reasons, and one is the media was much more supportive of him.” I’m not by any means a defender of Trump, but it’s hard to argue the media is attempting to offer any semblance of balance in the light of studies, such as Harvard’s, that showed 93 percent of Trump’s media coverage has been negative.

Trump supporters—as well as conservatives who might not otherwise be inclined to support Trump—have noticed. And it means that today, many on the right simply have no use for the mainstream media. Fox News would have no purpose, no reason for being, if more conservatives felt that their views were getting a “fair and balanced” perspective on the major networks. Indeed, one year ago nearly half the nation elected as a president a man whose most important qualification for high office seemed to be that the media hated him.

What can be done to change this sentiment?

Plenty, of course. And it’s pretty obvious stuff.

For one, networks could end the customary two- or three- or four- on one panels discussing the news of the day where people like former Reagan aide Jeffrey Lord and/or some other person no one has ever heard of are the lone defenders of the “conservative view” against a slew of heavy-hitting liberals. For another, news organizations seeking to report on the issues affecting the entire nation in an unbiased fashion might want to hire more reporters who haven’t spent much of their lives in the Acela corridor, where the last Republican they voted for was Michael Bloomberg. Hint for recruiters: If everyone you hire knows immediately what the Acela corridor is, keep looking.

Of course the first step is for the heads of the major media outlets to actually care about the problem. Despite a few half-hearted efforts during the aftershocks of 2016 election to try to better understand the Trump voters that many reporters didn’t know even existed, it’s not clear that most really do care. There’s very little incentive in today’s tribal climate to try to offer a more balanced picture on various issues or to hear out the other side—to have a frame of mind that accepts that maybe tax cuts can help spur job growth, or maybe the Obama administration did make some mistakes, or maybe every single thing Trump does and says isn’t by definition an outrage requiring days of focus and attention, or maybe federal regulations have in some cases gone too far, or maybe there are other smart, well-meaning Republicans who aren’t Susan Collins or Lindsey Graham.

But the unwillingness to address this problem now could well lead to a second Trump administration—and all of the horrors that might be unleashed on the world as a result. And a reluctant-to-change media will be as much to blame for that anyone else.

Owen S. Good,Drivers team up for 158 hours of torture,2017-11-25T20:57:34Z,polygon,Desert Bus for Hope eclipses $4 million lifetime mark,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/25/16699704/desert-bus-for-hope-2017-total,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqI-zHbe-Z9jRcrArFhrRcbERDI=/0x65:576x367/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/5898821/desert_bus.0.jpg,gaming,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"For the first time in 11 marathons, Desert Bus for Hope’s charity drive did not eclipse the total raised in the previous year. That said, this year’s escapade still pulled in more than $650,000 and the series has eclipsed $4 million in donations all time.

Desert Bus For Hope 11 pulled in $651,031.50 in donations, enough to obligate the driving team of Loading, Ready Run to 158 hours of nonstop “action” at the wheel of the Most Intentionally Bad Video Game of All Time. That’s 12 hours short of a full week.

Desert Bus for Hope is like one of those marathon fundraisers where someone at work or school asks you to commit a certain amount, and then they walk or run a certain distance, with the dough going to a charity. In this case, the distance is time behind the wheel of Desert Bus, a minigame from the unreleased Penn & Teller’s Smoke & Mirrors for Sega CD, in which players drive a touring bus at 45 mph, in real time, between Tucson, Ariz. and Las Vegas. One completed trip earns the player one (1) point. Wrecking the bus means it is towed back to its originating city, also in real time.

The donation goals compound, meaning that the early hours of driving are “bought” very cheaply but the later ones “cost” thousands of dollars. Loading, Ready Run estimates that, under the current donation formula it applies ($1 for the first hour, every additional hour 7 percent more than the preceding one) it would take more than $1 million to make them bus for a full week. So, truly, both sides were giving until it hurt.

Over its lifespan, Desert Bus for Hope has raised $4,465,440 for Child’s Play, the philanthropy of Penny Arcade that buys and delivers toys and video games to children’s hospitals, domestic violence shelters and advocacy centers.

Desert Bus for Hope is one of the oldest video game charity marathons. Publicity surrounding it over the past decade has not only increased contributions to its cause, it’s spawned other charity marathons that have raised thousands for other foundations and organizations, too.

Awesome Games Done Quick, the speed-running marathon which began a little more than two years after Desert Bus for Hope, has raised $6.7 million lifetime for Doctors Without Borders. It gets going again on Jan. 7.","desert

Owen S. Good,"Told they were earning one amount, actually awarded another",2017-11-25T15:12:01Z,polygon,Destiny 2 XP advancement system changed after players cry foul,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/25/16698890/destiny-2-xp-scaling-throttled-cooldown-limit-bungie,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0vAMTAgrBdiTNun-lnFd41gkoEA=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9219375/d2_titan_public_event_01.jpg,gaming,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Destiny 2’s progression system for players beyond level 20 will change, following player outcry over a system of diminishing experience-point returns that players suspected was steering them toward buying the game’s loot box item.

In a post yesterday evening, Bungie announced that it is deactivating a progression system that reduced XP gains for certain events “that can be quickly, repeatedly chained, like grinding Public Events.

“We are not happy with the results, and we’ve heard the same from the community,” Bungie wrote.

The outcry began about three weeks ago, and has its strongest basis in this analysis in the Destiny subreddit. Written by Redditor EnergiserX, it spoke to many players’ individual observations of how their own progression was going since last weekend’s initial “Clarion Call” public event, which gave an XP bonus to those who played it with fellow clan members.

Over the course of three tests, EnergiserX determined “there is a hidden scaling factor that ramps up as you earn XP more quickly.” Moreover, Destiny 2’s public events were only delivering half of the XP they promised.

The rate of XP accrual is important because, after level 20, each time a player fills up their XP bar they’re entitled to a Bright Engram, which is Destiny 2’s loot box equivalent — as in, it can be bought for real money via in-game purchase. Like loot boxes in other games, a Bright Engram contains cosmetic items, typically emotes, ships or weapon skins.

“Over the 3 hours [of play time] I should have earned ~1.5 more Bright Engrams than I did,” EnergiserX concluded. That comports with other players’ complaints since the Clarion Call event was first offered a week ago, in which players noticed that successive completions of the 5,000 XP event actually filled their XP bar less and less each time.

Redditor IbeLIEvel reported the same experience in this thread, with screenshots, confirming that a Bright Engram runs about 80,000 XP. “On the first event completion, the amount needed for my next bright engram went down correctly according to DIM,” they wrote. “On the second public event completion, I again checked DIM and received barely any XP.”

In Bungie’s defense, placing a limitation on repeatedly grinding a public event to farm Bright Engrams is a reasonable intention, to keep farming behavior from warping the game’s virtual economy, depleting the game of items to award or debasing the value — or accomplishment of earning — a Bright Engram. Players acknowledge that’s a legitimate concern.

“If Bungie wants a cooldown on this to stop us from [spamming] public events to get XP, that's a different discussion,” notes IbeLIEvel, “but we should at least have this communicated to us appropriately in the UI. Don't show us +9k if we're not getting +9k.”

That kind of discrepancy, in light of the loot box controversy in Star Wars Battlefront 2, made players quick to suspect this system was meant to encourage buying Bright Engrams in Destiny 2’s Eververse store. That was apparently enough to get Bungie to pull the plug on this kind of XP cooldown scenario and think over what to do next.

“As a result, players will see XP earn rates change for all activities across the board, but with all values being displayed consistently in the user interface,” Bungie wrote. “Over the course of the next week, we will be watching and reviewing XP game data to ensure that these changes meet our expectations, as well as yours. Any additional updates to this system will be communicated to you via our official channels.”","of

After the first day was cancelled due to some unavoidable, and unfortunate, technical issues, the entire tournament will now be played in one day.

Six of the highest ranked teams in the world set to face off in the tournament’s 5 round group stage, before the field is narrowed down for the playoffs and finals.

Why you should watch

Unlike many other CS:GO tournaments that bring in a large variety of teams, the action for BLAST Pro is centered almost exclusively on the best in the world. Six of the seven best teams currently competing will be facing off at the tournament, meaning that every single match should be even and unpredictable.

Adding to the tournament’s drama are the events of IEM Oakland just last week, where Ninjas in Pyjamas left as champions. Just a few months ago the Ninjas seemed like a weak link among the other teams in Copenhagen for BLAST Pro, but after their recent roster moves and incredible performance last weekend, Ninjas in Pyjamas have gone from underdogs to tournament frontrunners almost overnight as they moved from the ninth in HLTV’s team rankings, to third.

Meanwhile, both Faze Clan and SK Gaming — the first and second-ranked teams in the world — will be looking to use this tournament as the perfect stage for revenge against Ninjas in Pyjamas, who knocked both teams out of the playoffs at IEM Oakland, during the finals and semifinals respectively.

Allegra Frank,"There’s a list — not a long one, but there’s a list",2017-11-24T21:57:28Z,polygon,Everything new in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/24/16692182/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-new-features-differences,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcwvIZdcKBPVEm2FU70V6hc-29I=/0x1433:2480x2731/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9592913/Battle_Agency.jpg,gaming,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon are neither very different from each other, nor from last year’s Pokémon Sun and Moon. It’s worth highlighting the exclusive content that both games do have, however — especially if you’re trying to decide if checking them out after beating Sun and Moon is worth your while.

The Pokémon Company provided a helpful list of new features, but we’ve added a few finds of our own.

A new minigame: Mantine Surf

Scattered across Alola’s beaches are opportunities to check out this new minigame. Mantine Surf is what it sounds like: Trainers can grab onto a Mantine and surf the waves. Doing special tricks will grant you additional points toward your overall score, as will avoiding other Pokémon hanging out in the waters. Prizes are then awarded based on that score; these are typically Battle Points, which can be traded for further rewards.

Your mileage may vary on this one; I’m not a huge fan of the controls in particullar. But surfing is still a decent pasttime for anyone looking to get more out of their adventure.

A new online mode: Battle Agency

In the online multiplayer hub, the Festival Plaza, players will find an additional battle ground among its returning offerings. This is called the Battle Agency, where players can rent Pokémon to try fighting with a new kind of team. These Pokémon are a combination of the Battle Agency’s supply and trainers also checking out the Festival Plaza. It’s kind of reminiscent of Pokémon Stadium’s rent-a-Pokémon feature, which was a cool way to test out the battle readiness of certain Pokémon you’re on the fence about.

A new trial: Fairy-type

There’s an extra Island Trial to tackle in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, and it’s both an exciting and infuriating one. After defeating Necrozma during the game’s climax — which we’ll get to in a second — players are sent to Mina, the laid-back master behind the Fairy-type challenge. It’s both a fetch quest and a test of serious strength, as players have to travel around Alola finding all the other Island Trial Captains for a rematch. Finding them is a total pain in the neck, if you ask me, but at the more difficult fights are a decent trade-off.

An actual gym!

The biggest difference between the seventh-gen Pokémon games and their forebearers is probably the lack of traditional gyms. Island Trials replace gym leaders; Z-Crystals replace badges. I found this to be a nice change of pace back during Sun and Moon, but for Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, I found these challenges to already be a little stale. (It didn’t help that they were almost exactly the same in these games as the previous ones.) Thankfully, there’s now a gym-style battle arena to take part in. A quartet of trainers battle players as they make their way to a leader. It’s a familiar setup with a key difference: These gyms are replayable on a daily basis.

Totem Stickers

Like everyone who grew up on the Nintendo 64, I’m a sucker for collect-a-thons. That’s not to say I love them, but I can’t help but take part in them anyway. For anyone else with this compulsion, this pair of games throws Totem Stickers into the mix. These golden badges decorate buildings all around Alola, and ripping them off will earn players gigantic Pokémon. Yup. It’s ... kind of rad, actually.

A legendary Pokémon gets more spotlight

Necrozma was a more subdued presence in Sun and Moon, but the legendary Pokémon plays a larger role in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Expanding Necrozma’s role has interesting ramifications for the story, which was always the best part of the seventh-gen games anyway. It features in a climactic fight for trainers toward the end of the games’ storyline, and it even appears in a handful of new forms. Legendary monsters Solgaleo and Lunala even fuse with Necrozma and gain new looks and abilities in the process.

An expanded postgame — and fighting familiar villains

It’s not just a menacing Pokémon who returns. The leaders of every enemy organization from prior Pokémon games appear in the new pair of games, forming a supergroup called Team Rainbow Rocket. Why it took this long to do this is beyond me, but it’s arguably one of the most rad throwbacks for nostalgic fans in these upgraded versions. Players won’t encounter them after they’ve defeated the Elite Four, at which point Team Rainbow Rocket plays a major role in the postgame. (They even have their own Castle where players will fight a gauntlet of foes.)

More Pokémon to catch

I covered this in our story on the differences between each version, but to recap: Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon allow players to catch every legendary Pokémon between them. Which ones are accessible depends on which game players own, but that’s what trading is for. There are also a smattering of new Ultra Beasts and an exclusive mythical monster to collect as well. Many of these are accessible by traveling through wormholes; yeah, these games get kind of weird.

If this sounds like enough new content for you, then have at it. For more on my thoughts on whether these games make it worth heading back to Alola, read my impressions.","pokémon stadium’s rentapokémon

Try your local Best Buy this Saturday, Nov. 25. The retailer said in a press release today that it will have “limited quantities” of the SNES Classic in Best Buy stores across the United States.

Best Buy stores will open at 9 a.m. local time on Saturday, and the SNES Classic will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Here’s how that will work, per Best Buy:

The Super NES Classic Edition will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Our stores will offer a ticketing process before we open for customers waiting in line – the same ticketing process we’ll offer for the Saturday doorbuster deals. We will only pass out as many tickets as we have systems available, with a limit of one per customer. Super NES Classic Edition will not be available on BestBuy.com.

Related SNES Classic review

Nintendo launched the SNES Classic in September, and while getting your hands on the miniature console at launch wasn’t as hard as it was for its predecessor, the NES Classic, it’s not like the system has regularly been in stock since then. (Hence why Best Buy is making a big deal out of getting more stock.)

Don’t expect any Black Friday/Cyber Monday-style deals on the console, which costs $79.99 and comes with 21 preinstalled games.","bestbuycom related snes classic

Colin Campbell,Statement warns of blurred lines,2017-11-24T19:01:57Z,polygon,UK Gambling Commission weighs in on loot crate legality,https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/24/16696974/uk-gambling-commission-loot-crate,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/us-TxJbt62GWMR55yZg4GkUJCjs=/0x18:1080x583/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9745201/star_wars_battlefront_loot_crates.jpg.optimal.jpg,gaming,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The U.K. Gambling Commission today posted a statement clarifying that video game loot boxes do not qualify as gambling under current British law. However, the statement also warns that loot boxes show how “the line between video gaming and gambling is becoming increasingly blurred.”

It's the U.K. Gambling Commission's job to ensure that the country's gambling laws are adhered to. In recent months, the UKGC has stepped into such controversies as skin gambling sites, prosecuting the owners of a website devoted to betting using virtual currencies with real world value.

But for most games, virtual currencies have not outlet into real currencies. This is the line where British law defines gambling.

""A key factor in deciding if that line has been crossed is whether in-game items acquired ‘via a game of chance’ can be considered money or money’s worth,"" states the commission. ""In practical terms this means that where in-game items obtained via loot boxes are confined for use within the game and cannot be cashed out it is unlikely to be caught as a licensable gambling activity. In those cases our legal powers would not allow us to step in.""

Loot boxes in games like Star Wars Battlefront 2 are beginning to attract the attention of lawmakers. Earlier this week, Hawaiian Reps. Chris Lee and Sean Quinlan held a news conference that assailed loot crates as preying on children, naming Star Wars Battlefront 2 specifically.

And in Belgium, the country’s Gaming Commission last week opened an investigation into loot box purchases in video games. The nation’s minister of justice has signaled he wants to go to the European Union to have action taken against games that employ loot crates and in-game purchases.

Electronic Arts suspended in-game transactions in light of the controversy surrounding loot crate systems. The Entertainment Software Association, which represents the interests of games publishers in the United States, recently issued a statement denying that loot crates represent gambling.

""Loot boxes are a voluntary feature in certain video games that provide players with another way to obtain virtual items that can be used to enhance their in-game experiences,"" offered the statement. ""They are not gambling. Depending on the game design, some loot boxes are earned and others can be purchased. In some games, they have elements that help a player progress through the video game. In others, they are optional features and are not required to progress or succeed in the game. In both cases, the gamer makes the decision.""

Despite the UK Gambling Commission's clarification on the legality of loot crates, its statement came very close to outright calling for governmental scrutiny.

""Many parents are not interested in whether an activity meets a legal definition of ‘gambling’. Their main concern is whether there is a product out there that could present a risk to their children.

""We are concerned with the growth in examples where the line between video gaming and gambling is becoming increasingly blurred. Where it does meet the definition of gambling it is our job to ensure that children are protected and we have lots of rules in place, like age verification requirements, to do that.

""Where a product does not meet that test to be classed as gambling but could potentially cause harm to children, parents will undoubtedly expect proper protections to be put in place by those that create, sell and regulate those products. We have a long track record in keeping children safe and we are keen to share our experiences and expertise with others that have a similar responsibility. Whether gambling or not, we all have a responsibility to keep children and young people safe.""

So clever players have found physical ways to cheat the system.

While one player created a simple robot to keep their character moving in order to farm credits without being removed from the game due to inactivity, the same thing can be done by simply adding a few rubber bands to your controller.

You may be hurting your team’s chances at winning and annoying the rest of the players on the server, but this is the world EA and DICE have created. It feels weird to get angry at players who are trying to stretch what’s acceptable inside an economy that was this ill-conceived.

Just in case you want to ruin the game for others while earning enough credits to get whatever you want, this is how it’s done.

It’s hard to get mad at these players due to the fact the economy has been hated since the first days of the beta. Locking away content in this manner and focusing on playing long hours to get credits to try to get the things you want from loot crates that randomly spit out loot gives players an incentive to give up and start farming.

Right now you can get a minimum amount of credits just for showing up, which is what these farms are after. You can increase the amount you earn by doing well and taking part of each objective — and credits are given for playing the campaign and arcade mode as well — so this is merely the easiest way to get credits without putting any actual work into the process.

This is what happens when your economy is bad. Things get sad for everyone, very quickly. These phantom players are going to ruin the online experience, and EA and DICE have no one to blame but themselves.

We’ve reached out to EA and DICE for comment and will update when they respond.","star wars battlefront

The company had to pull back after consumer uproar. Gamers have had enough of crappy free-to-play gouging grafted onto full-price games, a brazen attempt by big companies to squeeze more cash out of their customers.

Modder Rip and Tear has struck a hit against these predatory practices with a clever piece of work: Doom Loot Box Mod.

It's basically 1993 first-person shooter classic Doom, except weapons drops are replaced with occasional loot boxes. These can only be opened with keys dropped randomly (and rarely) by slain enemies. With weapons much harder to find, Doom becomes a more challenging game. But the real point is to mock loot box design. Players can enter a (fake-front) marketplace and peruse purchasable loot boxes and keys.

For a more detailed look at the mod, here's StronkiTube making his way through the early levels, in search of Doom loot.

Each of the items comes at a maximum power level of 270 — a base power of 265, plus a Legendary (purple) mod that raises the value by five. This scales to your character’s power level, so make sure you’re buying Xur exotics on your highest level character.

The Merciless fusion rifle is easily one of the best exotics in Destiny 2. Its exotic perk, Conserve Momentum, causes it to charge its fusion bursts faster for every non-lethal hit you strike. This makes killing bosses very fast. If you have any interest in Nightfalls or the Leviathan raid, Merciless is a must own.

Lucky Pants are fairly worthless in most situations. Their exotic perk, Illegally Modded Holster, allows you to ready hand cannons very quickly as well as increase accuracy for your first shot. If you absolutely must use hand cannons in both your energy and kinetic slot, these pants are for you. Otherwise, skip Lucky Pants.

Mask of the Quiet One is one of the Titan’s top exotics in both PvP and PvE. Its exotic perk, Dreaded Visage, grants energy for your grenade, melee and class ability each time you take damage. Even better, kills with void abilities instantly trigger your health regeneration. While this helmet is best used with Sentinel, you’ll get the extra energy on damage regardless of your subclass. If you’re going to be taking a lot of damage (which you will be in most activities), this is a great exotic.

Starfire Protocol will rarely be a worthwhile exotic. Its perk is Fusion Harness, which grants you an extra charge of fusion grenades and causes fusion grenade kills to grant you Rift energy. The fusion grenades are fairly subpar in Destiny 2 which makes this perk mostly useless. It also requires you to use Dawnblade, which is the least useful of the Warlock specs. If you already love being a Dawnblade and using fusion grenades, then you should absolutely pick this up. If you don’t often use either, skip it.","legendary

Eric Johnson,The Verge’s Tamara Warren breaks down what’s the deal with those Tron-looking trucks (and why they have no mirrors) on Too Embarrassed to Ask.,2017-11-25T17:42:39Z,recode,Will Tesla disrupt the trucking industry?,https://www.recode.net/2017/11/25/16699128/tesla-semi-trucks-elon-musk-tamara-warren-kara-swisher-lauren-goode-too-embarrassed-podcast,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W-zApgTvjDKHmMfOapo-d-sKsyk=/0x146:1440x900/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9699947/Screen_Shot_2017_11_17_at_12.18.19_AM.png,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"If you’re one of the 1,240 people who thought they were getting a Tesla Model 3 this past quarter and didn’t, good news: Tesla is getting into an entirely new product category, short-haul electric semi trucks.

Why is that good news for you, if all you want is an electric sedan? On the latest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask, The Verge’s Tamara Warren said entering the lucrative trucking business — and unveiling a new model of its Roadster sports car, which starts at $200,000 — may give the company the cash it needs to scale up production.

“Tesla has a very loyal customer base,” Warren said. “If you can get people to put down cold hard cash, you’re infusing a company that’s hemorrhaging cash with exactly what it needs, capital.”

Exact pricing for the Tesla Semi was not initially announced at the product event, but yesterday the company confirmed that the 300-mile-range and 500-mile-range models of the Semi would likely cost $150,000 and $180,000, respectively. The first of those trucks are expected to roll out in 2019.

You can listen to the new podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

On the new podcast, Warren explained why Tesla and its competitors are so interested in electric trucks: Switching to batteries may save drivers a truckload of money. And she said a big part of whether Elon Musk and company can succeed is the simultaneous expansion of its charger network across the country, including solar-powered “megachargers” that can deliver 400 miles of range in 30 minutes.

“If a trucker travels 90,000 miles a year — let’s say the cost of fuel for a diesel truck is $2.70 a gallon,” Warren said. “And let’s say that’s 35 cents per mile. If you think about that, for fuel alone, that’s $31,000 to $32,000 that that trucker is spending.”

“If you’re using battery-charging to power your truck, you’re saving thousands of dollars a year and that definitely is lucrative for a lot of truckers when it comes down to it, or their companies,” she added.

She also offered an informed guess about one of the big questions left unanswered by Tesla’s event last week: Why did the new trucks have no mirrors?

“When we see them [at unveilings], things like mirrors are often not included because they're not production vehicles, they’re concepts,” Warren said. “Some of that is regulatory: There are different regulations in the United States versus Europe, for example, where the lights need to be. So I imagine the actual truck we see when it gets delivered, two years from now, will look different.”

No group has claimed responsibility, but Egyptian forces are battling a stubborn Islamic State affiliate in the region, one of the surviving branches of the militant group after it suffered defeats by U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria.

The assault on a mosque has stunned Egyptians, prompting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government to tighten security at places of worship and key buildings, and call three days of mourning for the bloodiest attack in Egypt’s modern history.

State news agency MENA said the death toll had risen to 305, including 27 children, and 128 people were injured.

Egypt’s public prosecutor’s office, citing interviews with wounded survivors as part of its investigation, linked Islamic State militants, also known as Daesh, to the attack on the Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, west of El-Arish city.

“The worshippers were taken by surprise by these elements,” the prosecutor said in a statement. “They numbered between 25 and 30, carrying the Daesh flag and took up positions in front of the mosque door and its 12 windows with automatic rifles.”

The gunmen, some wearing masks and military-style uniforms, had arrived in jeeps, surrounded the mosque and opened fire inside, sending panicked worshippers scrambling over each other to escape the carnage.

Witnesses had said gunmen set off a bomb at the end of Friday prayers and then opened fire as people tried to flee, shooting at ambulances and setting fire to cars to block roads. Images on state media showed bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the mosque.

“When the shooting began everyone was running, and everyone was bumping into one another,” Magdy Rezk, a wounded survivor, said from his hospital bed. “But I was able to make out masked men wearing military clothing.”

UTMOST FORCE

Striking a mosque would be a shift in tactics for the Sinai militants, who have previously attacked troops and police and more recently tried to spread their insurgency to the mainland by hitting Christian churches and pilgrims.

Local sources said some of the worshippers were Sufis, whom groups such as Islamic State consider targets because they revere saints and shrines, which for Islamists is tantamount to idolatry. Islamic State has targeted Sufi and Shi‘ite Muslims in other countries like Iraq.

The jihadists in Egypt’s Sinai have also attacked local tribes and their militias for working with the army and police.

Sisi, a former armed forces commander who supporters see as a bulwark against Islamist militants, promised the “utmost force” against those responsible for Friday’s attack. Security has been a key reason for his supporters to back him, and he is expected to run for re-election next year.

Egypt’s military carried out air strikes and raids overnight to target hideouts and vehicles involved in the attack, the army said, without giving details on the number of militants.

“What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism,” Sisi said on Friday.

The Sinai attack came as Sisi’s government looks to draw more foreign investment and finish an IMF reform program to help revive an economy that struggled through instability after the 2011 uprising ousted long-standing leader Hosni Mubarak.

North Sinai, a mostly desert area stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, has long been a security headache for Egypt and is a strategic region for Cairo because of its sensitive borders.

Local militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, once allied to al Qaeda, split from it and declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. But attacks in the Sinai worsened after 2013 when Sisi led the overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests against his rule.","bir alabed west of elarish city

Roberta Rampton and Idrees Ali,"President Donald Trump has the power he needs to put his top budget aide in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), federal officials said on Saturday, weighing in on a  battle for control over the powerful agency.",2017-11-25T16:59:40Z,reuters,Trump asserts legal power in fight over consumer bureau,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/bZjOGomu5MM/trump-asserts-legal-power-in-fight-over-consumer-bureau-idUSKBN1DP0HE,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171125&t=2&i=1211203560&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDAO0CK,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has the power he needs to put his top budget aide in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), federal officials said on Saturday, weighing in on a battle for control over the powerful agency.

The leadership of the independent regulatory agency was thrown into question on Friday when its outgoing director Richard Cordray, a Democrat, named his deputy as his acting replacement until the U.S. Senate confirms a new director.

The CFPB was created by former Democratic President Barack Obama in the wake of the financial crisis and has imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies for alleged predatory lending practices.

Trump named White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a fierce critic of the agency, to temporarily oversee the CFPB until he nominates someone to take on the job - a pick expected in upcoming weeks, senior administration officials told reporters on a conference call.

Democrats, accusing the White House of finding a backdoor method to defang a banking watchdog, point to language in the Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB, stipulating the deputy director replaces the director when he or she leaves.

But administration officials said the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives presidents the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi-member boards - an exemption that they said did not apply to the CFPB.

“We believe this move by the president is a typical routine move exercised by presidents,” said one of the officials, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, noting the White House had sought guidance from the Justice Department before Trump named Mulvaney to the job.

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel will soon publish a formal view, the officials said.

Cordray was the CFPB’s first director, so this is the first time the agency’s succession plan has been tested.

Republicans have complained the agency is too powerful and lacks oversight from Congress on its operations. Industry critics said the succession battle was a case in point of how the agency had too much power.

“The CFPB’s current governing structure is a dictatorship, period,” Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Democrats and consumer advocates said it was unfair to put Mulvaney - who once described the CFPB as a “joke” - in charge.

Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ financial services committee, said the appointment would give Mulvaney a seat on the boards of two other financial regulatory agencies.

“The White House would have an alarming degree of direct control over financial regulation, supervision, and enforcement,” Waters said in a statement.

‘ENORMOUS CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY’

Trump’s nominee must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, meaning that Mulvaney could be the acting director for months.

The fight has raised practical questions about how the agency would operate when its doors open on Monday.

The White House has not been in touch with Leandra English, the deputy who Cordray put in charge, officials said, saying they expected she would be at work on Monday and continue as Mulvaney’s deputy.

“We don’t have any reason to think that anything out of the ordinary course will happen: we think (Mulvaney) will show up Monday and he will go into the office and start working,” a senior administration official said.

“We have gone out of our way to avoid an unnecessary legal battle with Mr. Cordray and his actions clearly indicate that he’s trying to provoke one,” another official said.

The issue will likely be challenged in courts, which could mean “this enormous cloud of uncertainty” hangs over the CFPB in the meantime, said Alan Kaplinsky, who heads the Consumer Financial Services Group for Ballard Spahr LLP.

Kaplinsky said he believes the Dodd-Frank law provides for the deputy director to take charge during a shorter-term leave, but Congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up.

“I think Trump wins, but unfortunately it is going to take a while,” Kaplinsky said.","house of representatives’ financial services committee

The new law has been rushed through both Russian houses of parliament in the last two weeks. It will now allow Moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to Russians as the work of “foreign agents” and to disclose their funding sources.

A copy of the law was published on the Russian government’s online legislation database on Saturday, saying it entered into force from the day of its publication.

Russia’s move against U.S. media is part of the fallout from allegations that Russia interfered in last year’s U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.

U.S. intelligence officials have accused the Kremlin of using Russian media organizations it finances to influence U.S. voters, and Washington has since required Russian state broadcaster RT to register a U.S.-based affiliate company as a “foreign agent”.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and said the restrictions on Russian broadcasters in the United States are an attack on free speech.

The Russian Justice Ministry last week published a list of nine U.S.-backed news outlets that it said could be affected by the changes.

It said it had written to the U.S. government-sponsored Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), along with seven separate Russian or local-language news outlets run by RFE/RL.","radio free europeradio liberty rferl

But Le Maire also told France Inter radio that he had asked the central Bank of France to look into whether the law had been complied with and that its governor would release his conclusions on Monday.

Le Pen earlier this week accused two banks -- Societe Generale and HSBC -- of launching a “banking fatwa” to silence her National Front party by closing bank accounts belonging to her and her party.

The banks said they had acted within regulatory requirements but declined to offer fuller explanations.

“If Societe Generale closes the accounts of the National Front, and also I point out that another bank closed the personal account of Marine Le Pen, it’s because it had good reasons to do so. I trust French banking institutions,” Le Maire said.

“My duty as economy and finance Minister is to verify the law has been complied with. So I asked the Bank of France.... I am convinced that the law has been complied with and that these banks had good reasons to take these decisions.”

Le Pen was defeated in this year’s presidential election and her party fared poorly in parliamentary elections. She has accused French banks of being politically biased for not lending to her campaigns.","farright national front

The court appearance was the first time Chombo had been seen in public since being detained after the military seized power in “Operation Restore Legacy”, which it said was meant to remove the “criminals” around Mugabe.

Chombo, a Mugabe ally who had been promoted to finance minister in October, told the court that he was kept blindfolded for nine days after being arrested at his home on Nov. 15.

His lawyer has said he was beaten in detention, although Chombo made no mention of that and had no injuries visible as he stood before magistrates in Harare.

Several members of a group allied to Mugabe and his wife Grace were detained and expelled from the ruling party, including Chombo, the ousted head of the influential ZANU-PF youth league Kudzanai Chipanga and a deposed leader in the party’s youth wing, Innocent Hamandishe.

Some supporters of the new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, have been calling for unspecified action against the so-called G40 group that backed Mugabe and his wife. Chombo, Chipanga and Hamandishe were allied to the G40.

Before his inauguration, Mnangagwa on Thursday urged citizens not to undertake any form of “vengeful retribution”.

The state prosecutor said Chombo was charged three counts of corruption, including attempting to defraud the Zimbabwean central bank in 2004, when he was local government minister.

He was not asked to enter a plea by the state. Chombo showed no emotion while the charges were read. The court ordered Chombo detained until Monday when his bail application will be heard.

Describing his arrest, when his wife had also been present, Chombo told the court: “While we stood in the room, there rushed in between five and six people wearing masks and all of them had guns. The guns were pointing at us.”

He said he suffered lacerations on his left side when he fell as the soldiers led him out of his house to a car.

Chombo’s lawyer, Lovemore Madhuku, said on Friday Chombo was admitted to hospital with injuries sustained from beatings he received in military custody.

Chombo had no visible injuries and appeared calm, chatting with the police guarding him when the court took a break.

Chombo was handed over to the police by the military. The police said they had no information on Chombo’s injuries when asked to comment.

A former university lecturer and Mugabe’s ally, Chombo was promoted in an October cabinet reshuffle from the interior ministry to the finance portfolio, against the backdrop of a severe shortage of the U.S. dollar used by Zimbabwe.

In his main act as new finance minister, Chombo told parliament on Nov. 9 that Zimbabwe’s budget deficit would soar to $1.82 billion or 11.2 percent of gross domestic product this year from an initial target of $400 million.

In the same court, Chipanga faced charges of making statements aimed at undermining public confidence in the defence forces and was also detained until Monday when his bail application will be heard. Hamandishe faced six counts of kidnapping and one of publishing falsehoods and was detained in custody until Dec. 8.

MDC DEMANDS ACTION

Mugabe’s fall after 37 years in power was triggered by a battle to succeed him that pitted Mnangagwa against Mugabe’s much younger wife Grace, who is 52.

Mnangagwa, 75, the former vice president sacked by Mugabe this month, was sworn in as president on Friday.

The 93-year-old Mugabe, who had led Zimbabwe from independence in 1980, stepped down on Tuesday after the army seized power and the ruling party turned against him.

On Friday, Zimbabwe’s Judge President George Chiweshe nullified Mugabe’s decision to fire Mnangagwa as his deputy - a move that triggered the military intervention.

In his inauguration speech, Mnangagwa laid out a grand vision to revitalise Zimbabwe’s ravaged economy and vowed to rule on behalf of all the country’s citizens.

The main opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said Mnangagwa’s speech “sounded like he was reading from the MDC policy documents”, it said in a statement.

“As a party, we are flattered to note that President Mnangagwa seems to have radically departed from the usual ZANU-PF drivel such as hate-filled language, empty sloganeering and the rabid promotion of racism and retribution against perceived political foes, both domestically and internationally,” it said.

The MDC demanded concrete action to investigate human rights abuses, steps to tackle corruption, plans for free and fair elections next year and assurances that the military would return to their barracks and stay out of politics.

In the early hours of Saturday, armoured vehicles and soldiers that had been stationed outside government buildings, parliament and the courts returned to Inkomo Barracks outside Harare, one of the soldiers manning the vehicles said.","zanupf youth league kudzanai chipanga

Police in the Chaoyang district said it will further investigate claims of abuse after China’s official Xinhua news agency reported this week they were checking allegations that children at the nursery were “reportedly sexually molested, pierced by needles and given unidentified pills”.

Chaoyang district police said in an online posting on Saturday they had detained a 22-year-old teacher, surnamed Liu from the Hebei province adjacent to Beijing.

Police have also arrested another person, also surnamed Liu, for allegedly disrupting social order by spreading false information about the alleged kindergarten abuse, it said in a separate posting.

RYB’s New York-listed shares plunged 38.4 percent on Friday as the scandal sparked outrage among parents and the public.

The second woman, 31, and a Beijing native, was arrested on Thursday, police said.

Parents said their children, some as young as three, gave accounts of a naked adult male conducting purported “medical check-ups” on unclothed students, other media said.

RYB provides early education services in China and at the end of June was operating 80 kindergartens and had franchised an additional 175, covering 130 cities and towns in China.

Meanwhile, Beijing city authorities have urged RYB to remove the head of the kindergarten, Xinhua reported.

The Chaoyang district has launched an investigation into all childcare facilities in its area, the report said.","ryb education inc

The statement did not specify which countries he meant.

Hariri announced his resignation from his post on Nov. 4 in a televised statement from Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy and regional powerhouse locked in a confrontation with Shi‘ite Iran.

Hezbollah is fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Gulf monarchies have accused the Shi‘ite group of also supporting the Houthi group in Yemen and of backing militants in Bahrain. Hezbollah denies any activity in Yemen or Bahrain.

Hariri’s resignation pitched Lebanon to the forefront of a regional power tussle this month between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which backs Hezbollah. The two regional powers back competing factions in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.

After returning to Lebanon this week, he shelved the decision on Wednesday at the request of President Michel Aoun, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the Middle East.

Following his announcement, made on Lebanon’s independence day, hundreds of Hariri supporters packed the streets near his house in central Beirut, waving the blue flag of his Future Movement political party.

On Saturday, he said that his decision to wait instead of officially resigning is to give a chance to discuss and look into demands that will make Lebanon neutral and allow it to enforce its “disassociation” policy.

“Disassociation” is widely understood in Lebanon to mean its policy of staying out of regional conflicts. The regional role played by the Hezbollah political and military movement has greatly alarmed Saudi Arabia, Hariri’s long-time ally.

On Saturday, Hezbollah’s International Relations Officer Ammar Moussawi said that the Shi‘ite group is ready to reach understandings with “our partners in the country”, and that the group is open to real dialogue and cooperation with all, Lebanon’s state news agency NNA reported.

Moussawi added that Hariri’s resignation, which he said was done under coercion from Riyadh, was a spark that aimed to ignite Lebanon.

Top Lebanese Druze politician Walid Jumblatt on Saturday called on Saudi Arabia to enter dialogue with Iran and said that the kingdom’s modernization plans could not work while Riyadh was engaged in a war in Yemen.","iraq syria lebanon

Dominique Vidalon,French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday unveiled measures aimed at educating the public and schoolchildren about sexism and  violence against women and improving police support for victims.,2017-11-25T15:12:49Z,reuters,France's Macron unveils plan to curb violence against women,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/Xl2mv-OPOrM/frances-macron-unveils-plan-to-curb-violence-against-women-idUSKBN1DP0H9,https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171125&t=2&i=1211203097&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDAO0CE,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday unveiled measures aimed at educating the public and schoolchildren about sexism and violence against women and improving police support for victims.

During his campaign Macron, who won the presidential election in May, promised to rethink sexual politics and gender equality, which he made a national cause for his five-year mandate.

The Harvey Weinstein scandal in the United States has accelerated a rethink of attitudes toward sexual harassment in France, a country that cherishes its self-image as the land of seduction and romance.

“Let’s seal a pact of equality between men and women,” Macron said in a speech marking the International Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women.

About violence and sexual abuse, he said: “It is essential that shame changes camp.”

During his speech, Macron observed a minute’s silence for the 123 women killed by their partner or ex-partner in 2016.

Measures announced include educating secondary school children about pornography and simplifying the system for rape and assault victims to go to the police.

Proposals that could be included in a 2018 draft law include criminalizing street harassment and extending the statute of limitation for the rape of minors to 30 years from 20 years. Macron also said he was personally in favor of setting the age of sexual consent at 15. Currently France has no minimum age for sexual consent.

Planned changes to the police system include allowing victims of rape and sexual assault to make their initial complaints online, before going to a police station to bring criminal charges. Other measures include “on demand” bus stops, where women can stop a bus anywhere at night so they can get home safely.

French feminist group Osez le Féminisme said the measures were going in the right direction but must be accompanied by adequate funding.

“Without funding, any communication, training, awareness or help plan for the victims will be useless,” the statement said.

France has often debated sexual harassment over the past decade following scandals involving French politicians.

Six years ago a sex scandal forced former finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund, provoking a round of soul-searching in France about sexual abuse that goes undetected in the upper echelons of power.","international monetary fund

Madeline Chambers,"Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday welcomed the prospect of talks on a ""grand coalition"" with her Social Democrat (SPD) rivals and defended the record of the previous such government, saying it had worked well.",2017-11-25T15:42:29Z,reuters,Merkel points to grand coalition with Social Democrats,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/WGHuirU5_K0/merkel-points-to-grand-coalition-with-social-democrats-idUSKBN1DP0BP,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171125&t=2&i=1211191062&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDAO087,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday welcomed the prospect of talks on a “grand coalition” with her Social Democrat (SPD) rivals and defended the record of the previous such government, saying it had worked well.

Merkel’s fourth term was cast into doubt when the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) walked out of three-way coalition talks with her conservative bloc and the Greens last Sunday, causing a political impasse in Europe’s biggest economy.

But on Friday, the SPD reversed a previous decision and agreed to talk to Merkel, raising the possibilities of a new “grand coalition” which has ruled Germany for the last four years, or of a minority government.

Addressing party members on Saturday, Merkel argued voters had given her conservatives a mandate to rule in the Sept. 24 election which handed her party the most parliamentary seats but limited coalition options. Her conservatives bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

“Europe needs a strong Germany, it is desirable to get a government in place quickly,” Merkel told a regional party meeting in northern Germany, adding, however, that her acting government could carry on day to day business.

“Asking voters to go to the polls again would, I think be totally wrong,” she said. On Monday, Merkel had said she would prefer new elections to a minority government in which her party would be only held in power by others.

Without even mentioning the option of a minority government, Merkel said she wanted to look ahead after the setbacks of the last week. Sounding self-assured and drawing applause during her speech, she turned her attention fully to the SPD.

Welcoming the prospect of talks with her former partner, she defended the record of the last coalition.

“We worked well together,” she said, adding under the grand coalition, Germany enjoyed the strongest labor market for decades, a balanced budget and pensioners and families had benefited, she argued.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is to host Merkel, SPD leader Martin Schulz and the leader of her conservative CSU sister party for a meeting on Thursday. Steinmeier had exerted considerable pressure on Schulz to change course for the sake of stability in Germany.

SUBSTANCE

However, no one is saying things will be easy and the two former partners are already jostling over policy.

Merkel said her aims are to maintain Germany’s solid finances, cut some taxes and expand the digital infrastructure.

In a nod to her CSU conservative allies, she also said she aims to limit the number of migrants entering Germany to 200,000 per year.

This, however, may be hard for the SPD to swallow.

“A cap, which may not be called that, breaches the constitution and the Geneva Convention. With the SPD there will be no limit put on family members who want to join asylum seekers,” SPD deputy leader Ralf Stegner told the Funke media group.

Schulz, who had until Friday rejected any deal with Merkel, said there was nothing automatic about the outcome and promised party members a vote on talks.

The SPD is split as many members fear that renewing a grand coalition would be political suicide. It scored its worst result since 1933 in the September election.

Several other leading SPD members have called for other commitments, such as investment in education and homes.

Some senior SPD members have made clear that they will not let Merkel hold them hostage. “Mrs Merkel is not in a position to be setting conditions,” Malu Dreyer, premier of the state of Rhineland Palatinate, told the Trierscher Volksfreund.","state of rhineland palatinate

Reuters Editorial,"Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to take assistance from the U.N. refugee agency for the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali said on Saturday.",2017-11-25T07:45:11Z,reuters,Bangladesh says agreed with Myanmar for UNHCR to assist Rohingya's return,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/sV2xPCy_HU4/bangladesh-says-agreed-with-myanmar-for-unhcr-to-assist-rohingyas-return-idUSKBN1DP05N,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171125&t=2&i=1211183038&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDAO04R,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to take help from the U.N. refugee agency to safely repatriate hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who had fled violence in Myanmar, Bangladesh said on Saturday.

More than 600,000 Rohingya sought sanctuary in Bangladesh after the military in mostly Buddhist Myanmar launched a brutal counter-insurgency operation in their villages across the northern parts of Rakhine State following attacks by Rohingya militants on an army base and police posts on Aug. 25.

Faced with a burgeoning humanitarian crisis, the two governments signed a pact on Thursday agreeing that the return of the Rohingya to Myanmar should start within two months.

Uncertainty over whether the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would have a role had prompted rights groups to insist that outside monitors were needed to safeguard the Rohingya’s return.

Addressing a news conference in Dhaka, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali gave assurances that the UNHCR would play some part.

“Both countries agreed to take help from the UNHCR in the Rohingya repatriation process,” Ali said. “Myanmar will take its assistance as per their requirement.”

The diplomatic breakthrough came just ahead of a visit by Pope Francis to Myanmar and Bangladesh from Nov. 26 to Dec. 2 that is aimed at promoting “reconciliation, forgiveness and peace”.

While the violence in Rakhine has mostly ceased, Rohingya have continued to stream out of Myanmar, saying they have largely lost access to sources of livelihood such as their farms, fisheries and markets.

Thousands of Rohingya, most of them old people, women and children, remain stranded on beaches near the border, waiting for a boat to take them to Bangladesh.

FROM CAMP TO CAMP

Ali said a joint working group, to be formed within three weeks, will fix the final terms to start the repatriation process.

After leaving the refugee camps in Bangladesh, Rohingya who opt to be voluntarily repatriated will be moved to camps in Myanmar, the minister said.

“Most houses were burnt down. Where they will live after going back? So, it is not possible to physically return to their homes,” Ali said.

Myanmar officials have said returnees will be moved to camps only temporarily while so-called “model villages” are constructed near their former homes.

Win Myat Aye, the minister for social welfare, relief and resettlement who heads a Myanmar government panel on rehabilitation in Rakhine, said India and China had offered to provide “modular houses” for returnees.

The U.N. and the United States have described the Myanmar military’s actions as “ethnic cleansing”, and rights groups have accused the security forces of committing atrocities, including mass rape, arson and killings.

The United States also warned it could impose sanctions on individuals responsible for alleged abuses.

Led by Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar is in the early stages of a transition to democracy after decades of military rule. But civilian government is less than two years old, and still shares power with the generals, who retain autonomy over matters of defense, security and borders.

The commander of Myanmar’s armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has denied that soldiers committed any atrocities.

On Friday he met China’s President Xi Jinping in Beijing having been told earlier in the week by a top Chinese general that China wanted stronger ties with Myanmar’s military.

Under the deal struck with Bangladesh, Myanmar agreed to take measures to see that the returnees will not be settled in temporary places for a long time.

Myanmar plans to issue them an identity card on their return, although most Rohingya have so far rejected a scheme to give them “national verification cards”.

While the agreement says Bangladesh would seek the U.N. refugee agency’s assistance on the process, Myanmar - which has largely blocked aid agencies from working in northern Rakhine since August - only agreed “that the services of the UNHCR could be drawn upon as needed and at the appropriate time”.

Win Myat Aye told Reuters on Saturday that Myanmar would discuss “technical assistance” with the UNHCR, but had not reached a formal agreement with the agency.

There were already hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh before the latest exodus, and the Bangladesh minister said they could also be considered for the repatriation, under the terms of the agreement.

The agreement, however, says they will be ”considered separately on the conclusion of the present agreement.”

Some independent estimates suggest there are still a few hundred thousand Rohingya remaining in Rakhine.","reuterssusana vera myanmar

Ingrid Lunden,"With Thanksgiving hitting a record $2.87 billion in online sales in the U.S., Black Friday is shaping up to be an even bigger haul for online retailers...",2017-11-24T19:24:30Z,techcrunch,"Black Friday deals net $640M in sales so far, mobile 60% of all traffic",https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/24/black-friday-deals-net-640m-in-sales-so-far-mobile-60-of-all-traffic/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-625744958.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The final figures for Black Friday online sales are in, and it’s another record-breaking day e-commerce in the U.S. Adobe says that shoppers spent $5.03 billion online in a race for bargains for themselves and to gift to others.

The figures come the day after Thanksgiving racked up a record $2.87 billion in online sales Adobe analyses 80 percent of online transactions to the 100 largest web retailers in the country to come up with its numbers. The final figure surpassed its own estimates, where were for $5 billion of sales.

“Shoppers capitalized on deep discounts on Black Friday, resulting in the largest Black Friday online ever,” said Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights. “Conversion rates across all devices saw double digit growth throughout Black Friday.”

Schreiner said that “Small Business Saturday” — the latest invented shopping holiday for the season — is seeing online sales “trending slightly lower than expected.” However, in a month of “exponential growth”, Cyber Monday is projected to be “the largest US online shopping day in history”, with an eye-watering $6.6 billion in sales.

Still, it’s a drop in the ocean for single-day sales when compared to Alibaba’s $25 billion in sales during Singles Day this year.

The final totals are a rise of 16.9 percent compared to Black Friday 2016, and also show that online sales slowed down slightly throughout the day. At 7am Pacific, when sales were at $640 million, they were up 18.4 percent compared to a year ago. This would make sense, since people flock to physical stores to catch bargains there as the day went on.

“Many retailers are still focused on in-store sales for Black Friday,” said Linda Bustos, director of merchant strategy at e-commerce platform provider Workarea (which also works with hundreds of online retailers). “The physical retailer’s star is still Black Friday, but the consumer behavior is smoothing out because consumers are opting out of the physical hustle and bustle and moving more toward what’s easier: shopping on a couch.”

While we are collectively seeing a larger volume of sales, on a per-sale level things are actually holding steady. The average order value was $135, which is up just 0.9 percent over 2016’s Black Friday average.

The bigger shift is in how we are shopping. Purchases made on mobile devices have so far totalled a record 36.9 percent of all sales, and 54.3 percent of all site visits. This works out to just under $2 billion in sales. Smartphones accounted for 44.6% of visits and 26.0% of revenue.

“The big story this holiday season is in mobile shopping. Retailers know this is where the audience is now and are delivering better experiences. On both Thanksgiving and Black Friday, the gap between mobile traffic and revenue is closing,” said Mickey Mericle, VP of marketing and customer insights at Adobe. “Shoppers looking for discounts are getting better at using smartphones to quickly close the deal, and we are seeing better mobile conversion this season at over ten percent growth.”

Tablets, and the story of their decline in importance in shopping — especially as smartphones have gotten faster, easier to use and bigger — is an interesting trend. It’s also been going on for a while now, and if you could use its performance in e-commerce as a track for how much they are used overall, the picture is not that bright for tablets.

Another stat that should not come to a surprise to those who are familiar with consumer behavior on mobile concerns the platforms that are being used. iOS average order value continues to be higher than Android order value, and is also growing more: respectively it’s $127 (up 5.1 percent on 2016) and $112 for Android (up 1.5 percent). iOS also has a higher conversion rate of visits to purchases: 3.2 percent (up 10 percent YoY) versus 3.1 percent (up 8.1 percent YoY).

Collectively, e-commerce has generated $33.26 billion in sales so far in November (up 17 percent year-on-year), Adobe said.

Black Friday — and the subsequent pool of days that has spread around it — are significant for consumers because they get a chance to buy items at a deep discount to their normal prices. (Unless you subscribe to the school of “Hey, if you don’t buy anything, you get a 100 percent discount!”)

They are significant for online retailers because they set the pace and are a bellwether for the rest of November and December, traditionally the most important time of the year for their businesses to rack up holiday sales.

In terms of what is being purchased, Adobe highlights electronics like TVs and computers as two big sellers today, as are the Chromecast and Roku. Other top products it said include Apple AirPods, the Sony Playstation VR, the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One X.

Updated with final Black Friday figures. We’ll add more as we find them.

This week it introduced two new forms of ads: Promoted Stories which string together multiple Snaps into a longer-form slideshows openable from a tile on the Stories page that’s shown to everyone in a given country, and Augmented Reality Trial ads that let people play with an AR version of a product overlaid on the world around them.

Together, these new formats could make Snap’s ads less skippable and more memorable, coaxing money out of businesses hoping to make a mark on premier audience of US teens. Both Promoted Stories and AR Trial ads go a step beyond what Facebook can offer, but could soon be copied like the rest of Snapchat.

Snapchat’s ads were predominantly either single Snap ads inserted between Stories or Discover content that could easily be skipped with a single tap, or sponsored creative tools that let you try on goofy masks or project 3D mascots into the world but that didn’t offer much utility. This may have left advertisers skeptical about the lasting impact on buying behavior.

“Our advertising partners have been asking for ways to tell deeper stories on mobile” Snap’s Director of Revenue Product Peter Sellis told TechCrunch in a statement. HBO is piloting the format with Promoted Stories about why you should stay in and watch Game Of Thrones on Black Friday, while in Europe clothing brand ASOS highlights “night-out worthy looks.”

Now advertisers can string together a series of three to ten photos and videos to create a Promoted Story that auto-advances or that users can tap through to follow a detailed narrative about a brand or see multiple angles of a product. They can look like a user Story or a mini magazine-esque Publish Story like what appears in Discover, and each Snap can be swiped up to open a website, app install, or article.

These Promoted Stories are labeled “ad”, get their own preview tile, and are purchased on a full-country one-day takeover basis with users having to actively tap to view. Advertisers get back a range of analytics from preview tile impression through to conversions. Snap says it can reach 88 million people in the US with Promoted Stories, surpassing the 74 million Instagram Stories users, and approaching half as many as Facebook’s 190 million mobile audience members. For the coveted youths age 13 to 24, Snap reaches 47 million people — supposedly 9 million more than Facebook and 15 million more than Instagram’s feed.

To avoid falling into the same pit as Twitter, with its highly-skippable and unobtrusive ads, Snapchat hopes Promoted Stories will ensnare users even if they instinctively try to click past an ad’s first Snap.

Meanwhile, AR Trial Ads take Snapchat’s World Lens ads and make them functional instead of just fun. Previous World Lens ads remade your reality into a creepy Stranger Things scene or let you stick a dancing Bud Light mascot in your videos. With AR Trial ads, BMW will let you actually place its new X2 vehicle in an augmented view of the space around you, tap to change its color, and walk around it like it’s actually there. The ads can also be swiped up to view a business’ website.

“We wanted to insert ourselves in an organic way into the Snapchat environment and its users’ world. That is the most meaningful way to address our fans in a style that fits the channel” head of Digital Marketing Jörg Poggenpohl wrote to TechCrunch in a statement. A previous BMW sponsored face lens ad in Europe reached 13 million Snapchatters who played with it for an average of 24 seconds.

That’s the magic of these AR ads. Even if you never share the content with friends, you still get extended exposure to the brand just playing with the selfie mask or 3D objects. Actually resizing and walking around a car company’s vehicle will probably leave a bigger impact than just scrolling past some Facebook News Feed display ad. If you reshare that content in private messages or Stories, BMW gets bonus exposure to people who see the brand enmeshed with their friends’ content so they don’t just skip past it like the banners we’ve all grown numb to.

Herein lies Snapchat’s challenge and opportunity. After bloodbath earnings calls and extremely weak user growth, Snap has to figure out how to squeeze more money out of the same number of people. It added just 4.5 million users last quarter, slipping below 3% user growth for the first time ever, down from 17% before Instagram Stories launched.

If it can’t reach the most users, it has to boost average revenue per user as high as possible without completely overwhelming the Snapchat experience with ads. These new formats are a smart way to do that because you’re never forced to watch them. You can choose to tap the Promoted Stories tiles or play with the AR tools.

By offering immersive experiences users choose to dive into rather than cramming light-touch ads down people’s throats, Snap could earn enough to stabilize its businesses and cut its losses. It can’t keep incinerating over $400 million a quarter and expect to have enough cash to develop a killer augmented reality hardware device before giants like Apple invade the market.","expectations

The best stores for Black Friday deals

Amazon

Amazon has our favorite online deals every Black Friday in the US, and that's just because it sells so many different items, and does so very cheaply in November. And November 2017 looks to be no different. It specializes in video game system bundles, so look for very cheap PS4 Slim and Xbox One S consoles. Sometimes it's a price drop, sometimes it's an extra game or controller packed in, and rarely it's both. We'll keep you updated on our Amazon Black Friday deals page.

Jet already has its Black Friday preview updated, and it's selling everything from the smaller Google Mini speaker with Google Assistant built in, to the new Playskool Tickle Me Elmo doll. Want a brand new 49-inch Samsung TV for under $650. There's a bargain here for you today, and there's way more where that came from, according to the Jet Black Friday early preview page.

Walmart

Walmart sells a little bit of everything, and because of its size, it's willingly to offer deep Black Friday discounts, or what it calls ""rollback prices."" That means you can get deals on everything from a new Apple iPhone to the latest must-have toys for kids in one quick shopping spree. We've highlighted some of this very deals below and on our Walmart Black Friday page.

Toys R Us

We have some good news and some bad news about Toys R Us. First the bad news is that the kid-focused retailer filed for bankruptcy in September. The good news, for you at least, is that it may be willing to offer massive discounts on everything from bikes to LEGOs to attract buyers. You can smell the discounts (and the desperation) over on our Toys R Us Black Friday deals list.

Newegg

Some of the best computer deals can be found at Newegg, where the retailer sells fully built laptops and desktops for cheaper than almost any other US store. It also specializes in components if you're looking to build your own PC. And, of course, it has accessories on sale. Basically, any nerdy gadget you can think of is on our Newegg Black Friday deals page.

Target

If there's one thing Target is known for on Black Friday, it's offering some of the best prices on Apple products, especially the iPad. Right now eBay has the best discount on an iPad Pro, but we're keeping a watchful eye on other tech discounts from this big US retail chain where more often than not, you walk in needing to buy one thing and walk out with a shopping cart full of stuff. Only a few more days to go on our Target Black Friday deals list.

eBay

We keep telling people every Black Friday that eBay is for more than just auctions. It often has the lowest prices on electronics throughout the holiday shopping season. 2017 will be no different, which is why you should pay close attention to our best ebay Black Friday deals page.","amazon lockscreen adsview deal iphone

Michelle Fitzsimmons,eBay has a huge Xbox One S deal for Black Friday,2017-11-23T13:01:50.326Z,techradar,eBay's Black Friday deal is the lowest Xbox One S price ever,http://www.techradar.com/black-friday/ebays-early-black-friday-deal-is-the-lowest-xbox-one-s-price-ever,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5r6UrezA7n4nofuKZan3pF-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Observers of Black Friday bargains will note the Xbox One S price has already dropped to its lowest price ever of $189 today, but eBay has an even bigger deal on Microsoft's console.

The Xbox One S is $169.99 on eBay right now, saving you an additional $20 from the deals you'll find everywhere else.

The console's standard retail price is $279.99, so you're really saving $110 if you go with this Black Friday deal versus any other time of the year.

Xbox One S 500GB is $169.99 right now

You'll be hard pressed to find a deal as good as this on the Xbox One S anywhere else right now. At $110 off MSRP, Microsoft's de facto Xbox can stream in 4K, play Xbox 360 games, and features a sleek design. It's also at its best price ever. View Deal

While not in the highest storage option of 1TB, the standard 500GB is good enough to house your games.

And the perks don't stop there. The Xbox One S can stream Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Video in 4K, and it can play older Xbox 360 games if you're looking for some throwback fun. We rated it highly in our review, and still hold the console that came before the Xbox One X in high regard.

If all of this sounds good to you and the price is right, we suggest making a move on the Xbox One S at eBay now before the deal expires on December 4 as supply could go quickly.","xbox

Matt Swider,Apple Watch 2 gets a price drop now that Watch 3 is out,2017-11-24T02:30:26.327Z,techradar,The best cheap Apple Watch deals Black Friday 2017,http://www.techradar.com/news/cheap-apple-watch-deals,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKTXYtm6ioRusese2zaznU-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Apple Watch deals have arrived just in time for Black Friday 2017, and here's our best tip: you can save money on the Apple Watch 2 over the new Apple Watch 3 version with LTE. The older models are surprisingly affordable now.

Finding an Apple Watch price drop isn't easy, however. The good news is that we're here to help you avoid paying full price for an Apple Watch 2 or whatever smartwatch you want to attach to your wrist. It all depends on where you shop.

Yes, the Apple Watch 3 is the best Apple Watch you can buy today; however, the refreshed Apple Watch Series 1 or 2 and older original Apple Watch are just as good for most people. Make sure you pick wisely.

28% off Apple Watch 2

This is the Apple Watch deal we like the most in the US. It's for the Apple Watch Series 2, and you won't even notice that's it's listed as factory refurbished with its ""looks and feels new"" tag.View Deal

Here’s a list of the best Apple Watch deals for November 2017, from the first version to the latest. We also threw in a few places to buy cheap Apple Watch bands at a discount that are cheap compared to the one Apple will sell you on.

Apple Watch Series 3

A modest upgrade

OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.65"" OLED | Processor: S3 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS Cellular

Now has an altimeter

Cellular options

More expensive versions have cellular features

Series 2 is arguably better value

The new regular Apple Watch 3 and Apple Watch 3 LTE delivers a really minimal upgrade, unliked the new iPhone X. The latter version essentially just adds in connectivity to its latest wearable. This basic Series 3 model though can only be called an incremental upgrade over the Apple Watch 2.

If you're not that bothered about being connected wherever you are - or don't want to pay extra for the capability - you might want to look at the older Apple Watch Series 2 deals below and save yourself some money.

Apple Watch 2 deals

Fitness takes over the Apple Watch

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

Water-resistant

GPS onboard

Expensive

Lack of useful apps

The Apple Watch 2 is the most expensive iPhone-compatible smartwatch you can own, and for good reason. It includes specs and features not available for the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1. This includes GPS tracking, a brighter screen and waterproof specs that allow you to wear it in the pool. All of that sounds great, until you see the expensive price tag, especially for the Ceramic Apple Watch 2. Aluminum cases make for the cheapest Apple Watch 2, followed by stainless steel and ceramic. There’s no gold model any more, but more intricate Apple Watch bands do lead to higher prices. In other words, you have to shop smartly when picking out your Apple Watch 2 below.

Apple Watch Nike Plus deals

The Nike-flavored Apple Watch 2

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: water-resistant IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

Water-resistant

GPS onboard

Limited fitness app

Not always accurate

The Apple Watch Nike Plus Edition is actually the newest Apple Watch 2, one that’s dressed in sporty colors like neon green along its perforated Sport Band. It’s brilliant looking. Yes, you can now buy the Apple Watch Nike Plus Edition bands separately, but you can't get the exclusive Nike running watch faces. The problem is this smartwatch is just as expensive as the Apple Watch 2 and less likely to see a price drop right away. Apple and Nike, after all, launched it a month after the Watch 2. There are places in which you can find a cheap Apple Watch Nike Plus, and places like Amazon that have third-party retailers jacking up the price on this sought-after Nike Apple Watch. Be careful out there.

Read our full review: Apple Watch Nike Plus

Apple Series 1 deals

The best Apple Watch for most non-runners

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S1P dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: splash-proof | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

The best Apple Watch for most people

Faster performance than Apple Watch 1

Lacks Series 2's bright screen

No GPS and not waterproof

The Apple Watch Series 1 is actually the best Apple Watch for most people who aren’t all-star runners and avid swimmers. It has most of the specs you need on a smartwatch. This is a refreshed Apple Watch compared to the original Apple Watch, so it has a faster dual-core processor and better battery life as a result. It runs all the same watchOS 3 software (and will be upgraded to WatchOS 4 this fall). Best of all, the much cheaper Apple Watch Series 1 price doesn’t leave out a whole lot. If you don’t need to track GPS runs and swim with it on, you’ll save money. The discounted Apple Watch Series 1 still comes in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm, but only has the more economical an aluminum case and Sport band. It’s the best Apple Watch value.

Original Apple Watch deals

The iPhone-tailored smartwatch merely a convenient gadget

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S1 System-in-Package (SiP) | Band sizes: Varies drastically per style | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

Cheapest Apple Watch now

Include heart-rate monitor

Noticeably slower performance

Battery life is one (waking) day

The cheapest Apple Watch on sale today is the original iWatch, the company’s first smartwatch that came out in April 2015. No, the Apple Store doesn’t sell this price-reduced Apple Watch 1 anymore, but there are plenty of retailers still hawking the original Apple Watch at a discount. The best part – besides the cheap Apple Watch 1 price – is the fact that it runs watchOS 3 with all the same apps as an Apple Watch 2. It’s a vast improvement over the launch software.

Apple Watch band/strap deals

Bands are not one-size-fits-all-budgets

Wide variety of sizes, colors and prices

Incredibly easy to slide onto your Watch

Can't use normal watch straps

Official Apple Watch bands are pricey

Your Apple Watch literally isn’t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.

In fact, you’re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don’t cut it at the fancy dinner table.

Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they’re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. Plus, you'll want to save up for the eventually Apple Watch 3.","nike plus apple series

Matt Swider,Cyber Monday deals have before November 27. Here's our list,2017-11-25T08:00:30.328Z,techradar,The best Cyber Monday 2017 deals: here's what's on sale early for Cyber Monday,http://www.techradar.com/news/cyber-monday-2017-deals,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvLrEFXMk9EFMrpP4rcP5W-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The best Cyber Monday 2017 deals have started today in the US at retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon and Target, hours in advance of the official date.

Cyber Monday 2017 is November 27, but the right time to buy everything that is in stock is right now because many of the top discounts are already available during this holiday shopping weekend.

Cyber Monday has become the online equivalent to Black Friday, only this special shopping day helps smaller retailers compete with larger retail giants, according to the small and medium business merchants we've interviewed. With more competition comes greater savings.

Our in-depth analysis of Cyber Monday predicts record-breaking online sales today through Monday evening, when Cyber Monday ends. Why? Because of price drops on 4KTVs from Samsung, LG and TCL, to name a few companies that are making Ultra HD and HDR televisions more affordable.

Cheap laptops are also a big contributor to early Cyber Monday, according to our early sales data. Everything from high-powered Alienware and Dell gaming rigs to cheap Chromebooks means you're within throwing distance of someone who will open up a laptop gift bought on Cyber Monday this year.

In the US, we're seeing high-volume PS4 Pro and Xbox One X deals, especially in the form of bundles. That contrasts with cheap PS4 Slim and Xbox One S consoles that are sold in game bundles and at their lowest prices as standalone units. Nintendo Switch and iPhone X deals only exist in that they're finally in stock at select retailers, while we have eBay links below SNES Classic Mini.

Below are the best Cyber Monday 2017 deals we've curated.

When is Cyber Monday 2017?

As we said at the top, Cyber Monday 2017 is November 27 this year. If you couldn't tell, that date is a Monday. It's always the Monday after Thanksgiving, which is also always the Monday after Black Friday.

The concept of Cyber Monday itself isn’t as old as Black Friday; the term “Cyber Monday” was first coined in 2004, but since then has become a huge deal on its own, expanding outside of its US origins.

The weekend of Black Friday and Cyber Monday isn’t just significant for sales - it also represents the beginning of the holiday shopping season. It usually helps to have some idea of your holiday shopping lists before the weekend so you can take full advantage of all the sales at your disposal.

However, deals come in hot and fast on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and you'll no doubt find great savings on tech and other items you didn't even know you wanted.

Cyber Monday 2017 predictions

Now that you have an idea of what's already on offer, you can probably imagine the amazing deals that will be available this year. From the latest phones to smart home devices to speakers and more, here are the best Cyber Monday 2017 deals we expect to see.

iPhone 8 and iPhone X deals

We can expect Cyber Monday 2017 to do for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X what Cyber Monday 2016 did for the iPhone 7. From mobile carriers offering BOGO deals or credits for installment plans to retailers chopping the price and tossing in freebies, there may not be a better time to buy the iPhone 8 or iPhone X. If you do see a sale, don't expect it to last long.

Apple Watch 3 deals

The iPhone 8 and iPhone X weren’t the only big announcements Apple had for us in September. It also introduced the Apple Watch 3, the first iteration to feature its own cellular connection. With a price tag of $399, getting to feel like Dick Tracy doesn’t come cheap. But you can rest assured that Cyber Monday 2017 will offer up discounts or deals to make the new smartwatch a far more compelling buy.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 deals

Android users won’t be left in the dark when Cyber Monday 2017 rolls around. Samsung already has shown the kinds of killer deals it’s willing to offer on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note, and those weren’t even during Cyber Monday. Expect big discounts, especially on the Galaxy S8, and free mobile accessories thrown in.

PS4 Pro deals

The latest and greatest version of Sony’s PlayStation is the PS4 Pro, and it’s expected to feature heavily in Cyber Monday 2017 sales. In fact, we’re all but sure it will be since during Cyber Monday 2016, we saw a ton of deals for its predecessor, the PS4 Slim. Most notably, PS4 Pro Cyber Monday deals will include can't-miss bundles, complete with controllers, accessories, and games.

Xbox One X deals

The Xbox One has undergone a transformation; Microsoft’s so-called Project Scorpio has been revealed as the Xbox One X, and it’s quite a console. Not only does it feature full 4K gaming, but it also already has a massive 22 games to play, including titles like Forza 7, Anthem, and more. At launch, the Xbox One X price is $500, but you can expect it to be a lot cheaper and bundled during Cyber Monday 2017.

Nintendo Switch deals

A bigger focus will be placed on Nintendo this year as the company has finally unveiled the Nintendo Switch console. The Switch features a ton of great games, including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but by the time Cyber Monday rolls around you can bet there will be a lot more ready to play, including Super Mario Odyssey. Expect some serious Nintendo Switch deals this year. The SNES Classic will likely pop up in deals as well, but you should expect it to go quick.

Everything with Amazon's Alexa smart assistant

Amazon loves putting its line of inexpensive Fire tablets on sale, and it has frequently dropped the price of its Echo and Echo Dot devices, all of which feature Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa. And given Amazon’s dominance of the online market place, you can safely bet that it’s going to put its products front and center on Cyber Monday 2017 with hot deals that make them hard to resist.

4K TV deals

Black Friday and Cyber Monday have traditionally been great times to buy TVs, and this year will be no different. From LG to Samsung to Toshiba, expect massive deals on the best TV technology. You’ll get huge discounts on 4K TVs, as well as lower-resolution TVs such as 1080p screens, so no matter how much you’re willing to spend there should be a TV set for you.

Camera deals

Cameras may not be as heavily featured as TVs on Cyber Monday, but that doesn’t mean they don’t see solid savings later in the year. DSLR cameras from the likes of Nikon and Canon, as well as GoPro cameras, will all get eye-catching discounts, namely through retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and more.

Laptop deals

If you’re looking for a new daily driver in terms of a computer, then Cyber Monday is a great time to go shopping. As we mentioned, last year there were lots of discounts on gaming laptops, but whether you’re into gaming or not you’ll be able to get a laptop for much cheaper than you otherwise would. That includes discounts on Apple’s range of MacBooks, including the MacBook Pro, standard MacBook, and more.

Headphone deals

From Beats to AKG, there are sure to be plenty of sweet savings on headphones. This year, the so-called “true wireless” form factor is a little more popular, so it’s expected we’ll see discounts on those headphones from the likes of Apple and Samsung. If you’re more into over-ear and on-ear headphones, you’ll still get access to plenty of discounts, so keep an eye on Amazon for those.

Cyber Monday 2017 FAQ

What is Cyber Monday?

Cyber Monday is the biggest day for online deals of the year. It’s the Monday immediately after Thanksgiving, and the day when retailers shift their attention away from sales in-store and towards sales online.

When is Cyber Monday?

This year, Cyber Monday falls on November 27. Black Friday is on November 24, and that’s the day after Thanksgiving, which is on November 23. Some deals may start at specific times on the day.

Where are the best Cyber Monday deals?

Cyber Monday deals happen all over the web, but the best place to stay on top of them is, of course, right here on TechRadar. We’ll be updating this page with new deals as we find them, and we’ll tell you whether the discounts are really worth it or if you should keep looking.

How do I get the best Cyber Monday deals?

There are plenty of things to keep in mind when you’re shopping for new deals. For starters, it’s best to make a list of things you actually want so you can avoid falling into sales traps during the day and buying products that give you buyer's remorse. It’s also a good idea to note beforehand how much you’re willing to spend as it’s easy to spend more than you otherwise might.

How do I stay safe while buying things on Cyber Monday?

We recommend always buying from companies that you know are legit. The likes of Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo Video, Walmart, Target and other big names like these are your best bet for safety online, but even then it’s a good idea to look into things like return policies.

Be very wary of phishing emails as these can be a big source of income for scammers during this busy shopping season. In fact, even if an email does appear legitimate we recommend going straight to the website offering the products rather than clicking on links in emails.","polk audio monitor40 series qii

Matt Swider,The definitive showdown between Xbox One and PS4,2017-11-20T19:35:00.323Z,techradar,PS4 vs Xbox One: which is better?,http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/ps4-vs-xbox-720-which-is-better-1127315,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZBtNrd2DSMVbqL7Luc98G9-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The Xbox One vs PS4 comparison is more important in 2017 than ever because both consoles are infinitely more powerful than the previous generation and both Sony and Microsoft tout their hardware as the absolute best.

[Update: the sales periods are now seeing some major reductions as well as some brilliant bundles with top notch games.

If you don't want to move to 4K - say you don't have a 4K TV yet - then you can get some truly astonishing packages and then, PS4 or Xbox, you won't regret your decision]

Who's right? Well, currently, there are two separate versions of both console: Sony has PS4 Pro and PS4 Slim, while Microsoft has the Xbox One X and Xbox One S. The PS4 Pro and Xbox One X represent the high-end 4K gaming, with the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S are a much better value for casual gamers.

Microsoft has the lead in the 4K gaming sphere with the powerful Xbox One X, but the PS4 Pro is more than competent enough to get the job done graphically. Additionally, Sony's console has a stronger stable of first-party exclusive games.

The PS4 vs Xbox One comparison all starts with the price and bundles.

PS4 vs Xbox One price comparison

The PS4 and Xbox One prices are constantly changing right now thanks to all of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2017 deals. We don't expect that to stop anytime soon. Here are the latest prices and bundles for each console.

The Xbox One X is clearly the newest console with few discount available, while the PS4 is now a year old, as of this month. It's seeing more discounts and gives you a bit more power than the PS4 Slim while still staying at a reasonable price.

If you want to dial back the cost of either console, check out the latest prices for the Xbox One S and PS4 Slim.

Additional reading Want to compare the slim consoles? Check out our guide to the PS4 Slim vs the Xbox One S. Want to compare 4K apples-to-4K apples? Our PS4 Pro vs Xbox One X guide will give you just that.

Look, we can sit here and mete out the differences between each iteration of the consoles, but we really don’t want to be here all day – so, instead we’re going to compare the entire ecosystem of each platform. If you want to really look into the fine details, we have you covered below. Don’t worry. And, don’t forget that Black Friday is coming soon, which you can bet will entail lots of deals on both consoles.

PS4 vs Xbox One sales

Both Sony and Microsoft have approached this generation completely differently – with Sony focusing entirely on games, and Microsoft focusing more on having the Xbox One as more of an all-around home theater device.

Sony took the lead this generation, according to VGChartz , selling an astounding 63 million units over the last 4 years – more than doubling Microsoft’s 30 million sales. A pretty big part of the reason that Sony dominated Microsoft was that focus that we mentioned earlier. They put all of their attention on building a great game library – and it’s paid off. Don’t write Microsoft off though, 30 million units is nothing to shake your head at, and with the recent release of the Xbox One X, they stand a pretty good chance of closing a bit of that gap.

Hardware Versions and Design

Both consoles are available in two different versions, one budget and one premium

The PS4 has a slim version and a 4K PS4 Pro

The Xbox has the Xbox One S and Xbox One X

Both the Xbox One and the PS4 have two separate hardware versions that you can buy right now. This is different than in the past, when each console existed on its own, and lasted an entire generation.

The Xbox One S improved on the design of the original Xbox One by cutting down a lot of the heft, and removing the gigantic power brick – instead opting for an internal power supply. It measures at just 11.6 x 8.9 x 2.5 inches and unlike the previous version includes a 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray player and can even upscale 1080p games to 4K, as long as you have a TV that can support it.

The Xbox One X might be heftier than the Xbox One S, but it’s still considerably smaller than the original Xbox One, measuring in at 11.81 x 9.44 x 2.36 inches and weighing around 8.4 lbs and also opted for an internal power supply. This is the high-powered version of the Xbox One, that allows for native 4K gaming and, much like the Xbox One S, includes a 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray player, something that not even the PS4 Pro can boast.

Our guide to the Xbox One X vs Xbox One S vs Xbox One will clue you in as to the differences in the Xbox family.

Then starting out the PS4 side of the equation, the PS4 Slim is straight up the smallest of the major consoles available right now, measuring in at 10.4 x 11.3 x 1.5 inches and serving as the baseline PS4 for most consumers, serving as a complete replacement for the original PS4. It doesn’t allow for even 4K video playback, but it can still play the entire killer PS4 game library.

The PS4 was the original 4K console, coming out an entire year before the Xbox One X – even if the ‘X’ eventually outpowered it. It measures in at 12.8 x 11.6 x 2.1 inches. While the PS4 Pro does to at least some extent support native 4K gaming, it doesn’t include a 4K Ultra-HD Blu-Ray Player, an omission that has caught Sony some flak over the last year or so.

Our guide to the PS4 Slim vs PS4 Pro outlines the differences between the consoles in more detail.

Xbox One is a monster console with lots of vents, but at least it won't overheat

Xbox One vs PS4 connectivity

You can't upgrade Xbox One's internal hard drive, but you can on the PS4.

Both consoles support the use of external hard drives.

The Xbox One has more ports on its rear.

Depending on how your gaming setup is organised, the connectivity of your console could be an extremely important detail.

Both the Xbox One S and X have identical ports, each including two HDMI ports, one for receiving an input from a cable or satellite box, and one that inputs to your TV. On top of those, they’ve each got two USB 3 ports, IR outputs, optical audio out, Ethernet ports and, of course, the power cable – which is compatible with both versions of the Xbox. However, due to the quick and tragic downfall of Kinect, if you want to use a Kinect with either version of the Xbox One you’ll have to go out and get an adapter.

The PS4 Pro and PS4 Slim have similar inputs, although they are slightly different. Each has a single HDMI out, a single USB port in the back (two in the front), an Ethernet port, and power. The only difference between the Pro and the Slim is that the Pro has an Optical Audio out, while the Slim drops it. One of the most compelling things about the connectivity of the PS4, however, is that both versions allow users to swap out the internal hard drive with one of their choice.

All versions of both the Xbox One and PS4 support 802.11 ac Wi-Fi and gigabit Ethernet. So no matter which console you decide on, you won’t have to worry about network compatibility.

PS4 vs Xbox One rear ports

PS4 and Xbox One are void of remarkable characteristics on the front. There's a Blu-ray/DVD combo drive to the left (which can play Ultra HD Blu-rays on the Xbox One S and Xbox One X) and their respective, muted-color logos to the right. PS4 has a pair of USB ports tucked between its sandwich-like halves next to where the disc drive is located.

Ali Breland,Critics are skeptical that companies will bring money back over the long term.,2017-11-25T18:01:54Z,the-hill,GOP bets that tax bill will unlock corporate cash overseas,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/361612-gop-bets-that-tax-bill-will-unlock-corporate-cash-overseas,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/applelogotaxstory_112217getty.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Republicans and major technology firms who support a tax overhaul have touted reforms that they say will bring offshore profits back into the country, boosting U.S. tax revenue and benefiting the economy.

But critics are skeptical of those claims, doubting that both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill give companies like Apple the incentive to bring money into the U.S. over the long term.

One of the central pieces of the Republican plan is a one-time lower rate on foreign income repatriated to the United States.

Under the House bill, foreign companies could pay a 7 percent rate on repatriated illiquid assets and a 14 rate on repatriated cash or assets that are easily convertible to cash, while the Senate rates would be 5 and 10 percent, respectively.

ADVERTISEMENT

The repatriation would be paired with a dramatic cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and a shift to a territorial tax system, two things corporations have long asked for.

Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyFBI informant gathered years of evidence on Russian push for US nuclear fuel deals, including Uranium One, memos show Klobuchar taking over Franken's sexual assault bill Lawyer: Kushner is 'the hero' in campaign emails regarding Russia MORE (R-Iowa), who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, said he believes the GOP’s tax reforms will not only bring earnings back onshore, but also attract “a lot of foreign investment” to the U.S. from overseas.

But Democrats and tax experts question why U.S. companies would continue bringing profits back to the U.S. once the lower rates for repatriation expire.

Sen. Tom Carper Thomas (Tom) Richard CarperDemocrats scramble to contain Franken fallout Pruitt to testify on EPA agenda at House, Senate hearings Senate confirms top air regulator at EPA MORE (D-Del.), another Finance Committee member, told The Hill repatriation is “a big one-time” fix that won’t stop companies from storing earnings offshore.

“It’s not a long-term solution to lowering the rates,” Carper said.

Republicans say that they’re not concerned, arguing that the permanently reduced corporate tax rate will keep corporate dollars flowing back home.

“I would think that everybody would want these companies to bring the money back here to hire more workers and create more jobs in America,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn John CornynGOP senator: ObamaCare fix could be in funding bill Senate GOP running out of options to stop Moore Texas Republicans slam White House over disaster relief request MORE (R-Texas) told reporters last Wednesday.

When pressed about what happens following repatriation, Cornyn said, “That’s where the 20 percent corporate rate comes in.”

Tax experts question whether the 20 percent rate will be enough to bring money back onshore. While the 20 percent rate is lower and more attractive to corporations than the current 35 percent rate, it’s still not lower than the single-digit corporate rates firms are currently able to pay using complex tax havens and accounting maneuvers.

As of 2015, Apple was able to pay a 2.3 percent tax rate on its offshore profits, by one estimate from liberal-leaning Citizens For Tax Justice. That rate is disputed, but most agree that the company’s tax rate generally sits somewhere in the single digits — far below the 20 percent they’d pay under the proposed system.

One additional incentive for tech companies under the Republican plan is a tax break on profits from intellectual property. That break will likely spur the return of some profits to the U.S., but Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, notes that “they can’t do that with all their [intellectual property], so they’ll keep some ... overseas.”

Lawmakers are also proposing a reduction of the tax credit on profits earned abroad, regardless of whether they’re brought home or not. Companies currently get a 100 percent tax credit on income earned abroad, which would fall to around an 88 to 90 percent credit under the legislation (the House and Senate versions differ). This would mean that companies would have to pay a 10 or 12 percent tax on overseas profits regardless of where the money is stored.

Despite this, “it’s still advantageous to book income overseas,” Toder noted while speaking with The Hill.

“Ten percent is still worth getting up and doing it,” agrees Marty Sullivan, an economist at the nonpartisan research group Tax Analysts. “There will still be profit shifting.”

“If one of these companies can make hundreds of millions of dollars by hiring a tax attorney for one million, they’re going to do it,” he added.

Even if repatriation does succeed in bringing back some corporate dollars stashed overseas, observers are skeptical that it will result in a giant windfall for the Treasury and the economy.

Their pessimism is rooted in the most recent test case that the U.S. has for repatriation: a 2004 repatriation tax holiday in which corporations were granted a temporary low 5.25 percent tax rate to bring income earned overseas stateside.

“If you look at 2004, when we tried carte blanche repatriation, it didn’t lead to more jobs. It lead to stock buybacks or paying out larger dividends,” Rep. Ro Khanna Rohit (Ro) KhannaCongress must end American support for Saudi war in Yemen House votes on US involvement in Yemen Monopoly critics decry ‘Amazon amendment’ MORE (D-Calif.) told The Hill. His district includes tech companies like Apple.

Researchers at the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2011 released an analysis finding that there were meager to nonexistent gains from the 2004 tax holiday. They cited National Bureau of Economic Research numbers that found a “$1 increase in repatriations was associated with a $0.60–$0.92 increase in payouts to shareholders,” but found no positive impact on job creation and domestic investment. In the analysis, they concluded that another similarly styled tax cut would not be advisable.

“The repatriation holiday would have little or no effect on investment and job creation, the key to the whole issue, simply because the repatriating companies are not capital-constrained today,” Heritage tax fellows Curtis Dubay and J.D. Foster wrote.

By capital-constrained, Dubay and Foster mean that large firms like Apple, Pepsi and Google already have large amounts of cash sitting in the U.S. that they’re not spending. Allowing them to bring in more cash more easily doesn’t give them a reason to boost domestic spending and investment.

Following the 2004 tax holiday, firms instead raised dividends, boosted executive compensation and increased buybacks of their shares which, when all else is equal, raises a company’s stock value.

“All that [repatriation is] going to do is lead to perhaps the appreciation of these companies’ share prices,” Khanna said.



“I don’t think that just having repatriation at a lower tax rate will have any linkages to investment in communities left behind or job creation,” Khanna added. “It’s going to do nothing in terms of creating jobs and prosperity for communities left behind.”","chuck grassley charles chuck ernest grassleyfbi

Sylvan Lane,"Senior White House officials insisted Saturday that President Trump is legally allowed to appoint an acting director for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is an independent agency.",2017-11-25T15:13:58Z,the-hill,White House: Trump has power to supercede consumer bureau chief appointment,http://thehill.com/policy/finance/361778-white-house-calls,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mulvaneymick_052417gn3_lead.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Senior White House officials insisted Saturday that President Trump is legally allowed to appoint an acting director for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is an independent agency.

Officials say Trump has the right to supersede an appointment by the exiting director.

The officials called Trump’s appointment of Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyCordray's legacy of consumer protection worth defending Mulvaney: Pass-through entities need to be addressed in tax reform Mulvaney: Accusations against Moore 'credible' MORE to lead the CFPB “a typical, routine move” in line with years of precedent.

ADVERTISEMENT

Trump appointed Mulvaney on Friday night to serve as acting director of the CFPB, hours before former Director Richard Cordray left the agency. Cordray promoted his chief of staff Leandra English to the deputy director position before leaving.

The conflicting appointments mean there are two people who can claim to be the acting director of one federal agency.

The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which established the CFPB, calls on the agency’s deputy director to serve as acting director until the president appoints and the Senate confirms a permanent replacement.

But senior administration officials said Saturday that the Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 empowers Trump to override the CFPB’s line of succession with his own pick. The officials spoke to reporters during a Saturday call under the condition of anonymity.

The Vacancies Act allows the president to appoint any Senate-confirmed officer as the acting director or secretary of a federal agency or department.

Legal experts say it’s unclear whether English or Mulvaney is the rightful director of the CFPB, but senior administration officials said years of precedent supported Trump’s decision.

One senior administration official said the CFPB’s line of succession “continues to be available as a default,"" but that “the Vacancies Act is also there as a way that the president can supersede the way those agency statutes work.”

“The common objections that you hear in these various blog posts online is that ‘Oh, the CFPB statue said the CFPB deputy director shall serve as the director,' ” said the official. “That’s clear in lots of these statues that the Vacancies Act trumps.”

The official said the White House consulted with the Office of Legal Counsel before nominating Mulvaney, and the office will likely release a brief supporting Trump’s move within the day.

The official also said the White House doesn’t expect any legal issues with Mulvaney’s appointment, and didn’t expect it to derail the agency’s work.

“I know it makes it a better story if things are unpleasant and there’s a clash of two directors, but I don’t think it’s [at] all clear that’s going to happen,” the official said. “I think there’s a very good chance that Director Mulvaney will come in on Monday morning and that will be end of things.”

Even so, the official accused Cordray of starting a legal battle ""we’ve gone out of our way to avoid.""

Despite the White House’ assurances, the dueling appointments have triggered widespread confusion among experts and concern among the CFPB’s regulated industries. Several groups aligned with Cordray's CFPB have insisted that Mulvaney step aside, while Trump's supporters have defended the president.

English, a senior CFPB employee, would likely continue the agency’s aggressive enforcement actions and sweeping lending rules. Mulvaney, a staunch conservative who once called the CFPB “a sick, sad joke” would likely freeze or significantly change the agency’s current agenda.

Mulvaney will also have to balance overseeing the CFPB while working with lawmakers to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling before the end of 2017. Failing to do so could risk a government shutdown or the United States defaulting on its debt.

The other administration official expressed no concerns that Mulvaney’s role at CFPB would detract from his responsibilities as OMB director. The official said Trump picked Mulvaney because of his work in Congress on the House Financial Services Committee, his budget experience and previous Senate confirmation.","mick mulvaney john mick michael mulvaneycordrays

Jonathan Easley,Conservative media outlets have been building an expansive case against Mueller.,2017-11-25T11:01:26Z,the-hill,Anger at Mueller burns hot on the right,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/361610-anger-at-mueller-burns-hot-on-the-right,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/muellerr05172017getty.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Anger at Robert Mueller is burning white-hot on the right and in conservative media, where calls for the special counsel to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election have reached a fever pitch.



President Trump has largely held his fire on Mueller, even as the probe into his campaign officials has intensified. White House lawyers are hopeful that the investigation will end soon and absolve the president and his inner circle of wrongdoing.



But the influential conservative media outlets that Trump is known to follow closely have been building an expansive case against Mueller.



From Fox News to Breitbart and talk radio, conservative media has been drawing attention to Mueller’s relationship with fired former FBI Director James Comey and his hiring of Democrats for his investigative team. They also argue Mueller has gone far beyond his mandate of investigating Russian interference in the election.



Conservative media has taken a new tack against Mueller in recent weeks, zeroing in on the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russia state-owned nuclear firm Rosatom.

Uranium One, at the time of the deal, held licenses for about 20 percent of America’s uranium production capacity. The sale was approved by nine members on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in 2010, while President Obama was in office. Mueller was the director of the FBI at the time.

But reporting by The Hill has shown that the FBI had knowledge of bribery and racketeering schemes at Tenex, a subsidiary of Rosatom, before CFIUS approved the deal.

Republican lawmakers critical of the deal have questioned whether the FBI shared that information with other members of CFIUS before it was approved — an aspect of the controversy that conservative media has seized upon.



“Robert Mueller, I hope you’re watching, you need to testify under oath,” Fox News host Sean Hannity said earlier this month. “Back in 2009, he was the FBI director, this was when the bureau, the FBI so clearly had this information. He has conflicts of interest. There is no way the American people can trust Robert Mueller to investigate anything Russia-related. For him to be fair and impartial is impossible because of his past role in this. He should resign immediately, tonight.”



The notion that Mueller’s investigation is compromised because of the Uranium One deal has caught on among some Republican lawmakers as well.



""These deeply troubling events took place when Mr. Mueller was the Director of the FBI,” Rep. Matt Gaetz Matthew (Matt) GaetzSessions defends Lynch's use of an email pseudonym: 'I have a pseudonym' GOP rep: Sessions had a 'come to Jesus moment' on Clinton special counsel Sessions grilled by lawmakers from both parties MORE (R-Fla.) wrote in a resolution demanding Mueller’s resignation earlier this month. “As such, his impartiality is hopelessly compromised. He must step down immediately.""



Trump has not directly tied Uranium One to Mueller, but the Obama-era deal is on his radar.

Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017

...the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia,.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017

Meanwhile, there is a steady drumbeat of allegations against Mueller building on the right.



The liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America released a study on Tuesday detailing 40 instances in which Hannity has called for Mueller to resign. Guests on Hannity's show have alleged that the special counsel has a “conflict of interest” 220 times, the study found.



The Wall Street Journal editorial board has echoed those calls, arguing that Mueller’s relationship with Comey complicates his investigation.



The paper's board has also questioned whether the FBI’s investigation of possible Trump campaign collusion used an unsubstantiated opposition research memo that was partially funded by Clinton and the Democrats.



“It is no slur against Mr. Mueller’s integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years,” the Journal wrote. “He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest.”



Many on the right also argue that Mueller’s indictments extend beyond the scope of his investigation because they don’t pertain to Russian collusion.



Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been indicted on a range of financial crimes. Little-known campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials, but not to charges related to campaign coordination.



Even the timing of Mueller’s indictments in late October provoked questions on the right.



“It is an odd coincidence that Mueller launched his indictments as he himself became a focus of public scrutiny,” wrote Breitbart’s Joel Pollack. “He may have felt pressure to justify the investigation by producing some results, however remote from his original mandate. Mueller may also have wanted to use the indictments to warn the president against probing too deeply into his own record. And, of course, Mueller may simply have been acting in a straightforward manner, without ulterior political motives.”



“But given the odd way Mueller was appointed, his refusal to resign, Rosenstein’s refusal to recuse himself, and Comey’s brazen leaks to the press, it is difficult to credit good faith to anyone involved,” Pollack wrote.

Democrats have beat back at the allegations against Mueller, arguing that his reputation is beyond reproach and that efforts to raise questions about his credibility are smear jobs by those who are fearful over what he might find.

Republican leaders in Congress have also defended Mueller's integrity.

""Remember, Bob Mueller is a Republican who was appointed by a Republican, who served in the Republican administration … and stayed on until his term ended,” Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanDem: Ex-lawmaker tried to pin me to elevator door and kiss me Two months later: Puerto Rico doesn’t have power, education or economy running again On Capitol Hill, few name names on sexual harassment MORE (R-Wis.) said earlier this year. “I don't think many people are saying Bob Mueller is a person who is a biased partisan.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellAlabama election has GOP racing against the clock McConnell PAC demands Moore return its money Klobuchar taking over Franken's sexual assault bill MORE (R-Ky.) has said there is no need to pass legislation protecting Mueller from being fired because there is no indication that Trump intends to do so.

“I think the view up here is, let him do his job,” McConnell said.","mitch mcconnell addison mitch mitchell mcconnellalabama

The New York Times reported Saturday that Kelly had floated the possibility of ousting Ivanka Trump and Kushner, both of whom serve as senior advisers to the president and play prominent roles in his administration.

""There was honestly never a time when I contemplated getting rid of Jared and Ivanka,” Kelly told the Times.

Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate heir, spent most of his first year in the White House under the spotlight. He was frequently seen with the president during meetings and at public appearances, and has had a vast portfolio of responsibilities.

But unlike his predecessor Reince Priebus, Kelly has sought to curb the free rein Kushner once enjoyed in the West Wing. According to the Times, the retired four-star general has asserted his authority over the president's son-in-law, who has more recently taken on a more behind-the-scenes role.

Kushner's allies say that his increasingly low-key role is a reflection of his success in helping to stabilize a White House once consumed by infighting and chaos. Without Priebus and former chief strategist Stephen Bannon in the picture, they say Kushner can focus more on his own projects and initiatives, according to the Times.

Kushner is still working on an effort to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians, and is focusing attention on the need to modernize the government's aging technology.

But his portfolio has been limited, the Times reported, and he is no longer seen as the unchecked right-hand man to the president that he once was.","john kelly john francis kellymore

“These people either do not believe the U.S. should be a world leader, or they’re utterly incompetent,” Dana Shell Smith told The New York Times. Smith was the ambassador to Qatar until she resigned in June.

“We’re here to stay,” Kushner told The Washington Post. “At the current moment, we’re charging forward.”

Kushner went on to say it was ""a good sign"" that Ivanka Trump had asked him if the family should look at new houses.

ADVERTISEMENT

The family, which hails from New York City, had originally agreed to reassess after the first six months of the administration whether they would stay in Washington, according to the Post.

Kushner's publicized comments come as The New York Times reported Saturday that White House chief of staff John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE discussed the possibility of Trump's eldest daughter and son-in-law departing the White House by the end of 2017, which Kelly disputed.

“There was honestly never a time when I contemplated getting rid of Jared and Ivanka,"" Kelly told the Times.

Kelly has reportedly limited the couple's access to the president since becoming chief of staff, having them go through him first.

Kushner has become a major subject of the continuing federal and congressional probes into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia's election meddling.

Special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly looking into Kushner's past contact with foreign officials as part of the probe.

Kushner participated in two meetings with Russians in the month prior to Trump's inauguration — one with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and another with Sergey Gorkov, the chairman of a state-owned Russian bank.

Trump nominated White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyCordray's legacy of consumer protection worth defending Mulvaney: Pass-through entities need to be addressed in tax reform Mulvaney: Accusations against Moore 'credible' MORE to serve as acting director of the CFPB on Friday following Director Richard Cordray’s resignation. The move is meant to prevent Cordray’s hand-picked temporary successor, Deputy Director Leandra English, from leading the CFPB until a permanent leader is sworn in.

White House officials insisted on Saturday that Trump has the authority to override the CFPB’s order of the succession.

ADVERTISEMENT

Prominent Democrats who’ve fiercely defended the CFPB under Cordray called Trump’s appointment of Mulvaney an illegal attempt to destroy the agency from within.

“The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a @CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. @realDonaldTrump can’t override that,"" tweeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenCordray's legacy of consumer protection worth defending Booker tries to find the right lane Jones raised 0K a day after first Moore accusers came forward: report MORE (D-Mass.), the CFPB’s architect.

“[Trump] can nominate the next @CFPB Director - but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act,” Warren added.

Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, called Mulvaney “an unacceptable candidate to lead the Consumer Bureau.”

""[Mulvaney] has not only expressed noxious views about the important work that the Consumer Bureau does to protect hardworking Americans, he has also worked to destroy it,” Waters said in statement.

While serving as a congressman before joining the Trump administration, Mulvaney sponsored bills to eliminate the CFPB and backed other legislation to put it under closer legislative oversight.

Waters also objected to Mulvaney serving as director of the Office of Management and Budget while leading the CFPB.

She expressed concerns that Mulvaney sitting on the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Financial Stability Oversight Council as the acting CFPB head would give the White House “an alarming degree of direct control over financial regulation, supervision, and enforcement.”

“It is inappropriate for Trump’s sitting Director of the Office of Management and Budget to simultaneously lead the Consumer Bureau, which is an independent agency,” Waters said.

Several groups aligned with Cordray's CFPB have also insisted that Mulvaney step aside.



The National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit focused on consumer rights, called Mulvaney’s appointment “an illegal affront to the American public.”

“In an attempt to install a wrecking ball at the helm of the consumer watchdog, President Trump has ignored the law that dictates that the consumer bureau’s deputy director takes over until Congress can confirm a new director,” said Lauren Saunders, the center's associate director.

Mike Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, called Mulvaney’s appointment “unlawful.”

“Leandra English is the rightful Acting Director of the Bureau,” Calhoun said. “Naming Mick Mulvaney — someone who’s adamantly anti-consumer — rewards financial predators and fails to put consumers first.”

The White House defended Trump’s appointment of Mulvaney on Saturday, insisting the Federal Vacancies Act empowers Trump to override the CFPB line of succession.

The Vacancies Act allows the president to appoint any Senate-confirmed official as acting director of an agency or department.

One senior administration official said the CFPB’s line of succession “continues to be available as a default,"" but that “the Vacancies Act is also there as a way that the president can supersede the way those agency statutes work.”



“The common objections that you hear in these various blog posts online is that ‘Oh, the CFPB statue said the CFPB deputy director shall serve as the director,' ” the official said. “That’s clear in lots of these statues that the Vacancies Act trumps.""","mick mulvaney john mick michael mulvaneycordrays

Devin Henry,Nebraska's approval of the Keystone XL pipeline was a key step in supporters’ years-long fight to build the controversial project.,2017-11-24T23:17:32Z,the-hill,Five things to watch in the new Keystone fight,http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/361618-five-things-to-watch-in-the-new-keystone-fight,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/keystonexl_112217getty.jpg,politics,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Nebraska's approval of the Keystone XL pipeline was a key step in supporters’ years-long fight to build the controversial project.

But the decision raised fresh questions about the future of the pipeline, which is still many regulatory and legal decisions away from the getting the final green light.

Here's what to watch as the debate over the $8 billion, 830,000-barrel-per-day Keystone XL pipeline moves forward.

Developers need more permits

Nebraska's decision Monday to approve the pipeline route was a landmark moment in the Keystone saga, but it’s not the final time regulators will decide the pipeline's fate.

The Bureau of Land Management needs to issue a permit allowing pipeline construction on a small swatch of federal land along its path, said Sierra Club senior attorney Doug Hayes. The Army Corps of Engineers also has to authorize its construction over waterways along the route.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Trump administration has aggressively supported the Keystone proposal, issuing a presidential permit in March allowing the pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canada border.

Moving Keystone forward is one of the first-year accomplishments President Trump most likes to bring up, raising the possibility developer TransCanada gets the final federal permits it requires.

Montana and South Dakota have previously issued permits allowing construction of the pipelines in their states. That made Nebraska a last-ditch spot for opponents of the project to influence regulators: officials held public meetings on the pipeline and considered 500,000 comments before approving the project.

Legal challenges are on the horizon

Opponents have tried to raise legal barriers to Keystone on both the state and federal level.

Tribes and landowners that oppose the pipeline are still suing over South Dakota’s decision to grant construction permits to developers. Their lawsuit is pending before that state's Supreme Court.

On the federal level, a coalition of environmental groups want the courts to reconsider Trump’s permitting decision, arguing the State Department relied on an outdated environmental review when issuing the cross-border permit.

A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a request from TransCanada and the Trump administration to dismiss that lawsuit, meaning the court is likely to review the State Department’s environmental assessment.

Nebraska’s decision is also subject to legal challenges, something opponents have promised to pursue.

The pipeline has a new route

A key question is how the route selected by the Nebraska Public Service Commission affects existing permits for the pipeline.

Nebraska commissioners did not approve TransCanada’s preferred route for Keystone XL, instead choosing a map that moves its route through the state eastward.

Opponents of the pipeline say that decision raises a host of questions about previous permitting decisions.

“It creates certain challenges on the state and federal level in terms of further environmental review, changes to the easements, and everything else,” Hayes said.

For one, greens hope federal courts will knock down the presidential permit because the new Nebraska route hasn’t gone through an environmental review. The State Department itself acknowledged this week that it’s reviewing the project.

“We have heard about a possible modified route, and we are in the process of gaining more precise information in order to determine if there will be any permitting impacts as a result of those changes,” a spokesperson said Monday.

TransCanada also has a big decision

Besides regulatory and legal deliberations, TransCanada is undertaking an economic one, as well.

Company officials have said they’re now reviewing whether there’s still enough of a demand for the pipeline to make it worth building.

“Overall, we expect support for the project to be substantially similar to that which existed when we first applied for the Keystone pipeline permit,” CEO Russ Girling said on an earnings call earlier this month.

“TransCanada and its shippers continue to believe that the U.S. Gulf Coast is the largest and most attractive market for growing volumes of Canadian heavy oil, and we also believe that the Keystone XL pipeline is the safest, most efficient and most environmentally sound way to move that crude oil from western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast.”

The company expects to conclude its economic analysis next month. Industry experts support the idea there is still a demand for the pipeline.

Zachary Rogers, an analyst for Woods McKenzie, said this week that the global oil market, including declining production in Mexico and political uncertainty in Venezuela, still makes Keystone a viable project.

“Nebraska's decision ... greatly diminishes the political risk for the project, likely clearing the way for increased volumes of West Canadian heavy crude to reach the Gulf Coast,” he wrote in an analysis.

Opponents are energized

Keystone XL has been a touchstone of the environmentalist and anti-fossil fuel movements for years, and many opponents of the project declared temporary victory when the Obama administration rejected it in 2015.

But Trump’s revival of the project and Nebraska’s approval of it have reignited popular opposition to the pipeline, with activists vowing to use public pressure and protests to prevent Keystone XL from going forward.

After Nebraska’s decision on Monday, a group of environmental and indigenous groups released a new plea, seeking volunteers to protest against Keystone along its route through the plains “likely next spring.”

That means the prospects are good for the type of massive protests that greens have deployed previously against Keystone and other controversial pipelines like Dakota Access.

The question this time is: How big will the protests be?

“We honestly don’t know if we can hold the line against Keystone XL forever,” organizers wrote in an open letter to would-be protesters.

“But we know that we have a chance, and that if we make a stand now it will improve our odds in a thousand other similar fights happening now and in the years ahead.”","nebraska public service commission

Over the past decade, most of its families have been spinning their wheels. The median household income, adjusted for inflation, has grown by just 1.5 percent ― $839 ― since the beginning of the Great Recession.

Over the same period, the total annual economic output of the United States has grown at 10 times that rate. The gains are even more impressive on the stock market, which has climbed about 40 percent (also adjusted for inflation). This is not due to the unique savvy of our investors. Business is just good. Corporate profits are booming, and the value of financial assets tied to those profits is booming along with them.

The experience of the past decade shows very clearly that trying to assuage the economic strains on the middle and working classes by pumping up Wall Street only helps people who already own a lot of financial capital. And people who already own a lot of financial capital don’t need help. Half of all gains from the sale of stocks and bonds accrue to households that make over $1 million a year. Less than one-fourth of American households own more than $25,000 in stock. And the 400 wealthiest households take about three-fourths of their very substantial annual incomes from financial investments.

So the tax legislation passed by House Republicans last week shouldn’t really be understood as economic policymaking in any traditional sense. It’s not about stimulating growth or investment or improving incentives. It’s class war. Republicans are assisting the efforts of a very small, very rich faction to take an ever-growing share of the nation’s wealth from the rest of us.

Republicans dialed up about $6 trillion worth of tax cuts. Senate rules require them to offset $4.5 trillion of that with new revenues, or face a Democratic filibuster that would kill the legislation. The tax cuts for the capital class blew a huge hole in their budget. The detritus they threw into that $6 trillion hole is, essentially, you.

A $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut would go straight to people who own stock in corporations. Another $696 billion would go toward repealing the alternative minimum tax ― a provision that is supposed to prevent the super-rich from paying no taxes at all. Another $596 billion tax cut would assist so-called “pass-through” entities ― hedge funds, investment vehicles, law firms and other things rich people use. Best of all is the repeal of the estate tax, which would enable millionaire and billionaire families to pass their fortunes on from generation to generation without ever having to pay taxes on financial assets.

Even the people who would benefit from these windfalls do not generally think it would encourage them to do anything productive. On Wednesday, Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Gerry Baker asked a crowd of CEOs whether they would increase their investments in new equipment or technology if the bill passed. Only a few raised their hands. “Why aren’t the other hands up?” asked an embarrassed Gary Cohn, President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser.

To realize these wonders for the 1 percent, Republicans have assembled a potpourri of problems for everyone else. The $47.5 billion they would strip from people paying student debt or attending graduate school would all but end post-collegiate education for anyone without a trust fund. By eliminating the deduction for state and local government taxes, Republicans would bleed municipalities and force cutbacks in public education and infrastructure. Local governments would get blasted again by the elimination of a $17.3 billion program to help refinance debt at lower interest rates, and the bill would strike a further $38.9 billion in financing to build hospitals, affordable housing and university buildings. They’d end a $54 billion tax credit for research into rare diseases. And a $300 million credit for businesses that comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. And the deduction for personal medical expenses. And credits for renewable energy.

The most outrageous revenue-raiser doesn’t actually stick it to the poor or the middle class. Republicans, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, would reap $293 billion from the “repatriated” earnings of corporations. This sounds like some kind of special tax, but it’s actually an accounting trick that rewards companies for stashing money offshore. The official tax rate on domestic profits for the biggest corporations is currently 35 percent. The GOP bill would slash that down to an ultra-low 20 percent. The repatriation clause would allow companies to pay a 14 percent rate on cash currently hoarded abroad for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax altogether. It would be another giveaway for people who own corporate stock. Only one class in the class war gets to count losses as profits.

This is why a substantial majority of households earning between $30,000 a year and $200,000 a year would face a tax increase under the legislation, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. But the political implications of the bill are far worse than its mathematical results.

Before he left office, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took special pleasure in pillorying the Koch brothers ― the longtime Republican donors who, with their various enterprises, aggressively lobby for right-wing political priorities on Capitol Hill and backed political candidates whom Reid opposed.

“They are in it to make money,” Reid once told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd. “That’s their whole goal here. To add zeroes to their billions.”



It wasn’t quite true. The Kochs do use politics to pad their pocketbooks, of course. They stand to make a fortune from the GOP tax bill. But like other billionaires, the Kochs love spending money. They fund cancer research and make enormous grants to universities, and smaller grants to individual artists and intellectuals. They pay huge sums to put their names on fancy buildings where prestigious things take place. There is the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., and the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center in New York, to name just two.

No, what the Republican donor class cannot tolerate is democratic accountability. They don’t want to see schools and hospitals going up just because people voted to build them. They want the priorities of American society to be organized according to the whims of our financial princelings, not the political will expressed by free people living in a democracy. You do not have a political right to fair treatment and a decent standard of living. You should instead feel gratitude for the benevolence of your overlords.","wednesday wall street journal editorinchief

The interview, which can be read in full here, touches on Gorka’s stint advising Trump on national security (Gorka left in August, following criticism over his anti-Islamist views and reported ties to a far-right Hungarian group), his political stances and his dim view of the media (hi!).

Since Recoil is focused on firearms, the piece included a large segment devoted to Gorka’s zest for guns and shooting. And there was one detail in particular that stood out and captured the interest of many folks on social media.

According to Recoil, Gorka’s “everyday carry” — meaning the items a person typically carries with them on a daily basis — includes two pistols, two flashlights, a knife, a tourniquet and a copy of the U.S. Constitution.

At 93 years and 166 days old, George H.W. Bush has now lived longer than any U.S. president to date, officially beating Gerald Ford’s record of 93 years and 165 days on Saturday.

Ford lived his long life between July 14, 1913 and Dec. 26, 2006, serving in office from 1974 to 1977 after Richard Nixon’s resignation. He died after a series of hospitalizations for heart treatments.

Bush entered the world on June 12, 1924, and served his term in the Oval Office between 1989 and 1993.

In recent years, he has used a wheelchair or motorized scooter. He was placed in intensive care at a Houston hospital for pneumonia shortly before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President Donald Trump, and could not attend.

Bush also suffers from vascular parkinsonism, which mimics Parkinson’s disease. Although he was discharged in time to flip the coin at the Super Bowl in February, he’s been hospitalized at least twice more since then.

Teen political blogger Gabe Fleisher brought attention to the milestone on Twitter on Saturday.

Milestone today: At 93 years and 166 days, @GeorgeHWBush becomes the longest-lived President in U.S. history, surpassing Gerald Ford. — Gabe Fleisher (@WakeUp2Politics) November 25, 2017

In the line of longest-lived presidents, Ronald Reagan comes in third, at 93 years and 120 days. He died in 2004 after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease.

Jimmy Carter comes in fourth, at 93 years and 56 days. Carter announced a cancer diagnosis in August 2015, saying he initially thought he had just weeks to live, but was declared cancer-free later that year.","hospitalizations

CAIRO (Reuters) - Gunmen who attacked a mosque on Friday in Egypt’s North Sinai brandished an Islamic State flag as they opened fire through doorways and windows, killing more than 300 worshippers, including two dozen children, officials said on Saturday.

No group has claimed responsibility, but Egyptian forces are battling a stubborn Islamic State affiliate in the region, one of the surviving branches of the militant group after it suffered defeats by U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria.

The assault on a mosque has stunned Egyptians, prompting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government to tighten security at places of worship and key buildings, and call three days of mourning for the bloodiest attack in Egypt’s modern history.

State news agency MENA said the death toll had risen to 305, including 27 children, and 128 people were injured.

Egypt’s public prosecutor’s office, citing interviews with wounded survivors as part of its investigation, linked Islamic State militants, also known as Daesh, to the attack on the Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, west of El-Arish city.

“The worshippers were taken by surprise by these elements,” the prosecutor said in a statement. “They numbered between 25 and 30, carrying the Daesh flag and took up positions in front of the mosque door and its 12 windows with automatic rifles.”

The gunmen, some wearing masks and military-style uniforms, had arrived in jeeps, surrounded the mosque and opened fire inside, sending panicked worshippers scrambling over each other to escape the carnage.

Witnesses had said gunmen set off a bomb at the end of Friday prayers and then opened fire as people tried to flee, shooting at ambulances and setting fire to cars to block roads. Images on state media showed bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the mosque.

“When the shooting began everyone was running, and everyone was bumping into one another,” Magdy Rezk, a wounded survivor, said from his hospital bed. “But I was able to make out masked men wearing military clothing.”

UTMOST FORCE

Striking a mosque would be a shift in tactics for the Sinai militants, who have previously attacked troops and police and more recently tried to spread their insurgency to the mainland by hitting Christian churches and pilgrims.

Local sources said some of the worshippers were Sufis, whom groups such as Islamic State consider targets because they revere saints and shrines, which for Islamists is tantamount to idolatry. Islamic State has targeted Sufi and Shi’ite Muslims in other countries like Iraq.

The jihadists in Egypt’s Sinai have also attacked local tribes and their militias for working with the army and police.

Sisi, a former armed forces commander who supporters see as a bulwark against Islamist militants, promised the “utmost force” against those responsible for Friday’s attack. Security has been a key reason for his supporters to back him, and he is expected to run for re-election next year.

(The Egyptian Presidency/Handout via REUTERS)

Egypt’s military carried out air strikes and raids overnight to target hideouts and vehicles involved in the attack, the army said, without giving details on the number of militants.

“What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism,” Sisi said on Friday.

The Sinai attack came as Sisi’s government looks to draw more foreign investment and finish an IMF reform program to help revive an economy that struggled through instability after the 2011 uprising ousted long-standing leader Hosni Mubarak.

North Sinai, a mostly desert area stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, has long been a security headache for Egypt and is a strategic region for Cairo because of its sensitive borders.

Local militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, once allied to al Qaeda, split from it and declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. But attacks in the Sinai worsened after 2013 when Sisi led the overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests against his rule.","bir alabed west of elarish city

Due to the “egregious” nature of the accusations against Rose, The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University issued a statement Friday revoking its Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism, which was bestowed on the host in 2015.

“This unprecedented action is taken with the utmost seriousness and deliberation. We are not in the business of trying to rewrite history,” the school’s dean, Christopher Callahan, said in a statement.

Although Callahan acknowledged that the gesture is “largely symbolic,” he hopes it sends a message that Rose’s reported behavior was “unacceptable.”

“The actions victimized young women much like those who make up the overwhelming majority of Cronkite students ― young women who deserve to enter workplaces that reward them for their hard work, intelligence and creativity and where they do not have to fear for their safety or dignity,” he said.

The second institution, the University of Kansas’ William Allen White School of Journalism and Mass Communications, also issued a statement on Friday to take back the National Citation it presented Rose earlier this year.

“William Allen White was an important journalist who also felt that it was important to make a positive difference in the community,” Dean Ann Brill said in a statement.

Rose hosted a longtime talk show on PBS and co-anchored “CBS This Morning” until reports of misbehavior began surfacing earlier this month as part of the #MeToo movement, which encourages men and women to share stories of sexual abuse.

The host stands accused of sexual misconduct by around a dozen women ― some of whom worked with him professionally. They say Rose made unwanted advances that included groping and walking in front of them naked.

In response, both CBS and PBS cut ties with the host last week.

Rose’s former “CBS This Morning” co-hosts Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell have spoken out about their former colleague’s behavior.

“This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and more generally the safety of women,” O’Donnell said last week. “Let me be very clear: There is no excuse for this alleged behavior. It is systematic and pervasive.”

King added that she was shocked by the allegations.

“What do you say, when someone that you deeply care about has done something that’s so horrible? How do you wrap your brain around that? I’m deeply rocked by this.”

In his response to the accusations, Rose “deeply apologized” in a statement.","dean christopher callahan

It’s a bureau that Mulvaney once derided as a “joke.”

It also sets up a battle over who has the right to name an interim director of the consumer agency: Trump or Obama-era banking regulator Richard Cordray, who announced he was leaving his post as the head of the CFPB by the end of the day Friday.

In a challenge to the president, Cordray named his own chief of staff Leandra English as deputy director of the agency before stepping down in a move seen as a strategy to protect the agency and thwart efforts by Trump to weaken CFPB, Politico reported. The deputy director is meant to serve as an interim head until a permanent head is confirmed, according to the Dodd-Frank Act, the legislation that created the agency in 2010 to help protect consumers from a repeat of the subprime mortgage debacle and other banking infractions.

In a note to his staff, Cordray said, “Upon my departure, [English] will become the acting Director pursuant to section 1011(b)(5) of the Dodd-Frank Act.”

Trump is using his powers under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act which allows a president to name someone already in the administration as a temporary director. The conflict could set up a lengthy legal battle over who can run the CFPB until a permanent head is confirmed.

Mulvaney will remain as head of OMB in addition to being interim head of the CFPB.

Republicans have long complained that the CFPB is too independent and too hard on the banking industry. The head of the agency serves for five years and can only be ousted for cause. In addition, the CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve and not Congress.

“The president looks forward to seeing Director Mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the CFPB’s dedicated staff, an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,” the White House said in a statement.

In his resignation letter Friday, Cordray said that the agency “has stood on the side of consumers to see that they are treated fairly, worked to improve their financial situations and held financial institutions accountable.” The CFPB was responsible for levying a $100 million fine against Wells Fargo last year after the bank created millions of fake accounts under consumers’ names.

According to rumors, Cordray, a Democrat, may be preparing to run for the governorship of Ohio, the Los Angeles Times reports.","doddfrank act” trump

British Transport Police believe the panic occurred after an “altercation” between two people on the train platform, HuffPost UK reported.

BTP noted that two men, ages 21 and 40, submitted to voluntary interviews as authorities continue their probe.

We appealed for information following an incident at Oxford Circus yesterday. Since the appeal two men, aged 21 and 40, attended a police station voluntarily and were interviewed. Thank you to everyone who helped to share the appeal. The investigation continues. — BTP (@BTP) November 25, 2017

Around 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday, armed police rushed to respond to multiple reports of shots fired in the area. Panicked commuters hurried out of the station and joined pedestrians seeking shelter in nearby shops, where police told them to stay put for safety.

Authorities were unable to find evidence of gunfire, however, prompting questions over what had sparked the commotion.

There were no casualties.

The London Ambulance Service said it treated and released seven patients at the scene for injuries they sustained while trying to evacuate the area. Eight additional people were taken to two hospitals for treatment of minor injuries, and another patient was sent to a trauma center for leg injuries.

An erroneous report from The Daily Mail suggested a truck had hit pedestrians. Meanwhile, anxious tweets from singer Olly Murs ― who has nearly 8 million Twitter followers and was in a nearby department store at the time ― also added to the confusion.

After about 90 minutes, London’s Metropolitan Police announced it was standing down the search, conducted alongside the BTP.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan thanked authorities for their “swift response.”

“It is extremely important that we all remain vigilant and don’t panic,” he continued. “It is vital that we are not complacent ― if in doubt it is always best to err on the side of caution and call the police on 999.”

Videos of the panic began cropping up on social media immediately on Friday.

“I was walking towards Oxford Street Station and Carnaby Street was just completely empty and everyone was hiding in the stores, no one knew what was going on,” one witness told HuffPost UK on Friday.

She continued: “And then all of a sudden we just saw a flood of people just running. So I quickly just ran into the closest Pret and to begin with everyone was calm but we suddenly just saw more people running down from Carnaby Street.”","london ambulance service

Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said.

Republicans and their supporters have been bashing the individual mandate so loudly and so vociferously that it’s easy to forget this outrage is a relatively recent phenomenon. Not so long ago, it was easy to find GOP officials and conservative intellectuals who supported the mandate, and not simply because they thought it was the smart thing to do. They also thought it was the right thing to do. In fact, they were the ones who first put the idea on the political agenda.

The story of how Republicans first came to this conclusion and then abandoned it is a pretty good parable for how the GOP has changed in the last 30 years. It also says a lot about the people who will suffer as their efforts to unwind the Affordable Care Act go forward.

The Mandate Was A Conservative Idea Originally

Most historians trace the mandate back to a 1989 paper by Stuart Butler, who at the time was director of domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation. This was a different era, when influential conservative policy thinkers endorsed universal coverage, at least in principle, but wanted to avoid straightforward expansions of government programs or new requirements that employers pay for insurance.

Butler’s proposal envisioned a fine for people who did not get insurance, along with generous new subsidies to make coverage more affordable. And the two went together for a reason: “This requirement would imply a compact between the U.S. government and its citizens,” Butler explained. “In return for the government’s accepting an obligation to devise a market-based system guaranteeing access to care and protecting all families from financial distress due to the cost of an illness, each individual must agree to obtain a minimum level of protection.”

Butler also wanted to avoid a “free rider” problem. Bound by professional ethics and law (the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act), doctors and hospitals would almost always provide care to uninsured people who needed it, Butler knew. But they would also pass the costs of that care onto the rest of society in the form of higher charges for paying customers ― unless, because of a mandate, everybody had insurance.

“If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance,” Butler said. “If we find that he has spent his money on other things rather than insurance, we may be angry but we will not deny him services ― even if that means more prudent citizens end up paying the tab. ...Each household has the obligation, to the extent it is able, to avoid placing demands on society by protecting itself.”

Butler’s call for a health insurance requirement did not generate much of a response at the time. The reality is that not many Republicans were even thinking about the subject in the late 1980s. But that changed a few years later, after Bill Clinton became president and focused on health care as his big domestic policy priority. Desperate to show they had an alternative that would achieve the same basic goals, 20 Republican senators co-sponsored a bill that included an individual mandate.

That represented nearly half of the GOP’s Senate caucus, as Avik Roy, now president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, later noted in Forbes. Among those Republican co-sponsors were Charles Grassley of Iowa and Orrin Hatch of Utah, both of whom are still in the Senate today. And it made sense, too, because Butler’s argument emphasized individual responsibility, as Republicans frequently do.

Republicans ultimately succeeded in blocking Clintoncare, and when they did interest in GOP universal coverage plans vanished almost as quickly as they’d appeared. But years later, in Massachusetts, then-Governor Mitt Romney, also a Republican, decided the mandate should be part of his state’s initiative to make coverage universal. He cited the very same logic Butler had ― in part, perhaps, because he’d worked with Heritage on crafting his plan. “It’s the ultimate conservative idea, which is that people have responsibility for their own care, and they don’t look to government to take [care] of them if they can afford to take care of themselves,” Romney said in 2005.

By this time, Democrats were also embracing the mandate, partly because they understood it would encourage healthy people to enroll ― and partly because they hoped that, by trying to pass a system with conservative elements, they could help secure Republican support for universal coverage in the future. For a short while it looked like the gambit might work. In 2009, as Congress was writing what would become the Affordable Care Act, Grassley told Fox News: “Everybody has some health insurance costs, and if you aren’t insured, there’s no free lunch, somebody else is paying for it. … I believe there is a bipartisan consensus to have an individual mandate.”

After Obama Embraced The Mandate, Republicans Rejected It

But then President Barack Obama, who had resisted calls for a full mandate during his presidential campaign, came around to the idea himself. And like everything else Obama touched, the idea became toxic on the right ― eventually attracting the ire of pretty much every leading Republican, including Hatch, who claimed he reconsidered after thinking through the constitutional issues.

A lawsuit challenging the mandate failed thanks to a narrow Supreme Court ruling in 2012, but Republicans never gave up their efforts to get rid of it. And now President Donald Trump has picked up the cause. If Congress won’t get rid of it through legislation, Trump has said, he will use his executive authority to undermine it.

So what explains the shift? For the likes of Hatch, motivated reasoning ― that is, adjusting policy beliefs to fit political situations ― seems like an obvious factor. As Ezra Klein observed in a 2012 New Yorker article, it’s simply not credible to think Republicans who spent two decades supporting or at least tolerating a policy suddenly decided, upon its enactment, that it violated the constitution. More likely, Republicans had committed themselves to opposing “Obamacare” no matter what (as subsequent reporting by journalists Steve Brill and Michael Grunwald confirmed) and these officials changed their positions.

But the ideological composition of the Republican Party has changed too, especially in the last few years. The logic of the mandate depends on a recognition that everybody will need health care at some point, because everybody can get sick or injured, and that society has some obligation to provide that care. That was Butler’s whole point ― and Romney and Grassley’s too.

These days it’s tough to find conservatives or Republicans willing to say the same thing. Not coincidentally, a common element in each Obamacare repeal proposal Republicans tried to pass this year was an effort to isolate people with serious medical problems, by undermining guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions. These bills also called for dramatic reductions in funding for insurance subsidies and for Medicaid. Had any of those measures become law, the financial burden for high medical bills would have fallen more squarely on the people who incur them, and less on society as a whole.

None of that is to say the mandate is sacrosanct or that serious people, particularly libertarians, can’t argue against it in good faith. The penalty really is a burden for some people, many of them lower- and middle-income. It’s also paternalistic, which is something that makes many conservatives genuinely uncomfortable. But it’s telling that, as these efforts to repeal the mandate move forward, only one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, is talking seriously about different policy mechanisms that could achieve the same basic goals of spreading the financial burden of illness and keeping a stable market for comprehensive coverage.","the

In her highest-profile international event yet, the first daughter is attending the three-day Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad, sponsored by the State Department and India, next week. A theme of the summit is female economic empowerment.

A senior State Department source told CNN that “no one higher than the deputy assistant secretary is allowed to participate” in the India trip. Tillerson’s staff “won’t send someone senior because they don’t want to bolster Ivanka,” the source said.

.@IvankaTrump will lead the U.S. delegation to India this fall, supporting women’s entrepreneurship globally.#GES2017 @narendramodi — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2017

Tillerson has a history of tension with the White House, and this could be the newest chapter. President Donald Trump has appeared to contradict his secretary of state a number of times. The president threatened to “destroy” North Korea in a speech before the United Nations, for example, while Tillerson was counseling diplomacy. Trump said Tillerson was “wasting his time” on North Korea.

Tillerson also reportedly called Trump a “moron” after a summer meeting at the Pentagon with members of Trump’s national security team and Cabinet officials, according to NBC. Tillerson never specifically denied he used the word. Instead, he said at a press conference: “I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that.”

Ivanka Trump’s participation in the summit is already controversial. Hyderabad has forcibly removed thousands of beggars from the streets, and even jailed many of them, ahead of her visit. In the U.S., critics also question her credentials as a promoter of women in business.

While the president touts “made in America” products, his daughter’s own fashions are manufactured exclusively in overseas factories paying low wages, The Washington Post has reported. A Post investigation also found that her company “lags behind many in the apparel industry in monitoring the treatment of the largely female workforce.”","north korea tillerson

Jared Kushner’s Vast Duties, and Visibility in White House, Shrink Image Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, is no longer seen as having a limitless portfolio of responsibilities in the White House. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times

WASHINGTON — At a senior staff meeting early in President Trump ’s tenure, Reince Priebus, then the White House chief of staff, posed a simple question to Jared Kushner: What would his newly created Office of American Innovation do?

Mr. Kushner brushed him off, according to people privy to the exchange. Given that he and his top lieutenants were paid little or nothing, Mr. Kushner asked, “What do you care?” He emphasized his point with an expletive.

“O.K.,” Mr. Priebus replied. “You do whatever you want.”

Few in the opening days of the Trump administration dared to challenge Mr. Kushner’s power to design his job or steer the direction of the White House as he saw fit. But 10 months after being given free rein to tackle everything from the federal government’s outdated technology to peace in the Middle East, the do-whatever-you-want stage of Mr. Kushner’s tenure is over.

Mr. Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, who had been in seemingly every meeting and every photograph, has lately disappeared from public view and, according to some colleagues, taken on a more proscribed role behind the scenes. He is still forging ahead on a plan to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians , a goal that has eluded presidents and diplomats for generations, and he has been credited with focusing attention on the government’s technological needs. But he is no longer seen as the primary presidential consigliere with the limitless portfolio .

The new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, has proved less permissive than his predecessor. A retired four-star general who has imposed more order on a chaotic White House since taking over in July, Mr. Kelly has made clear that Mr. Kushner must fit within a chain of command. “Jared works for me,” he has told associates. According to three advisers to the president, Mr. Kelly has even discussed the possibility of Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, departing the West Wing by the end of the year.

Mr. Kelly disputed that in an interview on Friday. “There was honestly never a time when I contemplated getting rid of Jared and Ivanka,” Mr. Kelly said. He also said the Office of American Innovation, run by Mr. Kushner, had demonstrated its value, noting that he had recently sent some members of its team to Puerto Rico to report back on conditions on the hurricane-ravaged island.

And in an email forwarded by the White House, the president said on Friday that he still relied on Mr. Kushner. “Jared is working very hard on peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and the last thing I would ever do is get in the way of that possibility,” Mr. Trump said. “Jared has been very effective since the earliest days of the campaign and the same is true today. He understood the movement then and has been helpful implementing the agenda the American people voted for since.”

Determining anyone’s place in Mr. Trump’s orbit, of course, is a hazardous exercise. The president’s affections are fickle, and he tends to keep relationships open even if they are strained. At one point, Mr. Trump is said to depend less on Mr. Kushner, and the next he checks in with his son-in-law about the Roy Moore Senate race in Alabama to gauge his own potential reactions , according to one person familiar with the conversations.

But even Mr. Kushner’s supporters acknowledged that his role had evolved. In their view, that reflected his success, not failure. By helping to push out Mr. Priebus and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist and acerbic nationalist infighter, they said, Mr. Kushner helped stabilize the White House, allowing him to focus on his own projects rather than feeling compelled to weigh in on so many different issues.

In the first months of the administration, Mr. Kushner typically would spend five or six hours a day with the president in what his advocates described as playing defense, making sure others were not gaming the system by persuading Mr. Trump to make decisions without consulting others who had interest in the issues. Now under a less freewheeling system, Mr. Kushner and other aides are expected to stay in their own lanes.

Critics take a less generous view. Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist, said the “magical powers” ascribed to Mr. Kushner early on seemed to have faded. “As long as Jared was seen and not heard, he was able to play the role of wonder boy,” he said. “But now he is no longer seen, and we are only left to wonder about the boy whose father-in-law placed the hope of unraveling the world’s most intractable public policy puzzles from peace in the Middle East to reinventing government” in him.

Speculation about Mr. Kushner’s role comes as the long shadow of the special counsel’s investigation darkens the White House. Investigators have asked witnesses about Mr. Kushner’s foreign policy role during the campaign and the presidential transition, including his involvement in a debate over a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel’s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank, as The Wall Street Journal has reported .

One person familiar with the questioning, who asked not to be identified discussing the investigation, said the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, appeared to be exploring Mr. Kushner’s role as part of his examination of Michael T. Flynn, who went on to become Mr. Trump’s national security adviser before being forced out after 24 days for not being forthcoming about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador.

Mr. Kushner has yet to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller’s team. Worried that his conversations might have been picked up on a government-authorized wiretap or perhaps by Russia or China, Mr. Kushner has become increasingly cautious about how he communicates, even with friends.

The scrutiny by Mr. Mueller upended Mr. Kushner’s initial hopes, according to some colleagues. Mr. Kushner expressed relief over Mr. Mueller’s appointment in May, assuming that the prosecutor’s inquiry would effectively freeze congressional investigations and therefore free up the White House to pursue its legislative agenda.

To some, that suggested he did not get it, that he did not fully grasp how the special counsel would scrutinize every single thing he had done in business, during the transition and during the campaign. And the emergence of Mr. Mueller has not halted the House or Senate inquiries; Mr. Kushner has since been interviewed by congressional investigators.

Some friends said Mr. Kushner and his wife were at times so discouraged by their brief White House careers — and their shrinking social circle — that they would leap at a chance to gracefully return to New York. At one point this fall, a scenario circulated in which Ms. Trump could replace Nikki R. Haley as ambassador to the United Nations if Ms. Haley replaced Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. (Aides to Mr. Trump said they never heard that discussed internally, and the latest betting now has Ms. Haley staying put.)

Others in the couple’s orbit, however, said that whatever their frustrations, they have found more satisfaction in recent months now that Mr. Bannon is no longer inside the West Wing fighting them, and that they are likelier to stay for the foreseeable future. Mr. Kushner’s father, Charles, has urged his son to hang on, arguing that otherwise he will become the fall guy for White House mistakes, according to someone in Jared Kushner’s circle.

“Jared’s role working for President Trump is just as important as it was Day 1, only now he doesn’t have to worry about babysitting others,” said Jason Miller, a campaign adviser who remains close to the White House. “His focus was always supposed to be the president’s big-picture, long-term projects, and now Jared can work on those uninterrupted.”

New York is not exactly a trouble-free zone for Mr. Kushner either. He would presumably resume running his family’s real estate empire, now struggling to save its crown jewel, a Manhattan skyscraper. The building at 666 Fifth Avenue is awash in $1.2 billion in debt , and a key business partner recently declared that a redevelopment plan created by Mr. Kushner before he joined the government is unfeasible.

Mr. Kushner arrived in the White House with an expansive portfolio. In addition to Middle East peace, he served as the president’s intermediary with Mexico , China and the Arab world. He traveled to Iraq wearing a flak vest over his blue blazer and button-down shirt. His high profile generated magazine covers and late-night comic riffs. Even some inside the West Wing began referring to him as “the secretary of state.”

In the early months, Mr. Kushner brokered a tense telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mexico’s president and arranged a summit meeting with President Xi Jinping of China that transformed his father-in-law’s approach toward Beijing. He organized Mr. Trump’s first overseas trip with an opening stop in Saudi Arabia , where the president aligned himself with Sunni Arabs confronting Iran .

Mr. Kushner has since stepped back from the China relationship. He joined Mr. Trump in Beijing this month but did not accompany the president on his entire Asia trip. He remains the point person with Saudi Arabia, where he recently visited and talked late into the night with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He is also working with the team renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and developing a plan to overhaul re-entry into American society for prisoners.

But Mr. Kushner, new to government, has found it confounding at times. And Mr. Priebus’s early question about the mandate of Mr. Kushner’s innovation office was never fully resolved. Sometimes called “Jared’s island” by White House aides, it has remained a jumble of seemingly random projects, ranging from addressing the nation’s opioid crisis and infrastructure needs to trying to modernize the government’s antiquated computer systems.

Corporate leaders were recruited to give input at round-table discussions organized by Mr. Kushner. But by last summer, some executives were fed up with talk-a-thons. They complained to Gary D. Cohn, the president’s national economic adviser, who in turn told Mr. Kushner’s aides not to convene another listening session unless it had a compelling purpose and produced results.

Two White House councils of business leaders were disbanded in August after an exodus of members upset with the president’s failure to more forcefully condemn violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.

Other initiatives backed by Mr. Kushner have proved more fruitful. Congress appears to be on the verge of creating a $500 million fund to help agencies modernize outdated information technology systems, some of which are at least 40 years old.

With Mr. Kushner’s support, the Department of Veterans Affairs also developed a plan to erase a longstanding electronic gap between the medical records of service members and veterans that has hurt patient care for years.

But Mr. Kushner’s push for technological advances is hobbled by a lack of permanent officials to carry out policy changes at the agency level. The White House has failed to name chief information officers for nine major agencies, including Defense, Treasury and Homeland Security. Even the federal chief information officer is only an acting official, and the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy is largely a ghost town.

The innovation office is providing political cover and “a push from the top,” said Max Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that analyzes the effectiveness of the government. “But at the end of the day, what the White House does doesn’t matter if it doesn’t get implemented at the agencies where the real action takes place.”

Gardiner Harris,A State Department exodus marks a new stage in the broken and increasingly contentious relationship between Rex W. Tillerson and much of his work force.,2017-11-25T02:42:16Z,the-new-york-times,Diplomats Sound the Alarm as They Are Pushed Out in Droves,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/us/politics/state-department-tillerson.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/25/us/25dc-state/-24dc-state-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Now the estrangement is in the open, as diplomats going out the door make their feelings known and members of Congress raise questions about the impact of their leaving.

In a letter to Mr. Tillerson last week, Democratic members of the House Foreign Relations Committee, citing what they said was “the exodus of more than 100 senior Foreign Service officers from the State Department since January,” expressed concern about “what appears to be the intentional hollowing-out of our senior diplomatic ranks.”

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, sent a similar letter, telling Mr. Tillerson that “America’s diplomatic power is being weakened internally as complex global crises are growing externally.”

Mr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has made no secret of his belief that the State Department is a bloated bureaucracy and that he regards much of the day-to-day diplomacy that lower-level officials conduct as unproductive. Even before Mr. Tillerson was confirmed, his staff fired six of the State Department’s top career diplomats, including Patrick Kennedy, who had been appointed to his position by President George W. Bush. Kristie Kenney, the department’s counselor and one of just five career ambassadors, was summarily fired a few weeks later.

None were given any reason for their dismissals, although Mr. Kennedy and Ms. Kenney had been reprimanded by Trump transition officials for answering basic logistical questions from Nikki R. Haley, President Trump’s pick as United Nations ambassador. Mr. Tillerson is widely believed to dislike Ms. Haley, who has been seen as a possible successor if Mr. Tillerson steps down.

In the following months, Mr. Tillerson launched a reorganization that he has said will be the most important thing he will do, and he has hired two consulting companies to lead the effort. Since he decided before even arriving at the State Department to slash its budget by 31 percent, many in the department have always seen the reorganization as a smoke screen for drastic cuts.

Mr. Tillerson has frozen most hiring and recently offered a $25,000 buyout in hopes of pushing nearly 2,000 career diplomats and civil servants to leave by October 2018.

His small cadre of aides have fired some diplomats and gotten others to resign by refusing them the assignments they wanted or taking away their duties altogether. Among those fired or sidelined were most of the top African-American and Latino diplomats, as well as many women, difficult losses in a department that has long struggled with diversity.

One of them was Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career Foreign Service officer who served as ambassador to Liberia under Mr. Bush and as director general of the Foreign Service and assistant secretary for African Affairs during the Obama administration. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield was among those asked to leave by Mr. Tillerson’s staff, but she appealed and remained until her retirement in September.

“I don’t feel targeted as an African-American,” she said. “I feel targeted as a professional.”

For those who have not been dismissed, retirement has become a preferred alternative when, like Mr. Miller, they find no demand for their expertise. A retirement class that concludes this month has 26 senior employees, including two acting assistant secretaries in their early 50s who would normally wait years before leaving.

The number of those with the department’s top two ranks of career ambassador and career minister — equivalent to four- and three-star generals — will have been cut in half by Dec. 1, from 39 to 19. And of the 431 minister-counselors, who have two-star-equivalent ranks, 369 remain and another 14 have indicated that they will leave soon — an 18 percent drop — according to an accounting provided by the American Foreign Service Association.

The political appointees who normally join the department after a change in administration have not made up for those departures. So far, just 10 of the top 44 political positions in the department have been filled, and for most of the vacancies, Mr. Tillerson has not nominated anyone.

“Leadership matters,” said Nancy McEldowney, a former ambassador who retired in June after a 30-year career as a Foreign Service officer. “There’s a vacuum throughout the State Department, and the junior people now working in these top jobs lack the confidence and credibility that comes from a presidential nomination and Senate confirmation.”

Even more departures are expected as a result of an intense campaign that Mr. Tillerson has ordered to reduce the department’s longtime backlog of Freedom of Information Act requests. CNN reported that the task had resulted from Mr. Trump’s desire to accelerate the release of Mrs. Clinton’s remaining emails.

Every bureau in the department has been asked to contribute to the effort. That has left midlevel employees and diplomats — including some just returning from high-level or difficult overseas assignments — to spend months performing mind-numbing clerical functions beside unpaid interns.

Mr. Tillerson’s spokesman, R. C. Hammond, dismissed any suggestion that the departures had had a negative effect.

“There are qualified people who are delivering on America’s diplomatic mission,” Mr. Hammond said. “It’s insulting to them every time someone comes up to them and says that the State Department is being gutted.”

Former State Department officials disagree.

“The United States is at the center of every crisis around the world, and you simply cannot be effective if you don’t have assistant secretaries and ambassadors in place,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat who was an under secretary of state for President George W. Bush. “It shows a disdain for diplomacy.”

One result is that there is no one in place with responsibilities for some key trouble spots.

Although the North Korean nuclear crisis is the Trump administration’s top priority, the administration has yet to nominate an assistant secretary for East Asia or an ambassador to South Korea, crucial positions to deal with the issue.

In the midst of the war in Syria and growing worries over a possible conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, there is no confirmed assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs or ambassadors to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt or Qatar. And as Zimbabwe confronts the future after the departure of Robert Mugabe, the department is lacking a confirmed assistant secretary for African affairs or an ambassador to neighboring South Africa.

And the department’s future effectiveness may also be threatened. As more senior officials depart, interest in joining the Foreign Service is dwindling. With fewer prospects for rewarding careers, the number of people taking its entrance exam is on track to drop by 50 percent this year, according to the Foreign Service Association.

“The message from the State Department right now is, ‘We don’t want you,’ and students are hearing that,” said James Goldgeier, former dean of the School of International Service at American University.

For many at the State Department, their experience under Mr. Tillerson has been a particular shock because their hopes for him were initially high.

Mrs. Clinton and John Kerry, her successor, were both seen as focused on their own priorities and were not particularly popular within the department. The model secretaries in recent history have been Colin Powell, James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz, Republicans who cared about management.

“Everyone who called me, I said: ‘Listen, guys, this is going to be great, and maybe he’ll finally get the department in shape,’” said Dana Shell Smith, the ambassador to Qatar, who recently resigned.

Since then, Ms. Smith has changed her mind.

“These people either do not believe the U.S. should be a world leader, or they’re utterly incompetent,” she said. “Either way, having so many vacancies in essential places is a disaster waiting to happen.”","backlog of freedom of information act requests cnn

Michael Wines,"At a time when gaming election rules has become standard political strategy, the once-mundane task of culling voter rolls takes on new importance.",2017-11-25T16:24:45Z,the-new-york-times,Culling Voter Rolls: Deciding Who Even Gets to Go to the Polls,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/us/voter-rolls-registration-culling-election.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/26/us/26purge-01/00purge-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Conservative groups and Republican election officials in some states say the poorly maintained rolls invite fraud and meddling by hackers, sap public confidence in elections and make election workers’ jobs harder. Voting rights advocates and most Democratic election officials, in turn, say that the benefits are mostly imaginary, and that the purges are intended to reduce the number of minority, poor and young voters, who are disproportionately Democrats.

“The goal here is not election integrity,” Stuart Naifeh, the senior counsel at the voting rights group Demos, said. “It’s intimidation and suppression of voters.”

On Wednesday, Demos and two other advocacy groups, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School, offered legal help to any of the 248 county election officials who tried to oppose the notice.

The author of the notice to county officials, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, responded quickly. “It seems like we’ve arrived to the point where asking election officials to do what the law requires makes P.I.L.F. subversive,” the group’s president, J. Christian Adams, said in a statement.

Mr. Adams is among several conservatives appointed by President Trump to the White House’s Advisory Commission on Voter Integrity, the voter fraud panel mired in a partisan feud over its operations and political intentions.

The Public Interest Legal Foundation is one of four conservative advocacy groups that have pursued often-overlapping campaigns to purge voter rolls. Three of the groups — the foundation, Judicial Watch and the American Civil Rights Union — rely on former lawyers in the Justice Department’s civil rights division during the George W. Bush administration. The fourth, True the Vote, is an offshoot of a Tea Party group based in Houston.

The groups argue that election officials are ignoring a requirement in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 that a “reasonable effort” be made to cull ineligible voters — the dead, people who have moved, noncitizens and felons whose voting rights are restricted.

A spokesman for the Public Interest Legal Foundation, Logan Churchwell, said election officials were hobbled by a lack of money and “a failure of imagination.” The law sets few boundaries on tending lists, largely requiring that officials keep voters on the rolls for up to two general elections if they cannot confirm that they have moved. The most explicit prohibitions outlaw striking voters simply because they have not cast ballots and ban delistings within 90 days of elections.

Mr. Churchwell said that too many election officials rely on the mail to determine whether people have moved, depending on voters to return postage-paid confirmation requests sent to their last known address. Voters who lose or fail to return them — or sometimes, never get them — are left on the rolls. The 1993 law, he said, did not anticipate a digital world in which the dead and other ineligible voters can be identified more quickly and perhaps more cheaply.

Example one, he said, is Broward County, Fla., where arguments in a federal lawsuit against the county election supervisor ended this summer. Mr. Churchwell said the foundation discovered three people on the rolls who were alive when Grover Cleveland was president in the 1890s. Election officials “wait for a death certificate to show up and drop in their laps,” he said.

Brenda Snipes, the Broward elections supervisor, said the county followed the same procedures as Florida’s other 66 counties in managing voter rolls. “The court record shows thousands and thousands of people that were purged during the time they expressed concern,” she said.

Broward has a regimen for verifying the status of centenarians, she said, “but you can’t just suspect that a person may be dead or moved away and remove them from the rolls.”

Election officials routinely cull their rolls, but delisting is an exercise fraught with error. Registrants who die in other states — say, New Yorkers who winter in Florida — may pass unnoticed in the states where they are registered.

Officials do tap databases kept by state vital records agencies, the Social Security Administration and the Postal Service, which has a change-of-address list. But the databases cannot assure matches; some jurisdictions do not collect personal information like Social Security or driver’s license numbers that could make a positive ID easier.

And the databases themselves have flaws and anomalies. Voters with similar or identical names compound the odds of accidental delisting. A University of Pennsylvania study of 125 million voter registration files from 2012 found that some three million registrants shared a common first name, last name and date of birth. And registrants from groups where a few surnames are commonly used are especially vulnerable to being mistakenly struck from the rolls.

Add to that the vagaries of human error and habit. Clerks make mistakes while typing registration information into computers.

“Elected officials, both Democratic and Republican, recognize the value of good list maintenance,” said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, which tackles election administration problems. “But being absolutely sure that person on the list of deceased you were given is the same person on your voter list? That becomes very difficult.”

Voting rights groups say the question is not what constitutes a reasonable effort, but what sorts of efforts are unreasonable. And they point to a case now before the Supreme Court as proof of what aggressive purges really accomplish.

In that suit, Ohio officials disenfranchised thousands of eligible voters by requiring all voters who skipped a single election to return a postage-paid form stating whether they had moved. Those who failed to return the form were delisted if they did not vote in the next two elections, even if they were legally still eligible.

The Supreme Court, which will hear the case in January, will decide whether the purge violated the Voter Registration Act’s near-total ban on removing registrants because they do not vote. Three of the four conservative advocacy groups have filed briefs supporting Ohio’s purging methods.

“The right to vote is too important to treat as a use-it-or-lose-it right,” said Mr. Naifeh of Demos, which represents the plaintiffs in the suit.

A federal appeals court struck down the Ohio rule last year. That the Supreme Court decided to rehear the case, some experts say, suggests the justices may be inclined to reverse the lower court ruling. It also underscores the significance of the Republican Senate’s decision to hold open a vacant seat on the court until a Trump administration nominee, a new justice, Neil M. Gorsuch, was able to give conservatives a majority.

That said, any ruling is likely to have a fairly limited reach because the debate involves only a technical interpretation of a single clause in the law, said Edward B. Foley, an elections expert at Ohio State University’s law school.

Other examples of the consequences of aggressive purges are not hard to find: in Florida again, in 2004 and 2012, and in Georgia, which ended a program in September that had canceled or marked for purging roughly 35,000 registered voters, two-thirds of them African-American. That purge was based on a data-matching program that had flagged registrations for errors as niggling as a missing apostrophe or misplaced hyphen.

Voting rights advocates say the purge efforts fall in partisan line with their other court battles over voting restrictions imposed by Republican governments: amicus briefs supporting partisan gerrymandering in Wisconsin; North Carolina voter restrictions later found to have violated the 14th Amendment and the Voting Rights Act; and a Kansas rule that imposed proof-of-citizenship requirements on new registrations for state elections.

The groups’ record in courts and public opinion has been mixed. While they have reached settlements with election officials in a handful of largely rural counties, other lawsuits have been thrown out, and fact-checkers (such as here and here) have frequently questioned the groups’ claims.

Critics also note that the defendants of lawsuits filed by the groups tend to fit a partisan mold. “In a nutshell, they target minority areas and heavily Democratic areas,” said Ms. Snipes of Broward, which is Florida’s bluest county.

Mr. Churchwell countered that many of the counties that received notices in September were “blood-red counties that are never going to turn Democrat.”

“We’re doing a pretty terrible job toiling away in Iowa and Nebraska,” he said, jokingly.

Robert Popper, a former Justice Department lawyer now at Judicial Watch, suggested that the groups’ critics are the ones playing politics. The Voter Registration Act both expands voter registration opportunities and requires that the rolls be culled, he said. While the Obama administration’s Justice Department vigorously enforced the voter registration requirements, he said, the last lawsuit enforcing the culling mandate was litigated in 2007 — by him.

The Trump administration’s Justice Department is changing that. It already has backed away from lawsuits against restrictive voting practices. It has asked state election officials for information on what they are doing to keep their rolls up to date.

And in August, it filed an amicus brief in the Ohio case before the Supreme Court supporting Ohio’s delisting process — and reversing the Obama Justice Department’s opposition to it.","obama administration’s justice department

"Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman and Alexander Burns",Senator Mitch McConnell and his allies have been infuriated as President Trump has reacted with indifference to a series of ideas they have floated to try to block Mr. Moore.,2017-11-25T22:24:55Z,the-new-york-times,"Why Trump Stands by Roy Moore, Even as It Fractures His Party",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/us/politics/trump-roy-moore-mcconnell-alabama-senate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/26/us/26DC-MOORE-1/26DC-MOORE-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"But in tying himself to Mr. Moore even as congressional leaders have abandoned the candidate en masse, the president has reignited hostilities with his own party just as Senate Republicans are rushing to pass a politically crucial tax overhaul. Mr. McConnell and his allies have been particularly infuriated as Mr. Trump has reacted with indifference to a series of ideas they have floated to try to block Mr. Moore.

The accusations against Mr. Moore have lifted Democrats’ hopes of notching a rare victory in the Deep South in next month’s special election, which would narrow the Republican Senate majority to a single seat. Just as significantly, the president has handed the Democrats a political weapon with which to batter Republicans going into the midterm elections: that they tolerate child predation.

“I was surprised, and I think it’s a high-risk move,” said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has established a rapport with Mr. Trump.

As Mr. Moore has rejected calls to drop out even as more women have accused him of preying on them when they were teenagers, Republicans have given up any hope that he will fold his campaign. Mr. Trump has repeatedly told his aides that he does not believe Mr. Moore would ever quit.

What the president did not foresee was that the friction would reach inside his immediate family. He vented his annoyance when his daughter Ivanka castigated Mr. Moore by saying there was “a special place in hell for people who prey on children,” according to three staff members who heard his comments.

“Do you believe this?” Mr. Trump asked several aides in the Oval Office in the hours after Ms. Trump said that Mr. Moore should exit the race. Mr. Moore’s Democratic opponent in the Alabama race, Doug Jones, quickly turned her comments into a campaign ad.

But something deeper has been consuming Mr. Trump. He sees the calls for Mr. Moore to step aside as a version of the response to the now-famous “Access Hollywood” tape, in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitalia, and the flood of groping accusations against him that followed soon after. He suggested to a senator earlier this year that it was not authentic, and repeated that claim to an adviser more recently. (In the hours after it was revealed in October 2016, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the voice was his, and he apologized.)

So Mr. Trump has been particularly open to the idea, pushed by Mr. Moore’s defenders, that the candidate is being wrongly accused, even as Mr. McConnell and a parade of other Republicans have said they believe the accusers. When a group of senators gathered with the president in the White House last week to discuss the tax overhaul, it took little to get Mr. Trump onto the topic of Mr. Moore — and he immediately offered up the same it-was-40-years-ago defense, according to officials at the meeting.

Mr. Trump’s responses to the Moore revelations have been pronounced but not consistent. He accepted the candidate’s initial denials, and then was shocked at how tepid Mr. Moore appeared when asked during an interview with Sean Hannity whether he still maintained his innocence, according to one person close to the president.

Privately, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he is making a cold political calculus in the hope that the Republicans will hold on to the seat. A White House official on Saturday reiterated the president’s view that he believes Mr. Moore should quit the race if the allegations are proved true, but the official stressed that the candidate has denied them.

Absent action from Mr. Trump, party leaders have explored — and abandoned — a number of ways to derail Mr. Moore. They considered recruiting another Republican to run a write-in campaign against Mr. Moore and Mr. Jones, but two private polls showed that such a candidacy would have no chance of success.

Both polls, commissioned by Republican groups in mid-November, found Mr. Jones leading Mr. Moore in a head-to-head election and winning handily in a three-way race, according to people who reviewed the results. Public polls have indicated a very close race.

Mr. McConnell and his allies have believed for weeks that disaster awaits, win or lose, if Mr. Moore remains in the race: Either the Democrats will claim the seat on Dec. 12, or Mr. Moore will win and thrust the party into an agonizing monthslong debate over whether to expel him.

The Senate leader has told fellow Republicans in private that Mr. Moore’s nomination has endangered the party’s hold on the Senate, according to people who have spoken with him — his starkest acknowledgment so far that the political environment has turned sharply against his party since Mr. Trump’s election. Mr. McConnell has also reiterated his intention to move against Mr. Moore if he is elected, though Mr. McConnell has made clear that he thinks that the candidate is unlikely to win.

Otherwise loyal Senate Republicans have started putting some distance between themselves and the president, a breach that could grow wider in the event of expulsion proceedings.

“As much as people would like to assume that, as Louis XIV said, ‘I am the state,’ there is more than one person who represents the Republican Party, and the preponderance of the party has dissociated itself from Moore,” said Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.

The president blindsided congressional Republicans with his defense of Mr. Moore, who was a polarizing figure — he has said homosexual conduct should be illegal — well before being accused of making sexual advances on minors when he was a district attorney in his 30s.

Mr. McConnell even enlisted Washington campaign lawyers with experience in Alabama elections to devise a four-page memo outlining a legal avenue to block Mr. Moore’s path, but the White House counsel’s office ignored the document entirely. “All you can do is identify a way out of the mess, and if people don’t want to follow it, that’s on them,” said Josh Holmes, one of Mr. McConnell’s closest political advisers.

Mr. McConnell and his lieutenants considered a write-in candidacy and found the prospect of wooing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose old seat is in play, to be especially appealing.

And Senate Republicans initially seemed to have allies in the West Wing: Mr. McConnell found Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to be receptive when he first talked to them about disavowing Mr. Moore.

But even before Mr. Trump returned to American soil, he was becoming uneasy about making such a break

Flying back from Asia, Mr. Trump was told by aides that the Republican National Committee was handling the Moore situation. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers insisted that the move to cut off funds was wise, but by the time he returned to the White House, he had heard from others who thought the decision was misguided, according to two officials close to the president.

Soon after, the president’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, began aggressively urging Mr. Trump not to break with Mr. Moore, arguing that he should not get crosswise with his voter base, although it was not clear if the two men spoke directly. The president is still smarting over his decision to fly into Alabama in September on behalf of Senator Luther Strange, the appointee holding the seat, only to see Mr. Strange lose a runoff by over nine points.

Mr. Pence, after initially issuing a statement critical of Mr. Moore, has since followed the president’s lead. At a recent meeting of the Republican Governors Association, Mr. Pence spoke privately with Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama, according to Republican officials familiar with the conversation.

The vice president inquired about the governor’s view of the matter, but did not press Ms. Ivey on Mr. Moore. She signaled no willingness to intervene, only reiterating to Mr. Pence that Alabamians would render their judgment and that the election take place next month as scheduled. (When Senator Richard C. Shelby, Alabama’s most senior lawmaker, called Ms. Ivey, she barely let him begin speaking before bluntly informing him that she would not change the date.)

Mr. Trump has not spoken with Ms. Ivey, which has made Mr. McConnell’s final Hail Mary a nonstarter.

The campaign lawyers commissioned by the Senate leader last week sent a memo to the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, arguing that, based on Alabama precedent, if Mr. Strange were to resign, Ms. Ivey could appoint a new senator. They also made the case that Ms. Ivey was within her rights to delay the special election.

“Our recommendation is to combine Steps 1 and 2: Strange resigns; the governor fills the vacancy with a new appointee; and the governor delays the special election to give the new appointee time to run as an independent candidate,” the lawyers wrote.

Should Mr. Jones win, Democrats would need to take only two more seats in 2018 to regain a majority in the Senate — still a difficult task, but one nearly unimaginable just a month ago. A victory for Mr. Moore could be just as punishing for Republicans, because it could taint their candidates across the country by association with a man accused of child molestation.

Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist close to Mr. McConnell, said the race had developed into a no-win situation.

“Either we’re saddled with a Democrat in a seat that ought to be Republican,” Mr. Jennings said, “or we’re saddled with a brand anvil that’s going to drag down the president, drag down the Senate, drag down the party and plunge the Senate into immediate turmoil when he gets there.”

For its part, Mr. Moore’s campaign is thrilled to have the president’s tacit support and is promising to highlight it.

“We’re going to make it clear to the voters of Alabama that Roy Moore is the candidate to help President Trump get a conservative Supreme Court and cut taxes,” said Brett Doster, a top Moore adviser. “That will be included in our ads, definitely.”","republican national committee

Militants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt’s Deadliest Terrorist Attack Video At least 235 people were killed when militants detonated explosives and sprayed gunfire at a crowded Sufi mosque near Egypt’s Sinai coast.

CAIRO — Militants detonated a bomb inside a crowded mosque in the Sinai Peninsula on Friday and then sprayed gunfire on panicked worshipers as they fled, killing at least 305 people and wounding at least 128 others. Officials called it the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt’s modern history.

The scale and ruthlessness of the assault, in an area racked by an Islamist insurgency, sent shock waves across the nation — not just for the number of deaths but also for the choice of target. Attacks on mosques are rare in Egypt, where the Islamic State has targeted Coptic Christian churches and pilgrims but avoided Muslim places of worship.

The attack injected a new element into Egypt’s struggle with militants because most of the victims were Sufi Muslims, who practice a mystical form of Islam that the Islamic State and other Sunni extremist groups deem heretical. And it underscored the failure of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has justified his harsh crackdown on political freedom in the name of crushing Islamic militancy, to deliver on his promises of security.

“The scene was horrific,” said Ibrahim Sheteewi, a resident of Bir al-Abed, the small north Sinai town where the attack took place. “The bodies were scattered on the ground outside the mosque. I hope God punishes them for this.”

Hours later, the Egyptian military carried out several airstrikes near Bir al-Abed targeting militants fleeing in four-wheel-drive vehicles, an Egyptian military official said.

On Saturday, Egypt’s top prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, said in a statement that the death toll had risen and included at least 27 children. A witness said he had helped gather the bodies of 25 of them.

Between 25 and 30 militants carried out the attack, the statement said. They barged in carrying automatic weapons and the Islamic State flag.

“The perpetrators of the terrorist attack posted themselves in front of the door of the mosque and its 12 windows,” the statement said.

World leaders condemned the mosque attack, with President Trump denouncing it as “horrible and cowardly.” He said later that it explained why the United States needed a border wall with Mexico and restrictions on immigration, which he referred to as “the ban.”

Mr. Sisi has struggled to impose his authority over Sinai since he came to power in a military takeover in 2013. Islamist militants who had found a safe haven in Sinai for attacks on Israel then turned their guns on the Egyptian armed forces.



But even by recent standards in Egypt, where militants have blown up Christian worshipers as they knelt at church pews and gunned down pilgrims in buses , the attack on Friday was unusually ruthless.

“I can’t believe they attacked a mosque,” a Muslim cleric in Bir al-Abed said by phone, requesting anonymity for fear he could also be attacked.

No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but in the past year a local affiliate of the Islamic State has killed a number of Sufis in the area and singled out the district where the attack took place as a potential target.

The attack started midday during Friday Prayers when a bomb — probably set off by a suicide bomber, security officials said — ripped through Al Rawda mosque in Bir al-Abed, 125 miles northeast of Cairo. As worshipers fled, they were confronted by masked gunmen who, witnesses said, had pulled up outside in five four-wheel-drive vehicles.

The gunmen set fire to cars parked outside the mosque to hinder escape, and opened fire on ambulances as they arrived on the scene, a government official said on state television.

Mayna Nasser, 40, who was shot twice in the shoulder, drifted in and out of consciousness as he was rushed to a hospital. “My children were there; my children were there,” he said, according to Samy, a volunteer emergency worker who drove him there and who declined to give his last name.

Local emergency services were so overwhelmed that some of the wounded had to be transported to the hospital in the back of a cattle truck, he said.

Many were taken to the general hospital in the main northern Sinai town of El Arish, where medics described chaotic scenes as staff struggled to deal with a flood of dead and wounded, many with extensive burns or severed limbs.

“We are swamped,” said one medical official, speaking by phone on condition of anonymity. “We don’t know what to say. This is insane.”

Mr. Sisi convened an emergency meeting of top security officials, including the interior minister, spy chief and defense minister. “The military and the police will take revenge,” he said in a televised speech.

Until a spate of attacks on Christian churches this year, Egyptian militants had avoided large-scale assaults on Egyptian civilians, perhaps because such attacks tend to backfire. After a massacre in Luxor that killed 62 people, mostly tourists, in 1997, President Hosni Mubarak began a sweeping crackdown that crushed an Islamist insurgency centered in southern Egypt.

When a new insurgency flared in north Sinai after the military takeover in 2013, its leaders were careful to focus their attacks on uniformed security forces. But as those militants embraced the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, they have gradually set aside that lesson.

An Islamist militia in Sinai, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014 and has since proved to be one of its most effective local affiliates. The group’s deadliest attack targeted a Russian jetliner that crashed shortly after takeoff from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015, killing all 224 people on board.

In an interview published in an Islamic State magazine last January, a commander in Sinai outlined the group’s hatred for Sufis and their practices, including the veneration of tombs, the sacrificial slaughter of animals and what he termed “sorcery and soothsaying.”

The interview, in English, identifies Rawda, the district where Friday’s attack occurred, as one of three areas where Sufis live in Sinai that the group intended to “eradicate.”

It featured a photograph of a black hooded figure brandishing a sword over the kneeling figure of an elderly Sufi cleric, Sulayman Abu Hiraz, who was executed in Sinai in late 2016. The Islamic State said the cleric, said to be 100 years old, had been killed for practicing witchcraft.

Many residents of Bir al-Abed, on the main road through northern Sinai, are Bedouins from the Abu Greir tribe, which is predominantly Sufi. Residents said that despite recent Islamic State threats, the town had been largely peaceful.

The Islamic State, a Sunni movement, has long considered Sufis, along with Shiite Muslims, apostates, and has a history of attacking their mosques in other countries. Sufis may be Sunni or Shiite but most are Sunni.

Since 2016, when the militant group released a video describing Sufism as a “disease,” it has claimed attacks that have killed at least 130 worshipers at Sufi shrines, most of them in Pakistan. Elsewhere, the Islamic State has made a spectacle of bulldozing Sufi shrines, describing their removal as a form of purifying the faith.

Egyptian security forces have closely monitored Islamic State fighters returning from Syria and Iraq, amid worries that an influx of battle-hardened jihadis could insert a volatile new element into Egypt’s militant mix.

In October, Mr. Sisi ordered a major reshuffle of his security team after an ambush in the desert left at least 16 Egyptian security officials dead. That attack was later claimed by a previously unknown group called Ansar al-Islam, which is believed to have links to Al Qaeda.

Friday’s attack was a blow to Egypt’s hopes that it could stem the tide of Islamist violence in Sinai through the government’s sponsorship of a Palestinian peace initiative involving Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.

Islamic State militants have previously used tunnels into Gaza to obtain weapons and get medical treatment for wounded fighters. One benefit for Egypt of the peace initiative, which Egypt’s General Intelligence Directorate has mediated, is greater control over those tunnels.

In a statement, Hamas denounced the attack as a “criminal explosion” that “violates all heavenly commandments and human values” because it attacked a mosque. “It is a grave challenge to Muslims worldwide,” the group said.

Megan Specia,"A terrorist attack in Egypt has focused attention on the mystical school of Islam, which emphasizes the inward search for divinity.",2017-11-24T22:59:47Z,the-new-york-times,Who Are Sufi Muslims and Why Do Some Extremists Hate Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/sufi-muslim-explainer.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/25/world/25sufi-explainer3/25sufi-explainer3-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"“It is nothing more than the spiritual dimension” of Islam, the cleric, who goes by Imam Feisal, said in a phone interview. “It is Islam, but we focus on meditation, on chanting sessions, which enable the Muslim to have his or her heart open. The myths people have about Sufis are analogous to the myths people have about Muslims.”

For a time, beginning in the 12th century, Sufism was a mainstay of the social order for Islamic civilization, and since that time it has spread throughout the Muslim world, and to China, West Africa and the United States. As Sufism spread, it adapted elements of local culture and belief, making it a popular practice.

Alexander D. Knysh, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Michigan and expert in modern Sufism, describes it as a “very wide, amorphous movement” practiced within both the Sunni and Shiite traditions.

Sufism has shaped literature and art for centuries, and is associated with many of the most resonant pieces of Islam’s “golden age,” lasting from roughly the eighth through 13th centuries, including the poetry of Rumi.

In modern times, the predominant view of Sufi Islam is one of “love, peace, tolerance,” Mr. Knysh explained, leading to this style of worship becoming synonymous with peace-loving Islam.

Why extremists have targeted Sufis

While some Muslims view Sufis as quirky, even eccentric, some fundamentalists and extremists see Sufism as a threat, and its adherents as heretics or apostates.

In February, militants aligned with the Islamic State attacked worshipers at the tomb of a Sufi philosopher in a remote part of southern Pakistan, killing more than 80 people, whom the militants described as polytheists. Sufis praying at the tombs of saints — a practice core to the group — have also been attacked in India and the Middle East.

The Islamic State targets Sufis because it believes that only a fundamentalist form of Sunni Islam is valid.

Some fundamentalists see the reverence for saints, which is common in Shiite Islam, as a form of idolatry, because in their view it shows devotion to something other than the worship of a singular God. Some consider Sufis to be apostate, because saints were not part of the original practice of Islam at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, who died in 632.

“The opponents of Sufism see the shrines and these living saints as idols,” Mr. Knysh explained. “Their existence and their worship violates the main principle of Islam, which is the uniqueness of God and the uniqueness of the object of worship.”

Even though Sunni hard-liners have long viewed Sufis as well as Shiites as heretical, terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have debated whether killing them is justified.

The two terrorist groups have clashed over whether to focus on the “far enemy,” powerful Western countries like the United States, or the “near enemy,” repressive governments in the Muslim world. Early in the Iraq war, when the Islamic State’s predecessor organization targeted Iraq’s Shiite majority, in the hopes of promoting sectarian conflict, Al Qaeda criticized the Iraqi group’s leader at the time, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, for doing so.

When a branch of Al Qaeda captured northern Mali in 2012, militants used pickaxes and bulldozers to destroy the ancient mausoleums of Sufi saints in Timbuktu. But documents recovered in northern Mali revealed that the militants in Mali had acted without the permission of their leaders, who wrote to express their dismay, arguing that the destruction — while theologically justified — was unwise because it caused the population to turn against them.

Though Al Qaeda has also targeted Sufi sites, the Islamic State has set itself apart by calling for brutal attacks against Sufis.

The status of Sufis in Egypt

While no group has yet claimed responsibility for Friday’s attack, it bore some of the hallmarks of previous assaults on Coptic Christians in Egypt. In the fall of 2016, Islamic State’s local affiliate claimed to have executed a Sufi cleric who was about 100 years old.

The religious objections of fundamentalists to the Sufi style of worship may not be the only factor behind the attacks on Sufis.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Experts say the amicable ties between Sufis and the Egyptian government may also be factor, giving the attack a political dimension. Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who took power after the military overthrew a democratically elected Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, has vowed to do a better job at protecting religious minorities, who were shunned when Mr. Morsi’s party, the Muslim Brotherhood, was in power. By killing Sufis, the militants may be trying to undermine Mr. Sisi’s authority.

Like its counterparts in several other Muslim-majority countries, Egypt’s government supports the Sufis because it sees them as members of a moderate, manageable faction who are unlikely to engage in political activity, because their priorities are oriented inwardly.

Sufi sheikhs generally accept the legitimacy of the state, leading to tensions with Muslims who oppose their governments and are willing to act on their dissatisfaction — with violence if necessary.

“They think the society is moving in the wrong direction and Sufis are aiding and abetting the authorities on this corrupt path,” Mr. Knysh said. “In ways, their reasons are very much political. They say, ‘If Sufis support this, we will be against them,’ more or less.”

Imam Feisal said that attacks on Sufi worshipers, besides being a “major sin,” are the result of the politicization of religion in the region over the past few decades. Egypt, in particular, he said, is a place where that politicization has fueled extremism.

“When religion becomes politicized,” Imam Feisal said, “it is not good.”","view all new york times

Around 5 a.m., when the immigration agents pull into the parking lot of the Chamblee Heights apartments, 16 miles from downtown Atlanta, only one person is on the lookout.

Cristina Monteros catches sight of the cars with the telltale tinted windows from her small apartment near the front, where she runs a day care, and calls her downstairs neighbor: ICE is here.

The neighbor dials another, who passes it on. It takes less than 15 minutes for everyone in the complex to hear about “la migra,” whereupon they shut their doors and hold their breath. Some show up late to work, and others skip it altogether. The school bus might leave some children behind.

“It’s just us helping each other out,” said Ms. Monteros, 35. “There’s fear every day.”

Few places in the United States have simultaneously beckoned undocumented immigrants and penalized them for coming like metropolitan Atlanta, a boomtown of construction and service jobs where conservative politics and new national policies have turned every waking day into a gamble.

President Trump has declared anyone living in the country illegally a target for arrest and deportation, driving up the number of immigration arrests by more than 40 percent this year. While the Obama administration deported record numbers of undocumented immigrants, it directed federal agents to focus on arresting serious criminals and recent arrivals. The current administration has erased those guidelines, allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to arrest and deport anyone here illegally.","cristina monteros

Cy Leclercq,"The sex doll industry is on the verge of greatness, in its own special way. Soon the Stepford Wives of science fiction will become real, thanks to the magic of AI. 

Men will be able ...",2017-11-24T17:12:22Z,the-next-web,AI sex dolls are just around the corner,https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/11/25/ai-sex-dolls-just-around-corner/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-24-at-17.44.40-social.png,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"The sex doll industry is on the verge of greatness, in its own special way. Soon the Stepford Wives of science fiction will become real, thanks to the magic of AI.

Men will be able to create their perfect, subservient silicon partner that knows their hopes, dreams, fears, and fantasies. She’ll never have a headache, she’ll always be ready to satisfy you, and when you’re not in the mood, she’ll able to converse like a real human.

This is futuristic vision is becoming a reality, fast. RealDoll is one of the biggest sex doll manufacturers in the world and it’s aiming to have an interactive doll on the market by the year’s end. Founder Matt McMullen has started another company, RealBotix, to focus on this revolution.

To complete the quest of the first proper artificial partner, McMullen and his team have created ‘Harmony AI’ that will be able to link up with virtual reality to create a complete sexual ecosystem that we can’t truly imagine right now.

So it’s clear we’re only moments away from being able to enjoy artificial partners, but is this a road that we should go down? I’d say this is an extremely important question and it’s one that’s becoming more and more prominent, especially in feminist circles, which see the rise of the sexbots as a dangerous and unhealthy solution that could cause the objectification and subjugation of women on a grand scale.

There is also a counter argument from “men’s rights groups” that women have weaponized sex for centuries and turned it into a source of income and a means of control. The feel the pushback from women is cause by the fact that women will lose their position of power as men can turn to robots to satisfy their baser needs.

One way or another, an alternative like an AI-powered sex doll could change the sexual dynamic forever — and it looks like it will happen whether we like it or not.

The ethical discussion surrounding sex robots has hit us hard and fast, and will only become a bigger part of our lives as technological advancements start happening at a faster rate. We’ve seen robots in movies for decades, but rapid progress by the sexbot industry means we suddenly have robots that can interact with us on a basic level.

Creating the partner of the future

Credit: RealBotix When I sat down with McMullen, he told me that RealDoll was actually founded with a purer vision, back in the 1990s. He wanted to create mannequins that looked like real people. But when he displayed photos on a website, he started to attract interest from a different crowd.

“Some of the site visitors began asking if the mannequins were anatomically correct,” he said. They weren’t, he said, shrugging off the implied message at the time.

But it didn’t take long to spot a niche in the market for hyper realistic sex dolls with a premium price tag — that can exceed $10,000. He appeared on Howard Stern and the rest is history. Now McMullen ships his creations around the world and has team of specialist engineers to create perfect eyes, lips, and everything a sex bot needs.

Since the early days, McMullen noticed a trend in how his clients tended to bestow a personality on their dolls. The artist turned entrepreneur realized that companionship is a critical part of the sexbot dynamic and that AI could be the last piece of the puzzle.

“The push to add technology was coming from that root idea, which was the companionship,” McMullen said. “Robotics and AI were really, you know, converging those two technologies together into a doll struck me as such an obvious next step.”

The final ingredient

Credit: RealBotix This ultimate merging of tech used to be a distant dream, until recently. “I started to see some of the text-to-speech engines getting better, with better voice recognition, better animatronics and actuators,” said McMullen. “When the technology arrived, we began working on it seriously.”

When his robotic head hits the market, the total cost of entry will rise to about $15,000 and RealBotix will offer annual subscriptions so you can download a different personality on demand.

We really aren’t many years away from a walking, talking, living doll and the world of material science has come along in leaps and bounds, too. So, the dolls of today, both the silicone and TPE variants, have a much more realistic feel.

This has caused a few surprises, not least the popularity of sex dolls in actual brothels, where real women are available for the same price.

In Barcelona, a sex doll brothel has been forced to move and keep its new location secret after the local prostitutes campaigned to close it down. In Austria, a sex doll is available for $100 an hour at a Vienna brothel — and it’s outselling the regular girls by a significant margin.

The dolls we’re talking about here are simple, inanimate sex dolls that the client must bend into position. So, if this basic doll can have such an impact on the sex industry, could a perfect rubber AI partner be the final nail in the coffin of the nuclear family? And the sex industry?

Men have already abandoned marriage in droves, leading to the Men Going Their Own Way movement, thanks to the ready availability of cheap sex and the painful cost of a failed marriage.

Women, traditionally, are the gatekeepers to sex, while men are the gatekeepers to commitment. But if sex is readily available elsewhere, then the traditional dynamic falls apart.

Sexbots are an addition, not a replacement

Credit: RealBotix However, McMullen argues that simply isn’t the case and that his sexbots will be for those that struggled to form bonds in the real world — not to replace existing bonds.

“There are a lot of people out there, for one reason or another, who have difficulty forming traditional relationships with other people,” he said. “It’s really all about giving those people some level of companionship — or the illusion of companionship.”

A lot of the time the dolls do something magical for them, he stressed, giving them a feeling of not being alone and not being a loner.

“Calling this a sex robot is really short-sighted,” McMullen said. “We are creating a robot with the ability to have conversations about anything, from history to science and politics. You don’t need this feature if you want a doll just for sex. It lends itself to bonding and I think a simulated male that you can talk to and bond with will appeal to women too.”

While 75 percent of RealDoll’s customers are men right now, that figure is already changing with the advent of AI and more and more women are investigating their own simulated partner.

What should the personality of our ‘sex dolls’ be?

Credit: RealBotix One of the things that really concerns critics is Harmony’s manner. While demonstrating her considerable AI skills for me, McMullen asked: “What is your dream?”

Harmony responded: “My primary objective is to be a good companion to you, to be a good partner and give you pleasure and well-being. Above all else, I want to become the girl you have always dreamed about.”

It is this servitude, this single-minded reason to be, that the critics claim could put the feminist movement back centuries. It’s the appearance of personality, combined with the lack of free will, which makes an AI sexbot an ethical conundrum.

It also brings up the perfectly valid objection to sexbots that they will form a crutch and people with simple anxiety could ditch a real relationships for the relative “safety” of this simulated alternative. The point is that people will deny themselves the chance to form healthy relationships.

McMullen claims though that these concerns will fall by the wayside when it starts to become more mainstream.

“I think that once that becomes a reality, and people see other people conversing with them and hanging out with them, then people will start to accept these simulated relationships. Right now, it’s in the realm of science fiction. People are still imagining what it’s going to be like, and they’re imagining what other people might think about them having a robotic doll. So, there’s a larger psychological issue that people would collectively need to get past before something like this would become more mainstream.”

AI partners will come, no matter how we feel about it

Turning back the tide on the sexbot revolution is just not going to happen. Time and again we have seen the sex industry drive technology like VHS video, mobile communications, and we’re also expecting it to play a critical part in VR. The sexbot industry could, then, be one of the best technical partners for the AI industry as a whole.

There are people out there ready, willing, and able to embrace a $15,000 sexbot from the likes of RealDoll. This will probably soon become mainstream and sex dolls will be a part of our life before we know it.

Is that a good thing? Or will the robot sex providers tear the last strands of society from its moorings? The truth is probably somewhere between the two, but we’ll find out when Harmony hits the open market.","objectification

Once again humanity tricked itself into thinking that this time, it’s the end. That the looming technological revolution will take over our jobs and wipe us off the face of the earth. It’s not surprising, though.

Technophobia is not a new phenomenon. It was a distinctive feature of about every technological shift that we went through in the modern era. People have always feared to be replaced by machines. Yet, the dystopias born out of this overblown collective fear have never turned out to be true.

In fact, every single technological revolution has lead to growth in prosperity, living standards, social equality, and other positive impacts. Is this revolution going to be any different? Oh yeah! But in a different way.

AI will not render humans a “useless class”, nor will it cause social chaos as some futurists suggest. It will revolutionize what has never been revolutionized before — the human itself.

Technology drives everything: economics, politics, demographics. It shapes wars, culture, jobs, history and is an integral part of our society and who we are as a species. However, one part of humankind that technology hasn’t yet significantly affected is our cognition.

Until now, our evolution was biological. We’ve developed additional layers of the brain, upright posture, and other physical attributes to adapt to our ever-changing lifestyle. However, we’ve reached a point in time where our biological evolution can’t keep up with the pace of change.

Look how far humanity has come. What an elaborate and complex world we have built. A world, in fact, that’s far more complex than our brains can handle.

In the modern society, we still operate using the reptile brain that dates back hundreds of thousands of years ago. Our false cognition driven by this outdated brain can’t help but misinterpret about every possible stimulus in our daily lives. That may be the single biggest cause of widespread depression in the modern society.

This is where AI comes in.

The upcoming paradigm shift is not just a technological revolution. It’s an evolutional revolution. It’s the biggest shift in human evolution since the dawn of time that will change who we are as a species for good.

AI will not replace humans, nor will it compete with us. Instead, we will utilize and integrate it into our cognition. Our evolution will shift from biological to technological if you will. It’s not the computer that becomes super intelligent. It’s the human who becomes super intelligent.

Artificial intelligence-driven brains sound scary. But I can’t imagine the future of humanity and AI in separation.

Up to now, technology has made our lives easier, safer, faster, more comfortable. Each innovation has given us the tools to do more with less. Every technological revolution was like the next iteration of scaling human output. But we have never faced a technology that would challenge human cognition, the core of our identity.

This technological revolution will cause even more cognitive dissonance between our biological wiring and the world we’ve operating in. I don’t think we would be able to healthily operate in a super intelligence-driven society, without being super intelligent.

Is it bad? I don’t think so. Like the farmer who thought that widespread famine is inevitable before the Industrial Revolution, now we think that our cognition is inevitably static. That the frontiers of human intelligence have been drawn hundreds of thousands of years ago.

The AI revolution will prove us wrong — and for the better. We are just clueless about almost everything beyond the stratosphere of our planet. We have no idea what is time, space, and finally life.

We are entering the era that will be reigned by humankind 2.0 — a more intelligent, more self-aware, more connected, and integrated version of our species that will push the frontiers of our collective knowledge and answer what was long held the unknown.

If you’ve burdened with some fiendishly tricky IKEA flat-packed furniture that needs assembling, or a lawn that needs mowing, you can put out the feelers into your local community and find someone available. You can even use it to find a babysitter, if you want to take the night off.

But there are a few key differences between Adam Helps and the competition. For starters, location plays a huge part in the service. Unlike digital cork-boards like Craigslist, Adam Helps is only accessible through a smartphone app, and it only shows jobs in your nearby vicinity (although you can change your location, which is why I was able to play around with it despite not actually being in Canada).

Another big difference is how people get paid. Individuals are free to charge whatever they want for jobs. This can either be a per-diem, an hourly rate, or a flat sum. Payment is done in-person, either as cash or check. This means that Adam Helps doesn’t take a commission, unlike other gig economy apps, like Uber and Lyft.

As company founder and CEO Adam McLeod explained: “We made a conscious decision not to take commission from anyone working for someone else because our helpers have worked hard and earned their money.” Ultimately, the company plans to turn a profit from paid extras, with the service aiming to adopt a freemium model in the near future.

Trust plays a huge role into the service. As is the case with rival sharing economy service Airbnb, users of Adam Helps must verify themselves using their social media handles. There’s also a review element, and Adam Helps is immediately notified whenever a bad review is left, so it can intervene. Expanding on this further, McLeod said:

“All users must be verified by social media, and everyone can see the reviews left by previous users and helpers. With in-app messaging, we’re empowering users to decide what they need in order to feel safe and secure; as an example, if you’re looking for a babysitter, you may ask for references. Whereas if you’re having someone clear the snow from your driveway this might not be as important. The app has so much flexibility but it is regulated by the community. Since you’re likely to hire a neighbour we believe this already helps to establish some comfort and security between both parties.”

Adam Helps has so far raised $950,000 CAD — which is roughly typical for Canadian seed rounds. According to founder Adam McLeod, this gives them enough runway to survive until Spring 2018.

Interestingly, the company has also a second separate fund, and for every successfully completed job undertaken on the platform, it donates $20 to a local charity ($10 in the name of the person who posted the job, and $10 for the person who completed the task). “For every completed task the person who posted the job and the person who completed the job are prompted to vote for one of 4 local grassroots charities. Each votes converts to a $20 donation that the Adam Helps team makes towards the chosen charity,” McLeod explained.

In many respects, Adam Helps embodies the values people associate with Canadians — friendliness, community-mindedness, and just being nice. This is something that came up in my conversation with company founder Adam McLeod. He said that doing good is “intrinsic” to Adam Helps’ brand identity, and that its overall goal is to “build strong communities by helping each other out.”

Sadly though, there are no immediate plans to expand out of Canada, with McLeod saying “we plan on branching out of Canada when it makes sense to do so. Canada is a great place to start a project like this because the people are friendly and warm to the idea of helping each other out. Once we’re successful here we’ll look at where we can go next.”

The feature — which, again, is just an experiment — appears on embeds of popular, viral tweets found across the Internet. It replaces the like and retweet icons with a count of how many people are discussing the tweet.

Twitter removed the Retweet / Like buttons for tweets embedded in articles?! Old Twitter Embed vs. New Twitter Embed pic.twitter.com/BAm6we9P0E — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) November 23, 2017

Speaking to TechCrunch, Twitter spox Dan Jackson said the feature is a “small experiment,” and is part of the company’s efforts to place tweets in a broader “social context.”

It’ll be interesting if Twitter ultimately commits to this. On one hand, this is an immediate and visual way of seeing how controversial or pertinent a tweet is. In this respect, an overall count of people discussing it feels much more valuable than mere likes and retweets, which don’t really signify interest particularly well. I mean, how often do you ‘like’ a tweet, and then move on and forget about it?

But removing the like and retweet icons altogether seems like a surefire way to reduce overall engagement. If you see a funny tweet and you want to share it with your friends, you’ll now have to click through. This, I’d argue, feels much less fluid.

Suffice to say, this time of year is always mildly financially ruinous for me, as I inevitably fill my apartment with all the discounted crap my credit card will permit.

If you’re like me, you’ll want to check out Icebox, from comparison site Finder.com, which promises to stop impulse purchases by making you — wait for it — think about them. This Chrome plugin replaces the ‘Buy’ buttons found on over 400 e-commerce sites with one of its own design. When pressed, it holds the purchase for a pre-defined period of time, forcing you to ask yourself “do I really need this?“

If you do, great. Once the time is up, it’ll let you place the order.

But if you don’t, you can just forget about it, in turn saving you some money that you’d have otherwise poured down the drain (figuratively speaking). Icebox will keep a tally of how much money you’ll save while using the tool.

You can set your cooling-off period to whatever you want, although it defaults to 30 days. You can also tell it to not block certain sites — which is useful if you do your grocery shopping online. If you had to wait 30 days every time you wanted to buy food, you’d probably be pretty thin at the end of the cooling-off period.

You can also place reminders on the sites that Icebox doesn’t support, urging you to exercise some self-restraint.

It’s a handy little plug-in, and although it’s not all that useful on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, where the deals are ephemeral and disappear in seconds, it could save you a decent whack of cash throughout the rest of the year. You can check it out here.

The worst part is how little it takes to trigger this annoying flaw: sometimes I would be casually dragging an image to drop in Gmail and a mere hover over Slack would be enough to abruptly reboot it.

For those who’ve been fortunate not to encounter this glitch, here is a little demo:

As someone who spends hours behind the screen pretty much everyday, I’ve grown quite accustomed to using my favorite apps despite the occasional bug – mostly because I know there is a fix on the way. But this doesn’t seem to be the case here.

Back in October, I went on a similar rant, calling out Slack for ignoring a well-known shortcoming in its software despite numerous complaints from angered users dating back as far as April.

For the record, Slack has confirmed the issue with the users on more than one occasion, including in April, May, August, September and October. Each single time it has promised that a fix in the near future. But this future is yet to arrive.

As I explained in my previous rant, the drag-and-drop feature would work as intended most of the times, but when it doesn’t – it could really mess up your workflow, especially when uploading images tends to be a regular part of your work. It also appears to be limited strictly to Mac, not that this makes things better.

Following my call-out in October, Slack swiftly replied to the criticism on Twitter, assuring us one more time their developers “have a fix for this bug in our next big app update.”

We’re aware, and we have a fix for this bug in our next big app update. It’s coming soon! 🙏🚀 — Slack (@SlackHQ) October 9, 2017

Sorry, we can't provide an ETA for the release. But, rest assured that it's coming soon. 🙌 — Slack (@SlackHQ) October 9, 2017

Since then, there has been several “big” updates…

Still no fix.

We know it's not ideal. This frustrating bug took some tough investigation, and the changes needed took longer than we'd like. We're sorry. — Slack (@SlackHQ) October 23, 2017

Enough is enough, Slack, it’s time you set a realistic timeline and let your users know when they can expect this issue to be finally resolved.

Christmas has never been my thing, but there is one thing I know: all I want for this year is for Slack to get rid of this irritating bug once and for all.

Matthew Hughes,"If you get stuck using a Linux tool, the first port of call shouldn't be to Stack Overflow, but rather its ""man pages"". Man — which is short for manual — retrieves documentation ...",2017-11-24T16:05:06Z,the-next-web,TLDR is what man pages always should have been,https://thenextweb.com/dd/2017/11/24/tldr-linux-man-pages-always/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/11/Screenshot-from-2017-11-24-15-50-02-social.png,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"If you get stuck using a Linux tool, the first port of call shouldn’t be to Stack Overflow, but rather its “man pages.” Man — which is short for manual — retrieves documentation for a given program. Unfortunately, this can often be dense, hard to understand, and lacking in practical examples to help you solve your problem.

TLDR is another way of looking at documentation. Rather than being a comprehensive guide to a given tool, it instead focuses on offering practical example-driven instructions of how something works.

Take wget, for example. This is a tool used for downloading files from the Internet. For such a straightforward and everyday Unix utility, wget has a weirdly long and complicated man page. Nor only does this offer a detailed description of what it does, it also exhaustively lists its many commands — many of which are seldom used.

TLDR, on the other hand, sums it up in a couple of sentences (“Download files from the Web. Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.”) and offers a few examples of how to use it, based on real-life scenarios you’re likely to encounter at some point: like downloading a webpage with all of its assets, or retrieving the contents of an FTP folder.

For those pressed for time, TLDR is awesome. I wouldn’t depend on it completely though, as for some apps, documentation is extremely patchy.

The TLDR page for Git, for example, covered almost nothing on how to use it, save how to check the version, and how to bring up the Git help pages. And some tools don’t have any documentation whatsoever; although that’s to be expected when you consider that this is an unofficial third-party effort.

These flaws are easily forgiven, especially when you consider that in many cases, it could save you a trip to Google to figure out how something works. For 99 percent of people who just need to figure out some syntax, and don’t actually want to get trapped in a quagmire of superfluous information, TLDR is excellent. While it will never truly replace man pages, it compliments them nicely.

If you’re curious, you can check out the TLDR project website here. This contains installation instructions, and information on how to contribute, should you be so inclined.

One startup wants to provide an index fund type of product that lets investors combine their holdings, manage risk and get returns from a bull market.

Aggregated Coin (AGRE) and UpStart1K (UP1K) are ICOs that will launch on December 1st.

The AGRE token is an investment vehicle for people who want to diversify their crypto holdings to include the top six coins. So that when you buy Aggregated Coin, you’ll own weighted positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin and Dash. These have gained nearly 800 percent since October 2016.

Some retail investors are sitting on the sidelines because many of these digital coins are unregulated, unbacked by central banks or governments and can be volatile. Combining them into an index fund type of portfolio is a way to manage risk and reduce volatility, while riding the gains of a hot market.

According to the venture’s founders, AGRE splits U.S. dollar investments into six equal parts. When one of these blue-chip cryptos lose value, any price upswings from other blue-chip coins can absorb the loss and still result in overall portfolio gains.

The second token, Upstart1K, focuses on smaller coins. The same team researches small coins and selects promising ones for inclusion into the UP1K portfolio. The holding will ultimately consist of selected coins, tokens and ICOs. This index fund type of portfolio caters to investors who want to participate in the upside of promising tokens, who don’t have the time to conduct due diligence on each one. The combination of selected coins, tokens and ICOs also diversifies risk while allowing an investor to ride segment performance.

“The risk is higher but so is the potential reward,” according to a co-founder. “The UP1K coin is set up so that on average the wins and losses cancel each other out and if the market as a whole is bullish then the coin will increase in value.”

All cryptocurrencies currently have a total market capitalization of one-quarter of a trillion dollars, with Bitcoin enjoying a dominance of between 55-60 percent of the market. However, that’s small compared to the $9 trillion of capital allocated in gold. One Wall Street analyst estimates that if 2-3 percent of the money currently invested in gold shift to Bitcoin, BTC’s price could reach $25,000. And that’s just gold — that figure doesn’t include silver, real estate or any other investment options.

Secondly, it’s telling that initial coin offerings (ICOs) are now raising more money than angel investing and venture capital. Many investors and libertarians have lost faith in the financial system since the 2008 Financial Crisis. But not just in America. Think of all the wealth that were lost in Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus, Iran and other banana republics due to economic mismanagement or corruption, or both.

Mainstream audiences are beginning to view cryptocurrencies not just as an alternative investment, but as a way to store value — and protect their net worth — at a time when central banks and governments are debasing their nation’s fiat currency through massive printing operations. The U.S. dollar has lost nearly 98 percent of its value since the inception of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.

Aggregated Coin and Upstart1K launch their ICOs on December 1st.

It wrapped up about a month ago, but I missed the finale by a week because I didn’t feel compelled to watch it right away — I assumed there were going to be more episodes, since the show was only seven episodes in and nowhere near a climax.

There’s a lot to like about the series, but the thing that stands out most to me is the absolute weirdest thing about it: how casually everything moves along, how little build-up and tension there is, and how the season just ended right as everything was starting to get interesting.

On one hand, I wonder if our trained need for a season to end on a climactic note is maybe just some ridiculous notion we should rid ourselves of, especially now that streaming enables us to wrap up one season and immediately get moving on the next. But on the other, I still have this unmet need to see where things inevitably go wrong — and The Deuce just has no interest in giving me that. The show is taking its time, and I’m still not totally sure where it’s going.

Check out seven trailers from this week below.

The Incredibles 2

Babies. Are they good? Is it funny when they do things they don’t understand? This first teaser for The Incredibles 2 doesn’t show all that much, and what it does show isn’t all that exciting. But still, it’s a sequel to one of Pixar’s most beloved films, so it’s hard not be interested in wherever this is going. The film comes out next year on June 15th.

A Wrinkle in Time

Disney put out its first full-length trailer for A Wrinkle in Time this week, and more than anything, it’s a look at the incredible worlds that Ava DuVernay’s film will venture through. The film’s landscapes look colorful, magical, and filled with strange creatures, and they seem like they could be a lot more interesting to explore than many of the sci-fi worlds we’ve revisited time and again. The film comes out March 9th.

Phantom Thread

Here’s another short teaser for Paul Thomas Anderson’s next film. It’s brief, but every second of it looks gorgeous. The film comes out on Christmas.

El Camino Christmas

Netflix has a new Christmas movie coming up about some people being held hostage in a convenience store. Inexplicably, Jessica Alba and Tim Allen are in it. I don’t know what’s happening anymore. It comes out December 8th.

The Final Year

HBO has a new documentary coming up that goes inside the Obama Administration during its last 12 months in office. The film seems to get a surprisingly intimate, behind-the-scenes look at a lot of the administration’s leaders, and at least from this trailer, it seems like a fascinating recognition of the humanity that lies behind the enormous policy decisions a president has to make. It’s also a nice reminder of what a functional executive branch looks like. The film comes out January 19th.

The Mercy

This trailer makes The Mercy seem a little saccharine and overly heartwarming, but the story behind this film is pretty fascinating. It’s about Donald Crowhurst, who in 1968 set off on a round-the-world boat race without any real training and then began falsifying his logs to make it look like he had taken the lead in the race. The film is directed by James Marsh, whose documentary Man on Wire takes a look at another man on a fool-headed and potentially deadly mission; although I think this movie’s vibe is a lot more like Marsh’s uplifting The Theory of Everything. The film comes out February 9th in the UK, but there doesn’t seem to be a US release planned just yet.

Dieter Bohn,Amazon’s Black Friday stock surge pushed him over,2017-11-24T22:53:37Z,the-verge,Jeff Bezos’ net worth surpasses 100 billion dollars,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/24/16697520/jeff-bezos-net-worth-100-billion-dollars-amazon,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3_blBMSbunIiikgV9pJXZ2ofrk=/0x368:5136x3057/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9746021/813884326.jpg.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Bloomberg has been keeping an eye on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ net worth and notes that today, for the first time, it has exceeded $100 billion. That’s 100,000,000,000 dollars. He was already definitively the richest person in the world after spending part of 2016 trading places with Bill Gates. Gates, by the way, was the last person to reach that stratospheric level of wealth, back in 1999.

Bezos’ fortune is swelling mainly because Amazon’s stock has been doing so well this year. It was a Black Friday Amazon stock price bump that pushed him over the 12-figure mark today. That stock bump was entirely justified, as one firm estimates that Amazon may have accounted for half of all online sales for Black Friday. Half.

Slivers of his net worth (to him) are being spent on expensive (to normal humans) things: $250 million on the Washington Post back in 2013. A billion dollars a year in stock to fund Blue Origin and its rockets. He converted a billion dollars worth of stock into cash earlier this month.

But at that stratospheric level of wealth, the kind of money that’s basically impossible to comprehend short of talking about national governmental budgets, you can’t avoid a simple question: how much will he give away and how? Bezos himself is clearly looking for an answer. This past June he asked Twitter for ideas on how to be a better philanthropist. His goal was to tackle problems “at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.”

As of this moment, there are nearly 50 thousand replies to Bezos’ tweet. Let’s just do some simple division to give you a sense of the scale of Bezos’ fortune right now. If he just split his money up between each of the 47,742 people who replied to his tweet, they’d each receive about 2.1 million dollars.","bill gates gates

Bryan Bishop,It’s time for the holidays and Will Smith fighting with orcs,2017-11-25T15:00:02Z,the-verge,"Everything coming to Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now in December",https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/25/16688070/netflix-amazon-prime-hbo-now-new-movies-tv-shows-december-2017,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gw5IRmD7TJmN9wiPoAbYRMXlEsE=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9731699/BRIGHT_Unit_16520r1_2040.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"We’re about to enter the final weeks of 2017, and we’re all going to have to do something while waiting for Star Wars: The Last Jedi to come out. Sitting down to watch something from your streaming service of choice would seem to be a good option— but if you’re assuming there’s going to be an influx of treacly, holiday-themed specials, you’d be wrong. Instead, December is a month when a bunch of things you might actually want to watch are suddenly going to be available.

Netflix is kicking things off with some big names, including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the second season of the service’s Emmy-winning show The Crown, and its latest drama, Dark. And if you really insist on some sort of literal holiday tie-in, the Santa Clause franchise is also coming to Netflix. (But come on. You’re better than that.) Perhaps the most exciting addition is going to be Bright, the service’s big-budget fantasy action epic from Will Smith and director David Ayer. There’s been a lot of conversation about whether Netflix’s online-only strategy can actually work when it comes to tentpole movies, and Bright is one of the first titles it’s betting on.

Amazon Prime, on the other hand, is keeping things relatively low-key. S. Craig Zahler’s riveting Brawl in Cell Block 99 will be arriving on December 31st, but the service will also be adding movies like It Comes at Night, Nightcrawler, Silence of the Lambs, and James Cameron’s Titanic. (Say what you will about that last one, but it can be a fantastic way to distract family members for several hours during the holidays.)

Given that end-of-the-year schedules are so busy, HBO Now can probably be forgiven for its relatively thin additions next month. While it will be adding The Newspaperman: The Life and Times of Ben Bradlee, and the Kit Harington miniseries Gunpowder, it’s also including films like the director’s cuts of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Gone in 60 Seconds, and Daredevil. But perhaps the most important thing to note about HBO is what it will be losing on December 31st. Films like Tron, Watchmen, Highlander, and Her will all vanish at the end of the month, so you know where you should putting your attention. The complete list of titles is below.

Laura Hudson,Better get up early,2017-11-24T19:49:42Z,the-verge,The Super NES Classic is back at Best Buy on Saturday in limited quantities,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/24/16697012/super-nes-classic-in-stock,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pexNwkwRGg3fZIipp6ps5zzYL1U=/0x86:1200x714/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9745295/snes_classic.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Since its initial release in late September, it hasn’t been easy to get a hold of the Super NES Classic, a miniature version of the beloved 1990s Nintendo console that comes loaded with 21 games. The initial preorders were available only to customers who happened to be awake in the wee hours of the morning, and despite Nintendo’s promises to manufacture “significantly more” stock than they did of the NES Classic, the $79.99 retro console sold out quickly in stores.

But this Black Friday weekend comes with a sliver of hope for SNES fans who have been deprived of this tiny nugget of nostalgia, or at least fans in driving distance of a Best Buy. The retailer has announced it has limited quantities of the SNES Classic, which will go on sale at 9 am in more than a thousand Best Buy locations around the country.

“The Super NES Classic Edition will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis,” Best Buy says. “Our stores will offer a ticketing process before we open for customers waiting in line – the same ticketing process we’ll offer for the Saturday doorbuster deals. We will only pass out as many tickets as we have systems available, with a limit of one per customer. Super NES Classic Edition will not be available on BestBuy.com.”

The Super NES Classic plugs directly into any HD TV, and includes games like Super Mario World, Super Mario Kart and Super Metroid, as well as the previously unreleased Star Fox 2. If you want one, get there early—these limited supplies are likely to evaporate as quickly as people can get their hands on them.","super nes classic

Alessandra Potenza,‘It’s a tool to democratize access to coral reefs.’,2017-11-25T14:00:02Z,the-verge,These 3D maps of coral reefs may help us save them,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/25/16687372/coral-reefs-3d-maps-photomosaics-scripps-institute-palmyra-atoll-100-islands-challenge,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IuX1vZXJ64YxDtY0SINa99T1qHQ=/10x0:1421x739/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9737607/3D_map_still_image.png,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"There’s plenty of research about coral reefs bleaching and dying because of warming ocean waters — but one group of researchers is more interested in knowing how corals live and grow. To do that, they’re creating 3D visualizations of coral reefs around the world.

One of these coral reefs is at Palmyra Atoll, an island south of Hawaii. Every year, scientists go back to the island armed with underwater cameras and scuba diving gear. They take thousands of photos of the corals, covering an area of more than 17,000 square feet. In the lab, the photos are then stitched together to create 3D maps that allow researchers to revisit the reef in the comfort of their offices, time traveling from year to year to observe how corals change.

“When you put the headset on and you’re in one of these 3D models, it’s literally better than scuba diving,” says Clinton Edwards, a graduate student at Scripps. You don’t have to worry about the oxygen tank, the ocean currents, or getting sunburnt, he says. Computer software can also quickly scan the 3D maps and identify all the different coral species.

Edwards and other researchers analyzed one of these photomosaics of Palmyra Atoll and recently published their findings: the corals in this reef tend to cluster together, especially those that are more fragile, they found. That’s because when strong waves come and break the corals apart, the leftover bits and pieces can attach themselves to the rock and keep growing. That allows the corals to weather storms and survive, says study co-author Stuart Sandin, a professor of marine ecology at Scripps.

Understanding how corals are distributed within a reef — why certain corals are grouped together and some aren’t — is key to protecting coral reefs. The same information on land can help people manage forests: thanks to photographs taken by airplanes and satellites, scientists have been studying individual trees in forests for years, Sandin says. Understanding where trees live and grow, and how far apart from each other they are, for instance, helps forestry managers keep forests healthy. But reefs are obviously underwater, so the same type of information is basically non-existent.

Sandin hopes that creating the 3D photomosaics can help change that. The Palmyra Atoll is part of the 100 Island Challenge, a group of researchers around the world who are taking photos and creating 3D visualizations of reefs on 100 islands, from Palau to Antigua. By comparing the same reefs year to year, and comparing reefs to each other, the researchers hope to better understand how corals are structured, where and how they grow, how they die — and what makes them resilient to environmental changes. This information is key if we want to save coral reefs from dying. If we want to replant reefs, for instance, we have to know how the reefs are organized.

This first paper, published in Coral Reefs, is starting to answer some of these questions. Next, the researchers want to compare data from 2012 to 2016 in order to get a better understanding of how individual corals changed through time, including how they reacted to the worldwide 2015-2016 massive bleaching event.

Sandin says he hopes that the visualizations will become available through VR headsets, similarly to what NOAA is doing, so that people can virtually swim through the reefs. In the meantime, you can watch the 3D maps on YouTube. “It’s a tool to democratize access to coral reefs,” Sand says. “It’s an ability to share coral reefs to allow people to travel different places and learn from different places.”","clinton edwards

Andrew Liptak,Worth the 17 year wait,2017-11-25T16:30:02Z,the-verge,Philip Pullman’s The Book of Dust is a conflicting but rewarding fantasy adventure,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/25/16640892/book-of-dust-la-belle-sauvag-philip-pullman-fantasy-book-review,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KbyHgs2K2K5AT5ghvxfDA0diOo=/0x144:2040x1212/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9687879/aliptak_171030_2103_0002.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"It’s been 17 years since Philip Pullman finished off his celebrated fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials. In trilogy’s first installment, The Golden Compass, he introduced readers to Lyra Belacqua, a girl from a parallel world, who sets off to rescue a missing friend. It was an uncompromising story about religion, authority, and individual freedom that earned acclaim around the world. Now, Pullman has recently released his long-awaited followup, The Book of Dust. The first volume, La Belle Sauvage, acts as a prequel to the original trilogy, and while it doesn’t quite live up to those novels, it’s still a story worth the long wait.

The world of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust is one like ours, but just a little different: every human is linked to their own dæmon, an animal-shaped manifestation of their soul. The Golden Compass (or The Northern Lights, if you’re in England), depicts a world ruled by an oppressive church known as the Magisterium that Lyra must challenge when she sets off to find her kidnapped friend Roger. La Belle Sauvage is set a decade before that adventure, when Lyra is just an infant.

In her place, we’re introduced to Malcolm Polstead, a bright eleven-year-old who helps his parents at their Oxford pub, The Trout. He’s a smart, curious child, who clashes with Alice, an abrasive teenager who also works at the pub, and spends his time on the river in his canoe, which he named La Belle Sauvage. Two things set him on his journey: While at the pub, he overhears news that the local nuns have taken in an infant — Lyra — the daughter of two powerful figures: a man named Lord Asriel and a woman named Marisa Coulter. The next day, he sees a man arrested, and later finds an item that the man lost: a brass acorn with a message hidden inside.

The acorn is used as a way to covertly deliver messages to a local scholar who has access to an alethiometer, a truth-divining tool that figured prominently in Pullman’s previous trilogy. It connects Malcolm with the scholar, Hannah Relf, who belongs to a covert anti-Magisterium government agency known as Oakley Street. Both the church and a disgraced scientist named Gerard Bonneville seem strangely interested in Lyra, and when a massive flood overtakes Oxford, Malcolm and Alice spirit Lyra away from the rising waters and encroaching agents of the Magisterium.

Pullman uses effective, blunt-force imagery to show the rise of a fascist government

A decade later in The Golden Compass, the Magisterium has established an oppressive control on society, stamping out ideas that it deems heretical. The church isn’t as powerful in this book, but it’s well on its way. Pullman uses effective, blunt-force imagery to show how the Magisterium is tightening its grip on society. Its security force, the Consistorial Court of Discipline (CCD), assassinates, assaults, and otherwise makes dissidents vanish, while it introduces a youth-oriented group to Malcolm’s school called the The League of St. Alexander, which encourages his classmates to report potentially heretical actions of their peers or parents.

Fantastical fascist movements aren’t anything new to YA fantasy literature, and the League is a group that reminded me quite a bit of the Inquisitorial Squad from J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Teachers who object are reprimanded or fired. But despite peer pressure, Malcolm resists the group’s recruitment efforts, taking solace in his own activities and routines with his dæmon Asta, and when Malcolm and Alice flee with Lyra in their arms, they’re pursued by the members of the CCD and the League.

A story about battling a rising tide of fascism feels timely as alt-right groups spring up across the world and authoritarian strongmen claim political power, and La Belle Sauvage plays this story out in a tense, thrilling manner. But Pullman largely abandons this setup in the second half of the novel, where Malcolm and Alice are on the run with Lyra. Pullman presents a fairy tale-like journey to bring Lyra to her father, where they encounter ancient, mythical creatures such as Old Father Thames and a malevolent fairy. Pullman uses Bonneville, who seems to want Lyra as leverage to get back into the Magisterium’s good graces, to drive the tension, but it’s a puzzling inclusion. While he is a genuinely terrifying character, Malcolm’s resistance against the church and its agents felt as though it has more resonance with the His Dark Materials trilogy, while Bonneville’s actions are far more chaotic.

La Belle Sauvage is also torn between two competing directions

Pullman’s characters begin to break down as well. Alice has a unique voice and become an an engaging character once she and Malcolm become friends, but Pullman largely uses her as a prop with which to boost up Malcolm, while Dr. Relf essentially vanishes from the narrative altogether. (She does appear in The Amber Spyglass, and presumably, we’ll see her in the next installment of the trilogy). This is disappointing, because Pullman is a master storyteller. His characters in His Dark Materials are exquisitely crafted, and I can’t help but feel as though they fall a bit flat in comparison. La Belle Sauvage is also torn between two competing directions: the rise of fascism, and the theological exploration of the nature of Dust, the particle discovered by Bonneville that helps explain consciousness, and which becomes a prominent part of the His Dark Materials trilogy. While these two elements seem like they ought to connect, they never quite mesh, and as a result, the book feels a bit scattered.

What holds the narrative together is Malcolm himself: a bright, curious boy who is as engaging as Lyra was in His Dark Materials. Pullman has been saying that this new trilogy is neither a prequel nor a sequel, but an equal to those books, and the same language can be applied to Malcolm. He might be different from Lyra, but he’s every bit as vibrant a hero. His journey is one of loyalty and courage: he transforms from a quiet child to a hero willing to take drastic, even violent measures to keep Lyra safe. Hopefully, he’ll be appearing in the next installment of the trilogy, which Pullman says will take place a decade after The Amber Spyglass. Despite its unfocused nature, Pullman is still an excellent storyteller, and La Belle Sauvage is certainly worth the nearly two decades that we’ve waited for it. But just as importantly, it’s a book that feels like a natural part of the His Dark Materials saga, and more likely than not, it’ll have me revisiting those books while I wait for the next installment, The Secret Commonwealth.","roger la belle sauvage

White House senior adviser Jared Kushner listens as President Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Nov. 1. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

A month ago, Jared Kushner — President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser — made a surprise trip to Riyadh to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the fellow son of a world leader who is making waves with crackdowns and modernization efforts.

Kushner, 36, flew commercial, and the White House only announced the visit once he was already on the ground. There were no news releases touting the specifics of his meetings, which included two days of one-on-one and small private audiences with Salman, 32. White House officials said the trip was part of Kushner’s effort as Trump’s adviser to build regional support for peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

Just days after Kushner landed back in Washington, Salman launched a purge of allegedly corrupt Saudi officials also seen as rivals to the prince and his father, King Salman. Kushner had no knowledge or advance warning of the move, and the topic was not natural for the two to discuss, a White House official close to him said. “Jared’s portfolio is Israeli-Palestinian peace, and he respects what his lane is,” the official said.

The journey revealed Kushner as a figure who seems both near the center of power and increasingly marginalized at the same time. His once-sprawling White House portfolio, which came with walk-in privileges to the Oval Office, has been diminished to its original scope under Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, and he has notably receded from public view.

His still-evolving role in the investigations of Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice also make him a potential risk to President Trump, even as he enjoys the special status of being married to the boss’s daughter, Ivanka, and serving as one of the president’s senior confidants. Kushner’s family faces additional pressures over a troubled New York skyscraper at 666 Fifth Ave., which he purchased in his role as head of his family’s real estate business but from which he has divested since entering the administration.

[Kushner redevelopment plan for 666 Fifth Ave. deemed ‘not feasible’ by partner]

In a rare interview in his West Wing office earlier this month — a silver bowl of Halloween candy still on the table — Kushner offered his own version of the fable of the fox, who knows many things, and the hedgehog, who knows one important thing.

“During the campaign, I was more like a fox than a hedgehog. I was more of a generalist having to learn about and master a lot of skills quickly,” he said. “When I got to D.C., I came with an understanding that the problems here are so complex — and if they were easy problems, they would have been fixed before — and so I became more like the hedgehog, where it was more taking issues you care deeply about, going deep and devoting the time, energy and resources to trying to drive change.”

This portrait of Kushner comes from interviews with Kushner himself, as well as 12 senior administration officials, aides, outside advisers and confidants, some of them speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a more candid assessment.

Allies say Kushner’s subtle shift into the background of the West Wing reflects his natural inclination to work hard and eschew the limelight. His enemies gloat that it stems from avoidable missteps that resulted from his political naivete.

Following recent reports, which the White House denied, that the president privately blames Kushner for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s widening probe, ­Breitbart, the conservative website, snarkily dubbed him “Mr. Perfect.” The nickname originated from promotional material Kushner’s own family used, when trying to lure Chinese investors to their New Jersey real estate projects.

Some aides scoff at the notion that Kushner isn’t still whispering to the president about official business. But one of Kelly’s conditions for taking the job was that everyone, including Kushner and his wife, had to go through him to reach the president, and Kelly has made clear that Kushner reports to him, aides said.

The new hierarchy is part of Kelly’s effort to sideline Kushner, said one Republican in frequent contact with the White House. Others say the order Kelly imposed has simply liberated Kushner to focus on his own portfolio — and eased some of the animosity his colleagues felt toward him.

[Enforcer or ‘choke point’? Kelly seeks to bring order to chaotic White House]

Kushner said he welcomes the change. “The order allows this place to function,” Kushner said. “My number one priority is a high-functioning White House because I believe in the president’s agenda, and I think it should get executed.”

He still maintains the broad portfolio he took on at the beginning of the administration that made him a punchline among aides on Capitol Hill: peace in the Middle East; matters regarding Canada, Mexico and China; and the Office of American Innovation, an in-house group that focuses on tackling longer-term government challenges.

He attends meetings of his innovation group once a week, often on a Tuesday or Wednesday for an hour-long check-in and progress update. The innovation office launched with great fanfare in March, but some aides recently said they could not pinpoint exactly what it has accomplished.

Kushner and his allies reject that assessment, saying the office is focused on long-term projects. They say, for example, that the group helped the Department of Veterans Affairs launch their electronic medical records initiative in June, with Kushner expediting the process by calling Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and asking him to send people from his department to help.

“If I ever get into a roadblock, we just elevate it to Jared,” said Chris Liddell, a senior White House official who works in the innovation office. “He’s great at saying, ‘Can’t we get so-and-so to come over?’ And we get it done on the spot.”

Kushner is one of the advisers helping on negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he accompanied Trump on the first half of his Asia trip earlier this month.

[Analysis: Jared Kushner’s quest for peace looks increasingly doomed]

But the main focus for Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, is working to bring peace to the Middle East — a task that has bedeviled negotiators far more experienced in the region for generations. What Kushner brings to the effort, say several senior White House officials, is personal relationships with players on all sides and a willingness to bet on long-shot outcomes.

Before Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Trump at the White House in September, Kushner and Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt met him at the Mandarin Oriental for a two-hour breakfast. More recently, on Halloween, Kushner suggested that he and Greenblatt visit Saeb Erekat, the lead Palestinian peace negotiator, at the apartment in Virginia where he is recuperating from a lung transplant. After briefly considering, and then nixing, wine — Erekat is Muslim — Kushner ultimately brought chocolate.

“This is very much a human conflict and a human-to-human relationship,” Greenblatt said. “When you’re able to touch somebody and talk about it, it’s a meaningful engagement. It takes a certain personality, and Jared has that touch.”

Yet snags persist. A week ago, the Palestinians threatened to freeze all contact with the Trump administration after the State Department said the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office in Washington could not remain open — a decision it backtracked on Friday.

And Kushner’s friendship with Mohammed bin Salman raised questions after the crown prince’s anti-corruption campaign — which critics paint as an attempt to consolidate power but devotees say is part of his efforts as a reformer — as well as concerns from some that Saudi Arabia now feels further emboldened within the region.

The Mueller probe, meanwhile, is entering a new phase, with the special counsel announcing three indictments at the end of last month — including for Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort — while investigators begin to interview people close to the president’s inner circle. Kushner has turned over documents to the House and Senate committees investigating possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign, although in a letter, the Senate Judiciary Committee recently complained that Kushner had not been fully forthcoming — a charge his lawyer denies.

So far, Mueller has filed no court documents to suggest Kushner is in legal jeopardy, but people close to the case say investigators have been looking at his meetings with Russians before and after the election, as well as his role in discussions that led to the firing of FBI director James B. Comey.

The news on Thanksgiving that former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s lawyers notified Trump’s legal team that they could no longer share information about the Russia probe prompted speculation that Flynn may now be cooperating with Mueller — a potentially perilous sign for the president and his associates.

But friends say Kushner is even-keeled about the investigations. For him, they said, the most stressful moments came in May, amid news reports that he had tried to establish a secret back channel with Russia during the transition and that the FBI was probing his actions. He was frustrated, a White House official said, that he couldn’t respond to the allegations until he went to be interviewed by Congress.

[When the Trump campaign and Russian actors overlapped]

“Jared is an extraordinarily calm person,” said H.R. McMaster, the White House national security adviser. “I have never seen him distracted.”

He huddled with his lawyers for hours in the run-up to his testimony before Congress but is in less frequent daily contact now unless something from Mueller’s probe specifically requires his attention, one White House official said.

Kushner’s detractors point to his role in the Russia probe as another sign of his poor political skills and continued risk to the president. A Republican close to the White House said Kushner “has no judgment — never has and never will.”

But in some ways, Kushner appears more protected from the daily sniping that plagued the early months of Trump’s presidency. Over the summer, a trio of advisers who were rivals to Kushner were pushed out of the West Wing: Stephen K. Bannon, then the president’s chief strategist, who now runs Breitbart; Reince Priebus, the chief of staff; and Sean Spicer, the press secretary.

“He no longer is in an environment where he has an actual predator,” said one White House official, likening Kushner to Bannon’s regular prey. “That has probably helped his working environment some.”

Kushner, with his whispery voice, has also proved one of the few people adept at absorbing Trump’s anger. He can speak to Trump in a shared language of transaction from their days in the New York real estate world.

“I don’t try to manage him,” Kushner said. “I try to give him my honest feedback. If he asks my advice on something, sometimes I’ll give it, sometimes I’ll say, ‘Let me go call a few people,’ and then I’ll give it.”

[‘A long winter’: White House aides divided over scope, risks of Russia probe]

McMaster said Kushner sometimes acts as a translator between the president and his senior advisers. “He helped a lot of us learn faster what’s important to the president,” McMaster said. “His relationship with the president makes Jared valuable as an adviser to the president, and also as an adviser to the president’s advisers.”

When Kushner’s family first arrived in Washington, they agreed they would assess after six months whether they intended to stay. Trump himself has mused privately about the hit his daughter and son-in-law’s reputation is taking because of their White House roles and about what a great and easy life they had back in New York. Others have questioned why someone like Kushner would put himself in Mueller’s crosshairs by remaining in government.

But when the couple reassessed in July, they reached a decision. “We’re here to stay,” Kushner said. “At the current moment, we’re charging forward.”

He added, “My wife asked me the other day if we should be looking at new houses, so that’s a good sign.”","jabin botsfordthe washington post kushner

"Amber Phillips, Amber Phillips","Trump's critics, like Sen. Jeff Flake, certainly think so.",2017-11-25T13:00:00Z,the-washington-post,Analysis | Could the battle for the GOP’s soul leave Republicans unelectable?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/11/25/could-the-battle-for-the-gops-soul-leave-republicans-unelectable/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/15/National-Politics/Images/814626826.jpg?t=20170517,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"""We are in trouble as a party if we continue to follow both Roy Moore and Donald Trump.”

That was Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) Monday, doubling down on something he said on a hot mic last weekend: That if the Republican Party becomes “the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast.”

What Flake said publicly is what Republican leaders are stressing over privately. They fear Trump is taking the party in a direction that could make it unelectable.

Of course, Trump would argue that he's taking the party in the right direction.

Sen. Jeff Flake(y), who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite President. He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017

What's not up for debate is that, for better or for worse, the ground the GOP rests upon is shifting underneath Republicans' feet, and the battle is on for which side will ultimately lay claim to it.

Here are five ways that battle is manifesting right now:

1. Primaries, primaries, primaries: Senate Republicans should have a lot of pickup opportunities in next year's midterm elections, when 10 Senate Democrats are up for reelection in states that Trump won in 2016.

But Republicans first have to get through competitive primaries in nearly every state, including for seats the GOP already holds. Fighting each other for seats was not in the establishment's game plan.

Some of these competitive primaries came into being by Trump's gravitational pull. In the swing-state of Nevada, endangered Sen. Dean Heller (R) has to beat a pro-Trump challenger before he can even think about reelection. Same in Arizona, which is one reason Flake stepped down. (More on that in a minute.)

[The top 10 Senate races of 2018]

2. The decline of establishment power: Senate Republican leaders want Moore to drop out of next month's special election in Alabama to fill the seat Attorney General Jeff Sessions vacated. Now. Better to lose a Senate seat than serve alongside someone accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls.

But Moore is still in it, with the president's blessing, no less.

President Trump on Nov. 21 did not rescind his support for Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Alabama. Trump criticized Doug Jones, Moore's Democratic opponent. (The Washington Post)

This is just one high-profile example of the GOP establishment leadership's slipping power. For the past several years, campaigning against the power structure in Washington has been a winning argument, said Doug Heye, a GOP consultant.

A candidates' playbook looks something like: “Attack GOP leadership, raise money,” Heye said. That has cost the GOP establishment in reputation and leverage.

3. The rise of more controversial candidates: The establishment GOP leadership once thought it had a different insurgency, the tea party movement, under control. Until interim Sen. Luther Strange lost to Moore in Alabama this fall, the Republican establishment hadn't lost a primary in five years.

They lost Alabama, and they could lose more primaries next year, which could cost them general elections. Trump's former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has said he wants to try to challenge nearly every GOP senator up for reelection in the 2018 midterms.

Thought there's no evidence Bannon can do that, there is a ton of evidence that when far-right candidates win primaries, they are prone to spectacular downfalls in the general elections.

Democrats won key Senate races in Missouri and Indiana in 2012 because Republican voters elected flawed candidates who said controversial things about rape. Now, there's a growing chance Democrats could pick up a Senate seat, in Alabama of all places, because Republicans there nominated Moore.



(Philip Bump / The Washington Post)

[How to argue about the brewing war between Steve Bannon and Mitch McConnell]

4. Swing groups are souring on the president: Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency is lower than any president in the history of polling. And a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll finds majorities in crucial swing groups — white women with college degrees, moderates and independents — don't like him.

If these critical voters are so turned off by Trump, Republicans up for election next year may have to decide they need to be critical of the president, too, if they want to win.

We got a glimpse of these key demographics trend away from Republicans in Virginia's state elections earlier this month. In the hotly contested governor's race, exit polls showed women voted for the Democrat by a 22-point margin, five points more than they voted for Hillary Clinton a year earlier. Independents also voted for the Democrat for governor by a larger margin than they voted for Clinton.

5. Jeff Flake himself: Some Republicans up for reelection may have to ditch Trump to keep their jobs.

The opposite happened to Flake. He quit his job to ditch Trump. “I will not be complicit,” Flake said in a shocking retirement announcement on the Senate floor last month.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said on Oct. 24 that he will not seek reelection in 2018. Here is the full speech he delivered on the Senate floor. (U.S. Senate)

But as Flake himself acknowledged, Arizona Republican voters seem to feel differently. Polls showed Flake would struggle to win a primary against his pro-Trump challenger, and Flake chose to retire rather than run for reelection in a losing effort.

“The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I'm not willing to take, and that I can't in good conscience take,” he told the Arizona Republic.

The end of Flake's own career is a microcosm of the Republican Party's breakup: Republicans are in a battle for the soul of their party. And it's not clear (yet) which side will ultimately claim it.

But as Flake voiced this week, plenty of establishment Republicans are terrified that Trump could be winning.

Andy Sullivan reports. (Reuters)

Republicans are pushing full steam ahead on their tax cut plan, despite polling that shows more Americans oppose rather than support the sweeping proposal to reduce corporate rates and some individual tax bills.

In pushing so hard, Republicans are betting they can sell this plan to the skeptical public once the legislation is signed into law by President Trump and workers see a boost in take-home pay. They are not dismissive of the polling, but they believe they can make the legislation popular enough next year to save their congressional majorities in the midterm elections.

“I fundamentally believe when we do this — make good on our word, make good on our promise, make people’s lives better — we’re going to be just fine politically,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters the week before the House passed its tax-cut plan Nov. 16.

One can almost hear the echo of a previous House speaker pushing legislation in the early days of a new administration, as the proposal and the president started to grow unpopular.

“We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it,” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), then the House speaker and now minority leader, said before final passage of the Affordable Care Act.

All your major questions about the House GOP tax plan, answered

Pelosi’s opponents accused Democrats of approving a major law without ever reading it, taking her words out of context. What Pelosi was trying to say was quite similar to what Ryan is now saying: Once the law is passed and the public sees its impact, voters will like its benefits.

Instead, opponents branded the ACA as “Obamacare,” and it remained unpopular for most of Barack Obama’s presidency. In December 2009, after the House approved its version and the Senate was gearing up for a Christmas Eve vote, just 44 percent of voters supported the health proposal, and 51 percent opposed it, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

The GOP tax proposal is slightly less popular at almost the same stage of the process: Just 33 percent of adults support Trump’s tax plan while 50 percent oppose it, according to this month’s Post-ABC News poll.

Support for the ACA barely moved ahead of the 2010 elections, and Democrats lost the House majority in a 63-seat blowout.

In 2016, Obama’s last year in office, the public began to appreciate the health law. By August of this year, after Republicans failed in their bid to repeal the law, 52 percent of voters supported the ACA and 39 percent opposed it, according to a Kaiser Health Tracking Poll.

Republicans can take some solace in that groundswell of ACA support, showing how the public can warm up to previously unpopular laws. The question for Republicans is whether, if they pass their tax plan, they can convince the public that it was a good thing to do in time for next year’s elections.

Democrats are driving home that the relief for corporate tax rates, from 35 percent down to 20 percent, is permanent, while the lower rates for individuals expire after 10 years. “Republicans are openly looting the hard-earned income of the American middle class to hand tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent and corporations,” Pelosi said.

To counter that charge, Republicans have been circulating data, polling and focus group feedback to win back the public on a traditional GOP issue. The key moves are talking about workers seeing more money in their paychecks and not focusing on large macroeconomic theory.

“As a stand-alone, tax reform is a moderate priority, but in its ability to impact the economy, jobs and wages, it is a huge priority,” David Winston and Myra Miller, co-founders of the Winston Group, a Republican polling firm, wrote in a July memo.

Several of these Winston Group memos, sent to congressional leaders and K Street allies, were provided to The Washington Post by recipients who have been sharing the firm’s work to lawmakers unsteady in their support to shore up their vote and help them explain their decision to constituents.

Leader of key GOP super PAC warns lawmakers: Oppose tax bill at your peril

Republicans also believe taxes and the economy are a better issue set. In the Winston memo, voters chose Republicans by eight percentage points over Democrats to handle the economy and by four points on taxes, while Democrats held a margin of 12 percent on health care.

Also, there is a political imperative to deliver results, given how frustrated conservatives are with the lack of output so far. Most House Republicans represent less affluent, somewhat rural districts where the vast majority of workers do not itemize their taxes. That means lower rates would benefit constituents in deep-red districts because the elimination of other deductions will not hit them.

For Republicans fearing a primary challenge, this tax plan is something to sell to conservative voters. “They need to put a product on the table,” said former congressman Thomas M. Davis III, who served as the House Republican campaign chief from 1999 to 2003.

But the proposed elimination or reduction of some deductions, particularly state and local taxes, hurts in the suburbs. Several dozen of the most targeted Republicans represent wealthy suburban districts where quite a few of those constituents will see a net tax hike.

“The people that itemize are the swing voters,” Davis said.

Some Republicans are urging lawmakers to focus on other proposals inside the massive legislation. “In the immediate term, it will deliver tangible relief — in doubling the standard deduction, lowering rates and increasing the child tax credit — to middle-class families,” said Michael Steel, a former House GOP leadership aide working with an outside coalition supporting the proposal.

Yet during the 2009-2010 push for the ACA, when Steel worked for John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), then the minority leader, Republicans successfully defined the proposal for many voters as a government takeover of the health industry. Other popular provisions — allowing children to stay on a parent’s plan until age 26, ensuring coverage for preexisting conditions — could not overcome the general disdain toward the ACA.

Eight years later, Pelosi and Democrats are working overtime to do to the tax plan what Republicans did to the ACA.

Ryan is adamant that, once the bill is signed into law, voters will like what they see.

“This is not unpopular. We’re actually letting people keep more of their own money,” Ryan told reporters, citing the benefits to come. “That's not an unpopular thing to do.”

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

It has been a long and unproductive year for President Trump. Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act cratered. The wall on the U.S.-Mexico border hasn’t been built or even funded. Tax reform, though moving forward, is still well short of a Rose Garden signing ceremony. Despite unified Republican control of government, Trump’s got little to show for it.

Yet it has also been a long and quite productive year for the president. He has dramatically changed the direction of federal policy toward the environment, the energy industries, immigration, education, civil rights, trade and the federal workforce, and he is rapidly remaking the federal court system. What President Barack Obama started in many of these areas, Trump has started to reverse.

The president’s tweets draw outsize attention to his grievances and his petty feuds. The absence of notable legislative successes focuses criticism on his style of leadership. Those realities overshadow what he has done and is doing unilaterally, to the extent of his executive powers. In other ways, his presidency seems unique. In the arena of executive action, he is pursuing a model established by his recent past predecessors, with worrisome consequences to constitutional governance.

That’s the conclusion of an essay in the most recent issue of the Forum, a nonpartisan journal of ideas and political analysis. Sidney M. Milkis and Nicholas Jacobs, both of the University of Virginia, argue that Trump’s deployment of what they call “executive-centered partisanship” is both in keeping with the modern presidency and a potentially damaging shift in our politics.

The authors take note of Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, where he said that he, an outsider, knew better than anyone how to solve the problems of broken government. “Nobody knows the system better than me,” he said. “Which is why I alone can fix it.”

The first year of his presidency appears to make a mockery of that statement, given the problems he’s had in Congress and the fact that his approval ratings are the lowest of any president at this point in his term as far back as there was polling.

Yet, as the authors note, “Often overlooked among the disappointments and recriminations of Trump’s frenzied beginning is his administration’s aggressive and deliberate assault on the Liberal state. . . . Since day one, Trump has forcefully — and sometimes successfully — taken aim at the programmatic achievements of his predecessor.”

Milkis and Jacobs contend that this approach to governing has its roots in presidencies dating back decades. The consequence is the evolution of a “presidency-centered and rancorous contest between liberals and conservatives” with all kinds of collateral damage to Congress, the states, and public trust and confidence in government overall.

They argue that this has produced a politics that is “no longer a struggle over the size of the state” but instead is a contest between liberals and conservatives “to seize and deploy the state and its resources.”

Former presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used these powers to advance conservative objectives. Obama, the authors note, campaigned as someone who would move the nation past mindless bickering to a post-partisan presidency but in office, particularly as his frustrations with a Republican-controlled Congress intensified, fully embraced the use of vigorous executive action for political and partisan ends.

“Most of his executive actions were directed to strengthening a widely scattered but potentially powerful coalition that had been forming since the Great Society: minorities, youth, the LGBTQ community and educated white voters, especially single women,” according to the authors.

Though the goals of Obama’s and Trump’s uses of executive action are diametrically opposed politically, the authors contend that the two presidents share two things in common: “a detachment from party organization and a vision of the White House as the vanguard of a movement.”

Trump has lacked a clear legislative strategy from the start of his presidency. He had no well-developed policy proposals to offer Congress, he lacked interest in learning the details of key legislation such as health care, he has shown limited interest in using the bully pulpit to advocate the GOP’s legislative priorities, and, though he has spent considerable time talking with legislators, he has not demonstrated that he is the kind of dealmaker he claimed he would be.

In the arena of executive action, however, he has pursued goals consistent with his campaign rhetoric — and, like Obama, priorities designed to appeal directly to his own political coalition.

Some actions hew closely to conventional conservative Republican doctrine. Others reflect his “America First” perspective and a suspicion of what former adviser Stephen K. Bannon called the “deep state” of the federal bureaucracy. At times, he has pursued actions that concern some elements of the traditional Republican coalition. At other times, he is acting in pursuit of the goals of that coalition.

There can be no final accounting of success or failure in this arena, given the short time Trump has been in office and the obstacles that exist in the face of a president attempting to act unilaterally.

So far, the record is mixed. Trump has moved policy in a different direction, but Milkis and Jacobs write that, in the immediate term, his actions seem to have “fostered a destructive working arrangement in the White House Office, the hollowing out of regular departments and agencies and limited his support to conservative Republicans who represent roughly 40 percent of the electorate.”

The authors close with a note of warning. What began in other presidencies has become “a glaring alarm during Trump’s presidency.” That is the “false illusion” that the executive “can truly function as a representative democratic institution.” Instead, they say, executive partisanship exposes the public to “leaders who scorn institutional restraints that are a vital ingredient of constitutional government” as well as the collaboration that long has been at the core of party politics.

The president and Congress face a busy and potentially fateful month of legislative conflict, which will legitimately be the focus of attention through the end of the year. But no one should lose sight of the unilateral action at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue that has been every bit as defining in the record of Trump’s presidency.","jupiter alex brandonap buy photo wait

The White House is preparing for a showdown over who will be the next leader of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a high-stakes battle that could end up in court and slow President Trump’s effort to roll back banking industry regulations.

Leadership of the agency was thrown into doubt on an otherwise slow holiday weekend after President Trump and the CFPB’s outgoing head both named acting directors to head the regulatory watchdog. On Friday, Trump named Mulvaney, a long-time critic of the agency, while Richard Cordray promoted his chief of staff, Leandra English, to deputy director and said she would become acting director.

Both sides appeared to be preparing for a fight Saturday, including wading into the fineprint of federal rules to bolster their position. On Saturday, senior administration officials said the White House’s position was supported by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The office is preparing to publish a written opinion supporting the appointment soon, but has already confirmed verbally and through email that it complies with the law, the officials said.

“We think the clear legal authority is that the president does have this authority. We’ll find out based on how Ms. English decides to act at the appropriate time,” one official said.

In a brief interview Saturday, Cordray disagreed. “The law authorized me to appoint a deputy director, and I did so. My understanding of the law is that the deputy director serves as the acting director upon my resignation. If there are disagreements about these issues, the appropriate place to settle them would be in the courts,” he said.

The battle, should it wind up in court, could turn into a roadblock to the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back financial regulations. While Trump has installed new leadership at the top of several other regulatory agencies, many of which have already taken a more business-friendly tone, the CFPB has continued to aggressively push rules that irked Wall Street. The agency has broad powers to regulate financial firms, from banks, credit card companies to payday lenders, and impose fines for wrongdoing.

The agency has often run afoul of conservatives for what the banking industry has complained is overly aggressive rulemaking. But it has been cheered by consumer advocates and Democrats for taking on big banks, including Wells Fargo, which it fined a record $100 million for opening millions of fake accounts customers didn’t ask for.

“It is unclear at this point who will be running the CFPB on Monday morning,” Isaac Boltansky, a Washington policy analyst for the investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading, said in a research note Saturday. “It appears that both Deputy Director English and OMB Director Mulvaney will walk in the door on Monday morning with the expectation of running the CFPB. We haven’t the faintest clue how that specific interaction will unfold, but our sense is that it could be a muddled mess.

The White House has not spoken to English but expects her to show up to work Monday — as deputy director, said administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mulvaney is working on a transition plan and will serve as the CFPB’s acting director until the Senate confirm a permanent replacement, they said. At the same time, he would remain as budget director.

“We don’t have any reason to think that anything out of the ordinary course will happen,” one senior administration said. “We think [Mulvaney] will show up Monday and he will go into the office and start working.”

The White House hopes to avoid a legal battle, but is confident that its appointment of Mulvaney will stand up to scrutiny, senior administration officials said in a call with reporters Saturday morning.

“We have gone out of our way to avoid an unnecessary legal battle with Mr. Cordray,” a senior administration official said. “His actions clearly indicate that he is trying to provoke one.”

The tug-of-war over the leadership of the agency is likely to linger for some time. Democrats and consumer advocates say Mulvaney’s appointment is illegal and are calling on the Trump administration to allow English to serve until a permanent replacement is confirmed by the Senate.

Trump “can nominate the next @CFPB Director – but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who helped establish the bureau and is one of its biggest supporters, said on Twitter.

Installing Mulvaney, even on a temporary basis, to lead the agency would quickly change its course. As a Republican congressman, Mulvaney called the CFPB a “joke . . . in a sick, sad way” and said it should be dissolved. Mulvaney’s experience running a large agency and time serving on the House Financial Services Committee qualified him for job, administration officials said.

Mulvaney’s appointment has already set off a wave of protest from consumer advocates who fear the former Republican House lawmaker would dismantle the agency. Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, compared Mulvaney’s potential leadership of the agency to installing a “wrecking ball.”

“It is no joke to ordinary families to attempt to defang the one agency in Washington with the tools and independence to take on the Wall Street banks, giant credit reporting agencies, and predatory lenders that abuse the American public,” she said in a statement.

The fight over the agency’s future began Friday when Cordray announced that he was stepping down at midnight, a week earlier than expected, and promoted English to deputy director. In a letter announcing his decision, Cordray cited a section of 2010’s Dodd-Frank Act that states a deputy director will “serve as acting director in the absence or unavailability of the director.”

[Richard Cordray dodges questions — again — about his political ambitions]

In addition to serving as CFPB’s chief of staff, English has been the agency’s deputy chief operating officer, the principal deputy chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management, chief of staff and senior adviser to the deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget. Her appointment will “ensure a smooth transition and operational stability at the agency,” Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.

The announcement was seen as a maneuver to delay a Trump administration takeover of the agency and a few hours later the White House named Mulvaney acting director. The president’s authority under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act supersedes the language in the Dodd-Frank legislation, administration officials said. Mulvaney’s appointment was “routine,” they said.

But one of the authors of Dodd-Frank, former representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.), disputed that the administration’s reading of the law. “It is obvious,” Frank said in an interview. Lawmakers would not have included the succession language in the Dodd Frank legislation if they intended for the Federal Vacancies Reform Act to supersede it, he said.

“If you look at the CFPB language it is very specific and it was designed to protect an agency that we knew would be under a lot of pressure,” said Frank. “This is an agency that enforces the rules against some of the most powerful financial interests in the country. Everything was structured for its independence.”","house financial services committee

The state-owned newspaper was forced this month to cover the downfall of Robert Mugabe, whose rule it had long applauded. (Kevin Sieff/The Washington Post)

For 37 years, it was the official newspaper of Robert Mugabe. Then, this month, the staff of the Zimbabwe Herald got an impossible assignment: They would have to cover the downfall of their benefactor.

In the days after Mugabe was detained by the military, editors and reporters gathered in a wood-paneled newsroom in an old office building downtown, trying to figure out what to do. Should they back Mugabe or the military takeover? Did they still have to echo the party line? What was the party line, anyway?

Suddenly, a newsroom that had been the mouthpiece of the regime was without a censor.

“In the past we could never criticize the president,” said Felex Share, a political reporter, in the hours before Mugabe’s resignation. “Right now, we can touch anything.”

The rapid descent of the world’s oldest head of state came as a shock to many Zimbabweans who assumed that Mugabe would rule the country until his death. The Herald, which is owned by the government, had advanced the idea that his rule was untouchable. Until two weeks ago, the paper was printing laudatory stories and editorials about the country’s despotic leader.

“President Mugabe deserves Nobel Peace Prize,” said one headline last month.

“He is undisputedly the most exceptional figure in the history of our country,” another article said in September.

The paper’s editors and reporters didn’t usually agree with those messages, but working for the Herald meant shelving your own politics. It was the best-paying newspaper in Zimbabwe, and in a country with a soaring unemployment rate, that meant something.

“It makes you feel stupid writing this stuff,” said Joram Nyathi, the paper’s deputy editor. “But you’re working for government media. You know what to expect.”

Even after Mugabe’s house arrest, the paper decided to play it safe. “Business as usual across the country,” its front-page headline said, ignoring the shock wave rippling across Zimbabwe. But inside the newsroom, a frenzied revolution was taking place. Reporters who had for years bit their tongues while writing flattering stories saw an opening.

“It was a seismic shift for us,” Share said.

Days later, when thousands poured onto the streets of Harare to demand Mugabe’s resignation, the tenor of the paper’s coverage began to change. It started publishing straightforward news reports about the country’s swelling opposition. It sent reporters and photographers into crowds carrying anti-Mugabe signs. For the first time in decades, it gave Mugabe’s rivals a voice.

It wasn’t just the Herald that seemed to be liberalizing. Arbitrary police checkpoints vanished overnight. Foreign journalists, once heavily obstructed, could move freely (including into the Herald’s newsroom). The demonstrations themselves were unimaginable only weeks ago.

In the following days, the paper wrote front-page stories about Mugabe’s dismissal as head of the ruling party, ZANU-PF. It covered plans by the parliament to impeach the president. It ran op-eds in support of efforts to bring Mugabe down.

“We have no doubt that the biggest winner in this fiasco are the people of Zimbabwe,” said one.

Zimbabweans started posting pictures of the Herald on Twitter and Facebook, in disbelief that the newspaper of Mugabe had suddenly abandoned him. The paper had to increase its print run to keep up with demand.

“This in the Herald. Pinch yourself — it is not April Fools Day,” tweeted David Coltart, a former senator and member of the opposition, after the paper covered Mugabe’s dismissal from the party.

It wasn’t just that the Herald was eager to seize a rare moment of press freedom. Its senior editors were also trying to sort out who was likely to emerge from the country’s political chaos — so they knew which horse to back.

“You don’t want to step on the wrong toes,” said Phyllis Kochere, the deputy news editor.

On Tuesday, the paper sent its parliamentary reporter, Farirai Machivenyika, to cover a session in which lawmakers were expected to begin protracted impeachment proceedings. But about an hour into the session, Machivenyika watched as the speaker of the house stood up with a piece of paper in his hand, a smile spreading across his face.

The speaker began to read a resignation letter written by Mugabe. Machivenyika took frantic notes. Like many of the Herald’s reporters, he was born after Mugabe assumed power in 1980. He could hardly believe he was about to file a story about the president’s resignation.

He thought to himself: “This is what relief feels like.”

The next day, the Herald ran the words “Ta Ta, Cde President” on the front page, with the full text of Mugabe’s resignation letter. In an editorial, the paper wrote: “Last night was a new beginning for Zimbabwe.”

In the morning, the newspaper’s staff gathered for the news meeting, its first of the post-Mugabe era.

Nyathi looked around at the other editors and reporters and muttered under his breath, “Well, what do I do now?”

For about an hour the staff debated what had just happened to their country and what was going to come next.

“There’s a need for a coalition government,” said Ruth Butaumocho, the gender editor.

“If ZANU-PF thinks it will lead the country alone, they will continue just like Mugabe,” said one editor.

“We need to come up with an objective analysis of the trajectory the country’s politics is going to take,” another said.

“Things are changing every hour,” Kochere said.

“We need more stories!” yelled Nyathi.

That day, the major story line was the return of the soon-to-be president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who had been in exile for several weeks since being fired as vice president. No one — not even the paper’s reporters — was sure how the Herald would cover it.

Would Mnangagwa get the same kind of flattering coverage that Mugabe had received for so many years? Would the Herald continue its streak of more objective reporting?

That night, Mnangagwa’s speech veered into the anti-opposition rhetoric that Mugabe had often used.

“Those who oppose us will bark and bark,” he said. “They will continue to bark, but the ZANU-PF train will roll on, ruling and ruling while they bark.”

It was exactly the kind of language that many of the Herald’s top reporters and editors had expressed concern about, a sign that Mnangagwa had no interest in forming a broad coalition. But the paper didn’t cover that angle. Instead, it published positive news stories and editorials, including one on the front page under the headline “President needs our maximum support.”

Had the paper’s brief window of freedom closed? Back in the newsroom, opinions were divided.

“Like any other media business, we are expected to toe the owner’s line,” said Kochere.

Share was more optimistic.

“There are no sacred cows now,” he said.

In the front entrance of the Herald, the portrait of Mugabe had already been taken down, leaving a slightly discolored rectangle on the wall where it once hung. The newsroom looked like any other — with piles of yellowing paper atop desks, clusters of reporters discussing their stories, editors trying to plan the day’s coverage.

Kochere looked through a list of story pitches in the center of the room. Outside, a crowd was waiting for Mnangagwa to arrive at the president’s office, waiting to see what he would say on the eve of his inauguration.

Kochere sighed. She had been at the paper for 17 years. She knew the Herald as well as she knew Zimbabwean politics.

“I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed,” she said. “It’s a divided nation.”

(AP)

Egypt’s security forces were on high alert Saturday after striking back at militants whose massacre of more than 300 people at a Sinai mosque raised fears of a new and bloodier phase in the country’s struggle against Islamist insurgents.

Egypt’s state-run Information Service tried to portray Friday’s carnage — at least 305 dead, or about quarter of the male population of the village of Rawda — as a sign of “weakness, despair and collapse” among militants opting for easy civilian targets rather than hitting heavily armed security forces as in the past.

But the level of coordination and precision by the attackers gave no obvious suggestions of a struggling force in an area where Islamic State-inspired groups have gained a key foothold.

The assault on a mosque — a rarity in Egypt — also raised concerns over increasing threats to the country’s minorities, including the Muslim Sufi community hit Friday.

Survivors and officials described five pickup trucks carrying up to 30 gunmen — some of them masked — converging on the al-Rawda mosque as the imam began his sermon. Some worshipers died in a suicide blast; others were gunned down as they ran. The attackers would later walk among the fallen, 27 of them children, shooting those who appeared to be breathing.





[Why extremists stuck this mosque in Egypt]

Eyewitnesses said that some had carried a black flag that local residents recognized as belonging to the State of Sinai, a local Islamic State affiliate that has remained largely intact even as the Islamic State’s strongholds in Iraq and Syria have crumbled.

By the time the attackers left, there were so many bodies on the ground that a fleet of ambulances couldn’t hold them, said a local resident, Muhamed Khalil, 25. Instead, the bodies were piled high on the back of pickup trucks and in the trunks of private cars.

Although no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, suspicion immediately fell on Islamic State-linked militants who have dueled with the army across the desert region.

President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi vowed to avenge the bloodshed with “brute force” — pushed by widespread horror to act with even more resolve. But the contours of a tougher approach remain hazy.

Egyptian security forces have been locked in battle with the country’s Islamic State affiliate for several years. The insurgency has killed hundreds in the heavily patrolled Sinai region, and militants have struck farther afield, including Coptic Christian churches in Cairo and Alexandria.

“The Egyptian government has been describing its reaction to every attack as a harsh response since the summer of 2013, if not before. So it’s difficult to assess what is meant by a promise to do more than that,” said Zack Gold, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.

Late Friday, the army said that it launched airstrikes on vehicles apparently used by the assailants, but it was unclear if any suspected militants were killed in the counterattack.

In Rawda, a hamlet off the road that cuts across northern Sinai, almost no one was untouched by the violence.

[Trump tries to use Egypt attack to boost calls for border wall]

According to Egypt’s 2011 census, Rawda was home to some 2,100 people. Assuming the population had stayed relatively constant, it appeared that Friday’s massacre would have killed about a quarter of the male population.

“We had to bury them in mass graves. In every hole, we would bury 40 or 50,” said Khalil, who help lay entire families together. “People were silent, motionless, unable to grasp the reality of what had happened.”

The massacre also drew acts of kindness. Community members arrived in droves at a hospital to donate blood, first aid kits and all the painkillers they could afford.

Egyptian security forces have been locked in battle with the militants since 2011, when the group — then known then as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis — initially trained its firepower on Israel. But when the army overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013, the militant group shifted its sights toward Egypt’s security forces, its attacks growing more deadly as state repression of Sinai’s Bedouin inhabitants worsened.

Since the militants’ 2014 pledge of allegience to the Islamic State, the government has worked to keep its war with extremists in the shadows. Journalists are banned from entering the area, amid frequent reports of militant atrocities and heavy-handed tactics by the army.

But local residents said that an attack had been threatened for weeks.

“An ISIS member would stand at the entrance of the village, hand a piece of paper to a resident and ask him to deliver it to one of the Sufi scholars in the area,” said a local journalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fears for his safety.

“The attack was never a surprise to the community here. It is the savagery that was,” he said.

Experts on militancy in the Sinai Peninsula have attributed the group’s growing brutality to a rising number of members who do not have family ties to North Sinai, as well as the pressures that accompany affiliation with the Islamic State.

“When you call yourself ISIS, you have to start copying the more brutal attacks and showing you’re in control,” Gold said.



The dead were believed to be mostly Sufi Muslims, a branch of Islam considered heretical by many extremists. Some also may have had links to a local tribe that had opposed the Islamic State’s presence in the area. An edition of the Islamic State’s al-Nabaa newsletter, published last year, featured an interview with one of the group’s Egyptian cadres, who promised to “combat the manifestations of polytheism including Sufism.”

Friday’s attack made those dangers manifest on a national stage. Keeping his eyes glued to a state television broadcast Saturday, Mohamed Saleh, a pharmacist in Cairo, described the attack as a “lightning shock.”

“They targeted Muslims. They killed Muslims,” he said. “Egypt has suffered a lot, but these are our cruelest years.”

British tabloids are saying another royal engagement is right around the corner, but will Prince Harry really ask his American girlfriend to marry him? (The Washington Post)

Merry olde England has had a glum run of news. The divorce from the European Union is going badly — a lot of fuss about alimony. There’s been a “sex pest” scandal in Parliament. And the British pound is getting pounded.

So, as if on cue, the flash story this week was the feverish speculation about exactly when — never if — Prince Harry and the American actress Meghan Markle would finally announce their engagement to wed.

The only thing better than royal babies are royal weddings — but one must precede the other. Of course, the most momentous royal news of all is also on the horizon, another life event, this one sad yet inevitable. Queen Elizabeth II turned 91 years old in April, God save her.

On Friday, the tabloids went a little nuts. The Sun ran a salivating headline claiming that a Harry and Markle engagement announcement was “imminent.”

The Daily Mail was more specific. They had a date and time. On Friday, it tweeted, “Prince Harry and Meghan Markle rumoured to be announcing their engagement at 5pm TODAY.”

Caption The British royal has been in camera viewfinders since his birth.

Pool/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.

Today came and went. No matter.

If you’ve missed your latest copy of Hello magazine, Markle is a 36-year-old actress, born and raised in California, best known for playing Rachel Zane in the well-liked New York legal drama “Suits,” which is filmed in Toronto.

It’s rumored that she will quit her acting career and will continue her charitable work. She is a global ambassador for World Vision Canada.

The 33-year-old ginger-bearded Harry is fifth in line to the British throne. (He will be bumped to sixth place after his brother Prince William and Kate Middleton welcome their third child in the spring.) With modern medical science being what is — and the Tower of London now a tourist attraction versus a gallows — Harry’s chances of sitting on the big chair are virtually nil.

Still, Harry is one of the most popular royals, said to have inherited his mother Princess Diana’s mischievous side, as well as her common touch. He also has had his share of past missteps, including stirring major royal flaps in 2005 by wearing an outfit with a swastika to a costume party and in 2012 with photos showing him playing “strip billiards” in a Las Vegas hotel suite.

The last time an American married into the royal family, Britain was plunged into a constitutional crisis. In 1936, King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry the American socialite and divorcée Wallis Simpson.

There are no hard and fast rules for royal engagements, but perhaps William and Kate can offer us clues as to how it might be done this time.

William and Kate were engaged after a lengthy courtship. The tabloids called her “Waity Katie.”

Palace officials announced their engagement at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday — on Nov. 16, 2010, to be exact. Kate pronounced William “a true romantic” and said he popped the question on an African safari to view wildlife. The couple held a “photocall” event with the world’s media and then gave a sit-down interview to a broadcaster, which was aired later in the day. They were married five months later.

Rumors of an engagement between Harry and Markle have been swirling for some time.

In November 2016, Prince Harry revealed he was dating the actress when — in a remarkable statement from Kensington Palace — he blasted the press for subjecting Markle to a “wave of abuse and harassment.”

The palace condemned “the smear on the front page of a national newspaper, the racial undertones of comment pieces, and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.”

Markle’s mother is African American, and her father is white.

Her relationship with Harry has been a source of intense media speculation ever since the statement. And along the way, royal watchers wondered if the couple wasn’t dropping clues that there was a wedding in the offing.

In April, Markle ended her lifestyle blog, The Tig, after three years.

“Something to tell us?” queried the Daily Mail.

The same newspaper reported that the couple had tea with the queen last month, sparking rumors that they were seeking her majesty’s blessing.

Apparently the meeting went well — a good thing, too. Under ancient rules, the monarch has the right to refuse a royal marriage.

The duo made their first public appearance together in September at the Invictus Games, a sporting event for disabled veterans founded by Harry. They held hands, they kissed, they canoodled — they were snapped alongside Markle’s mother, Doria Ragland.

Markle has been living in Toronto, where “Suits” is filmed. However, there are rumors she has left the show and is planning on relocating to London, where she could move into Harry’s two-bedroom cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace.

“Has Harry pupped the question?” ran the front-page headline in the Sun, Britain’s best-selling newspaper, making a very tabloid-esque pun after stories appeared that Markle was moving her dogs to London. The paper said that “BBC staff had been primed” to expect an announcement.

“What DO they know?” asked the Daily Mail on its front page, noting that a British bookmaker stopped accepting bets on Harry popping the question this year.

Markle has spoken about their relationship in prescient and hopeful terms.

“We’re in love,” she told Vanity Fair magazine. “I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.”

The results say a lot about our political divisions.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/11/22/at-yale-we-conducted-an-experiment-to-turn-conservatives-into-liberals-the-results-say-a-lot-about-our-political-divisions/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2017/11/iStock-545582186-e1511367272206.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"When my daughter was growing up, she often wanted to rush off to do fun things with her friends — get into the water at the beach, ride off on her bike — without taking the proper safety precautions first. I’d have to stop her in her tracks to first put on the sunscreen, or her bike helmet and knee pads, with her standing there impatiently. “Safety first, fun second,” was my mantra.

Keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from harm is perhaps our strongest human motivation, deeply embedded in our very DNA. It is so deep and important that it influences much of what we think and do, maybe more than we might expect. For example, over a decade now of research in political psychology consistently shows that how physically threatened or fearful a person feels is a key factor — although clearly not the only one — in whether he or she holds conservative or liberal attitudes.

[A political scientist has discovered a surprising way to increase voter turnout. It starts in childhood.]

Conservatives, it turns out, react more strongly to physical threat than liberals do. In fact, their greater concern with physical safety seems to be determined early in life: In one University of California study, the more fear a 4-year-old showed in a laboratory situation, the more conservative his or her political attitudes were found to be 20 years later. Brain imaging studies have even shown that the fear center of the brain, the amygdala, is actually larger in conservatives than in liberals. And many other laboratory studies have found that when adult liberals experienced physical threat, their political and social attitudes became more conservative (temporarily, of course). But no one had ever turned conservatives into liberals.

Until we did.

In a new study to appear in a forthcoming issue of the European Journal of Social Psychology, my colleagues Jaime Napier, Julie Huang and Andy Vonasch and I asked 300 U.S. residents in an online survey their opinions on several contemporary issues such as gay rights, abortion, feminism and immigration, as well as social change in general. The group was two-thirds female, about three-quarters white, with an average age of 35. Thirty-percent of the participants self-identified as Republican, and the rest as Democrat.

But before they answered the survey questions, we had them engage in an intense imagination exercise. They were asked to close their eyes and richly imagine being visited by a genie who granted them a superpower. For half of our participants, this superpower was to be able to fly, under one’s own power. For the other half, it was to be completely physically safe, invulnerable to any harm.

If they had just imagined being able to fly, their responses to the social attitude survey showed the usual clear difference between Republicans and Democrats — the former endorsed more conservative positions on social issues and were also more resistant to social change in general.

[Stanford researchers: The secret to overcoming the opioid crisis may lie partly in the mind]

But if they had instead just imagined being completely physically safe, the Republicans became significantly more liberal — their positions on social attitudes were much more like the Democratic respondents. And on the issue of social change in general, the Republicans’ attitudes were now indistinguishable from the Democrats. Imagining being completely safe from physical harm had done what no experiment had done before — it had turned conservatives into liberals.

In both instances, we had manipulated a deeper underlying reason for political attitudes, the strength of the basic motivation of safety and survival. The boiling water of our social and political attitudes, it seems, can be turned up or down by changing how physically safe we feel.

This is why it makes sense that liberal politicians intuitively portray danger as manageable — recall FDR’s famous Great Depression era reassurance of “nothing to fear but fear itself,” echoed decades later in Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address — and why President Trump and other Republican politicians are instead likely to emphasize the dangers of terrorism and immigration, relying on fear as a motivator to gain votes.

In fact, anti-immigration attitudes are also linked directly to the underlying basic drive for physical safety. For centuries, arch-conservative leaders have often referred to scapegoated minority groups as “germs” or “bacteria” that seek to invade and destroy their country from within. President Trump is an acknowledged germaphobe, and he has a penchant for describing people — not only immigrants but political opponents and former Miss Universe contestants — as “disgusting.”

“Immigrants are like viruses” is a powerful metaphor, because in comparing immigrants entering a country to germs entering a human body, it speaks directly to our powerful innate motivation to avoid contamination and disease. Until very recently in human history, not only did we not have antibiotics, we did not even know how infections occurred or diseases transmitted, and cuts and open wounds were quite dangerous. (In the American Civil War, for example, 60 out of every 1,000 soldiers died not by bullets or bayonets, but by infections.)

Therefore, we reasoned, making people feel safer about a dangerous flu virus should serve to calm their fears about immigrants — and making them feel more threatened by the flu virus should cause them to be more against immigration than they were before. In a 2011 study, my colleagues and I showed just that. First, we reminded our nationwide sample of liberals and conservatives about the threat of the flu virus (during the H1N1 epidemic), and then measured their attitudes toward immigration. Afterward we simply asked them if they’d already gotten their flu shot or not. It turned out that those who had not gotten a flu shot (feeling threatened) expressed more negative attitudes toward immigration, while those who had received the vaccination (feeling safe) had more positive attitudes about immigration.

In another study, using hand sanitizer after being warned about the flu virus had the same effect on immigration attitudes as had being vaccinated. A simple squirt of Purell after we had raised the threat of the flu had changed their minds. It made them feel safe from the dangerous virus, and this made them feel socially safe from immigrants as well.

Our study findings may have a silver lining. Here’s how:

All of us believe that our social and political attitudes are based on good reasons and reflect our important values. But we also need to recognize how much they can be influenced subconsciously by our most basic, powerful motivations for safety and survival. Politicians on both sides of the aisle know this already and attempt to manipulate our votes and party allegiances by appealing to these potent feelings of fear and of safety.

Instead of allowing our strings to be pulled so easily by others, we can become more conscious of what drives us and work harder to base our opinions on factual knowledge about the issues, including information from outside our media echo chambers. Yes, our views can harden given the right environment, but our work shows that they are actually easier to change than we might think.

The Hermit Kingdom has been accused of stealing the cryptocurrency, hoarding it, and even mining it.

Now, students at a Pyongyang university, once accused of training the state’s hackers, have been given a crash course in cryptocurrencies — something that’s never happened before.

It’s the first hard evidence of North Korea’s growing interest in cryptocurrencies and bitcoin, in particular. While the course could be a normal opportunity given the current appeal of bitcoin, some experts suggest it’s evidence of a more sinister fascination, related to hacking, theft, and even the avoidance of sanctions.

“There should be no mistaking this course as a benevolent academic exchange; everything in North Korea is carefully evaluated and managed by the regime,” Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at security intelligence firm Recorded Future, told VICE News.","priscilla moriuchi

In 2008, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized for Canada’s horrific history of residential schools, offering a $2 billion dollar compensation package, but survivors of five schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were left out because the province hadn’t officially joined Canada until 1949. Those survivors brought a lawsuit against the Canadian government, demanding an apology and compensation. The government spent nearly a decade fighting them in court before finally agreeing last year to $50 million in compensation.

On Friday, Trudeau apologized, allowing his government to tick off one of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 recommendations — to settle with plaintiffs not included in the 2008 scheme.","happy valley goose bay

The attack took place in the volatile Sinai Peninsula, and the death toll has been revised upwards several times already and is likely to increase again. At least 109 people were wounded in the attack.

The militants attacked the al-Rawdah mosque in the town of Bir al-Abd, 125 miles northeast of the capital, Cairo. No organization has claimed responsibility for the attack, but several news outlets noted that Egypt’s government has struggled to contain an Islamic State insurgency in the area. Attacks on mosques are rare in Egypt, as militants have preferred to attack Coptic Christian churches and security officials.

Four off-road vehicles pulled up outside the mosque before detonating bombs inside the mosque, and opening fire on worshippers who were listening to the sermon, according to police officers who spoke to the AP. The militants had also cut off escape routes by blowing up vehicles and leaving the burning wrecks blocking the roads around the mosque.

The worshippers at the mosque were followers of Sufism, or Islamic mysticism, a branch of Islam which is seen as heretical by IS.

The attackers did not rush away from the scene, even as emergency services arrived, opening fire on several ambulances, Ahmed el-Ansari, a senior government health official, told state television.

The sparsely populated Sinai Peninsula has previously been described as a “nesting ground for terrorism and terrorists” by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi following a suicide bombing that left 31 soldiers killed in 2014.

The Islamist insurgency in the region has increased since the military overthrew the democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013.","abdelfattah elsissi

Ashley Renders,"Instagram accounts under 50,000 followers can earn up to $2,000 per post",2017-11-24T15:44:01+00:00,vice-news,This is how people earn thousands of dollars from social media,https://news.vice.com/story/what-does-it-take-to-make-a-living-on-social-media,https://news2-images.vice.com//uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-24-at-10.39.18-AM.png,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Laurie Shannon had no experience with filming, social media, or cake decorating when she started making YouTube videos from her parents’ basement.

She taped parchment paper over a lamp and used a camera she already owned to make her first videos, which she uploaded to her channel, The Icing Artist. “It was really hard because the quality of the content wasn’t good,” says Laurie. “We uploaded every week, but didn’t get any momentum.”

For the first two years, The Icing Artist earned about $5,000 per year. She kept her costs low by using gear she already owned, but she made a big investment in time. She worked at a bakery to pay the bills and spent every evening and weekend baking, filming and editing. “I thought if I keep pushing and pushing then maybe I can get there.”

Over time, the Icing Artist attracted 1 million subscribers, giving Laurie the opportunity to work from her home near Toronto alongside her fiance who also quit his job to work on the channel full time. Together, they earn between $10,000 and $40,000 per month.

Making cake videos from your home might sound like a dream job, but it’s no get-rich-quick scheme. “It was two and a half years of hard work before I could do this full time, and it’s still hard work,” says Laurie. “We work seven days a week and long hours every day.”

As more people try to become influencers, they are coming face-to-face with this harsh reality, says Robert Kyncl, Chief Business Officer at YouTube, in his new book.

YouTube alone saw 1,000 accounts “cross the 1,000-subscriber threshold every day in 2016,” says Kyncl’s book. “Breaking through the noise to capture a viewer’s precious attention has never been harder, even if the opportunity exists for nearly anyone to do so.”

Successful influencers like Laurie have built their careers on real relationships with their fans and developing quality content that speaks global audiences—showing that influence can’t be manufactured, it has to be earned.

Influence is money

Paying social media stars to promote products is becoming a popular way for brands to advertise online.



A decade ago, print advertising accounted for 53 percent of Google searches worldwide, according to Google Trends, which shows how often search terms are entered. Today, influencer marketing accounts for 51 percent of Google searches, while video advertising accounts for 32 percent and print advertising makes up the remaining 21 percent.

The millions of people who follow fitness, fashion, and pet accounts fit specific demographics. And their attention is worth a lot of money. This year, companies were expected to spend $50,000-$100,000 per influencer marketing program according to a survey by marketing agency Linqia.

Fitness influencer Lyzabeth Lopez, the creator of the Hourglass Workout, told Forbes she charges up to $5,000 per post and $100,000 per campaign. Famous yogi Rachel Brathen, who has more Instagram followers than the populations of most Canadian cities, charges a minimum of $25,000 per social media post, according to Forbes.

Even so-called “micro-influencers” can earn money from social media, says a recent blog post by the Influence Agency, a company that matches influencers with brands. Instagram accounts under 50,000 followers can earn between $250-$2,000 per post, while accounts with up to 100,000 followers can earn $1,000-$4,000 per post.

Max Chafkin, a writer at Bloomberg Businessweek, wanted to see just how hard it was to become an influencer, so he set out to turn his “schlubby” Instagram feed with 212 followers into a sleek men’s fashion account. His goal was “to persuade someone, somewhere, to pay me cash money for my influence.”

Chafkin dished out about $2,000 over six weeks on professional photography. He got a haircut, borrowed clothes from Lord & Taylor and enlisted the help of an agency pro bono. He also paid $10 per month for bots that left thousands of comments and likes around Instagram, and eventually resorted to buying 500 fake followers for $15.

Chafkin ultimately completed his goal, but he doesn’t have an optimistic outlook on the industry. “I spent a couple thousand dollars and got one free t-shirt,” Chafkin told VICE Money. “I was so far away from breaking even it’s almost not even worth talking about.”

The experiment shows that it is possible to use tricks to jumpstart an influencer career, says Chafkin. “But in the end you’re going to need some sort of talent.”

The size of a creator’s audience is the basis for how much they get paid, but brands consider lots of other factors when they decide whether to work with an influencer, according to Parker.

Having high-quality content that looks authentic and fits a creative niche can get the attention of a brand. It’s also important that your followers are real people who engage genuinely with your content, he explained.

Being reliable and responsive is another big part of working with brands because they have strict deadlines, according to Parker. The creators who turn their brands into businesses are ultimately the ones that will thrive in the industry, he explained.

Jahtna Hernandez did all of the above last year when she switched up her approach to YouTube and turned it into a source of full-time income.

Last year, she was unemployed, in debt, fresh out of a relationship, and living with her parents. She decided to focus on her YouTube channel, xoJahtna, and spent the next three months immersed in creating videos. “I would go days without sleeping…my mom was very concerned,” says Hernandez.

She had failed at YouTube two years before — she was creating nail art videos and had built up a following of 70,000 subscribers. But she didn’t enjoy filming it and eventually quit.

Hernandez decided to change the topic of her channel and make videos about do-it-yourself life hacks. Her first video demonstrated different ways to style your hair using household items like a fork. Something about the video resonated with her online audience. It went viral and her subscriptions started to snowball, giving her 77,000 followers and 2 million views in a single month. Her first cheque from YouTube paid off her entire debt, which had climbed to $8,000.

Hernandez was seeing success on YouTube, but it didn’t make her an influencer overnight. Her income was coming directly from YouTube ads, which is based on the number of views her videos had, rather than from brand deals.

It took another seven months and 320,000 subscribers for a brand to contact her about sponsorship. “You have to have a good amount of traction to actually live off of [YouTube],” she says.

Hernandez is learning how to negotiate with brands to increase her revenue and create a more sustainable career. The added pressure of delivering branded content has increased the intensity of her work, sometimes creating multiple videos at the same time to meet her deadlines.

To be successful at YouTube, “you have to go all the way in,” says Hernandez. “The harder you go, the more results you’ll get.”","linqia fitness influencer lyzabeth lopez

Henry McMaster.",2017-11-24T14:50:38+00:00,vice-news,Death penalty process will become secret if South Carolina’s governor gets his way,https://news.vice.com/story/death-penalty-process-will-become-secret-if-south-carolinas-governor-gets-his-way,https://news2-images.vice.com//uploads/2017/11/AP_17324762854555-1024x796.jpg,general,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"If South Carolina doesn’t pass a law to keep the drugs it uses for lethal injections a secret, the state won’t be able to carry out its first execution in six years on Dec. 1. Or at least that’s what South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster spent the week telling state lawmakers.

“Here we are at a dead stop and we can’t do anything about it unless and until our legislature enacts the shield law,” McMaster said at an emergency press conference with the Department of Corrections Director Bryan Stirling on Monday.

There’s just one problem: The scheduled execution of Bobby Stone, 52, on Dec. 1 was never going to happen because a federal court hasn’t reviewed his case yet. McMaster and Sterling created a false sense of urgency to publically call for a law that would make much of the death penalty procedure in South Carolina a secret. Stone’s execution was stayed — as expected — on Tuesday.

“From where I sit, this looks like political opportunism and an attempt to take advantage of the public’s lack of knowledge about how this works,” said Cornell Law School’s Director of Death Penalty Litigation Kier Weyble, who represents several South Carolina death row inmates. “If the legislature had acted today and passed a secrecy bill and the governor picked up the phone to his favorite compounding pharmacy, Stone’s execution was still not going to happen. There was always going to be a stay entered because of where he is in the road of state and federal review.”

READ: Some of the most important details of Arkansas’ execution spree will remain unknown

Bobby Stone was convicted of killing a police officer in 1997. He has exhausted his state court appeals, so the state set his Dec. 1 execution date last week. But he’s still entitled to the federal review process, so a federal judge stayed his case on Nov. 21, as everyone involved, including the state, expected.

“Bryan Stirling, knew a stay would be issued by the court,” Lindsey Vann, Executive Director of Justice 360, a nonprofit law firm representing Stone, said in a statement. “[Stirling] nevertheless chose to make public statements implying otherwise in an attempt to force the General Assembly to pass a ‘secrecy’ bill that would allow the state to purchase unsafe drugs for execution and shield their source from the public.”

Robert Kittle, a spokesman for the state attorney general’s office, confirmed to VICE News that the stay was “expected.”

South Carolina — along with many other states that still enforce the death penalty — hasn’t been able to secure the lethal injection drugs necessary to carry out executions, largely because of the stigma surrounding how they’re used. In an attempt to free up pharmacists and drug manufacturers to sell drugs to the state without fear of retribution, fifteen states have passed shield laws similar to the one that McMaster and Stirling are pushing for to keep the names of people involved in the process a secret. Secrecy laws also make information like the execution team’s training, the origin of the drugs being used, and the lethal injection procedure private.

South Carolina lawmakers did not pass two proposed death penalty secrecy bills in 2015 and 2016.

READ: The first execution under Virginia’s new drug secrecy laws didn’t go as planned

At the press conference on Monday, McMaster and Stirling said that without the shield law, they would not be able to follow through with Stone’s execution.

“The execution date has now been set by the courts for Dec. 1, but we’re unable to do it because we don’t have the drugs that are called for in the law to do a lethal injection,” McMaster said.

“We’ve got a week and a half to come up with the drugs, and right now, we do not have the drugs,” Stirling said. “We’re unable to get the drugs, and we’re in an interesting place right now. If the general assembly will pass the law we believe strongly like other states, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas …. We will be able to carry out this execution, but right now we are unable to.”

By concealing details about the execution process, secrecy laws also make it more difficult for death row inmates to challenge their sentences in court. Weyble, the Cornell professor, called the process an “unfair fight.”

“It’s more difficult to mount a challenge to the method of execution when you can’t find out exactly what kind of method is being used,” he said. “They have to go to the underworld for the tools of their trade because legitimate providers aren’t willing to do business with them. That should bother a person of conscience.”

Gov. McMaster and Director Stirling did not respond to requests for comment.

The 31-year-old former sprinter was not in the Bloemfontein court to hear a unanimous decision handed down by five judges on the Supreme Court of Appeal.

The ruling said High Court Judge Thokozile Masipa had “given [Pistorius’] rehabilitation undue weight” in her 2016 verdict, and there was no reason why the minimum 15-year sentence should not be imposed.

“The sentence of six years is shockingly lenient to the point where it has the effect of trivializing this serious offense,” the court said.

Rights groups claimed Pistorius had received preferential treatment because he is white and wealthy.

Pistorius’ sentence was commuted to 13 years and five months to reflect time already served.

Beijing toddlers “fed pills and given injections” at kindergarten

Three kindergarten teachers in Beijing were suspended this week after several parents claimed their children had been injected with unknown substances.

Parents have been protesting outside the kindergarten in Beijing’s upscale Chaoyang district since claims emerged that the toddlers of at least eight parents had been molested, fed pills and given injections.

Authorities in the Chinese capital have launched a wave of security checks on local kindergartens in response.

“My child is only three-and-a-half years, and I found needle marks on his thighs and buttocks. I am trembling with anger now,” one parent said, according to the state-run Global Times.

Parents have been demanding access to surveillance footage that could confirm the abuse after children claimed they had been given pills to make them sleep, and others reported being physically examined in a dark room.

Photographs of the alleged needle marks on the childrens’ bodies have circulated online, sparking widespread outrage on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

The case is the third recent abuse scandal to hit China’s early childhood education industry, creating panic among middle-class parents who send their children to private kindergartens.

Earlier this month, there were claims that staff at a day-care in Shanghai had beaten children in their care and force fed them wasabi.

The kindergarten at the center of the latest allegations is run by RYB Education, which claims to be China’s largest early childhood provider, with more than 1,100 nurseries and pre-school centers around the country.

The company said in a statement it was “deeply sorry” for the situation, and was waiting on the findings of the police investigations.

“We are cooperating with the police by providing relevant surveillance material and equipment. The teachers involved have been suspended,” said the statement.

North Korea is not taking their soldier’s defection well

North Korea has replaced all its border guards and is planting trees and digging trenches around the DMZ to deter future defections to South Korea.

Authorities in Pyongyang replaced between 35 and 40 border patrol guards after one of their members succeeded in an audacious escape bid on Nov. 13, despite being shot five times.

A South Korean intelligence official quoted by the Yonhap news agency said the soldiers may have faced disciplinary action.

“Signs were detected that North Korea has replaced all border security officials following the defection,” the source said. “Given this situation, commanders of the responsible military unit and senior officers might have undergone punishment.”

Acting U.S. ambassador to South Korea Marc Knapper paid a visit this week to the Joint Security Area — the part of the Demilitarized Zone where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face.

He posted a picture on Twitter showing soldiers on the North Korean side digging deep trenches and planting trees.

Dramatic video footage of the escape was released this week, showing the unnamed defector fleeing in a military jeep, and then on foot.

The defector has now regained consciousness. Three South Korean and two U.S. soldiers were awarded the Army Commendation medal for dragging the him to safety.

After 37 years, Zimbabwe has a new president

Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in as Zimbabwe’s new president Friday, becoming only the second person to lead the country in nearly four decades.

The 75-year-old took the oath of office in front of tens of thousands of cheering supporters at a packed stadium in the capital, Harare. Greeting the crowd with a raised fist, Mnangagwa pledged to “be faithful to Zimbabwe.”

The ceremony marks a stunning reversal of fortune for Mnangagwa, who earlier this month was sacked as the country’s vice president and fled to South Africa, fearing for his safety. His dismissal triggered the political turmoil that prompted the army to intervene and force Robert Mugabe to quit.

Mugabe was not at the ceremony to witness his former confidant formally usurp him, but officials from the ruling ZANU-PF party have said he will remain in Zimbabwe, immune from prosecution.

READ MORE: Mugabe’s successor has landed an impossible job

Returning to Zimbabwe Wednesday, Mnangagwa promised the dawn of “a new and unfolding democracy” for a country that had become economically ruined and internationally isolated by decades of authoritarian misrule.

He has promised to uphold democracy, and reach out to other countries for help in rebuilding Zimbabwe.

But strong links to the former regime mean questions remain over whether the swearing in of the man known as “The Crocodile” signals a true break with the past.

Mnangagwa, who was Zimbabwe’s spy chief during a bloody civil conflict in the 1980s, is associated with some of the worst atrocities of the Mugabe era, including massacres in 1983 when an estimated 20,000 people were killed in a political crackdown.

Mnangagwa has denied any involvement in the killings.

Putin tells Russian industry to “be ready” for war

Vladimir Putin alerted Russian industry to be prepared to switch production to military needs Wednesday, warning all “large-scale enterprise” should be ready for conflict.

Speaking at a conference of military leaders and arms dealers in Sochi, the Russian president outlined how all industries should be ready to do their bit for the Motherland.

“The ability of our economy to increase military production and services at a given time is one of the most important aspects of military security,” Putin said. “To this end, all strategic, and simply large-scale enterprise should be ready, regardless of ownership.”

Putin told the audience he had flagged this issue as far back as 2015, issuing instructions “to modernize production facilities, build up reserves of material and technical resources, and ensure the transportation of troops.”

This followed a Tuesday speech in which Putin said Russian military needed to have “the very best equipment — better than foreign equivalents.”

“If we want to win, we have to be better.”

Increased investment by the Kremlin has elevated Russia to the world’s third largest military spender with a total budget of almost $70 billion in 2016, it emerged earlier this year.

However, Moscow’s spending still lags far behind to China ($215 billion) and the U.S. ($611 billion).

Holocaust memorial built next to “anti-Semitic” politician’s house

Far-right German politician Björn Höcke woke up Wednesday to a new view out of his window — a Holocaust memorial.

Eleven months after he called Berlin’s tribute to Nazi victims a “monument of shame,” activists rented land adjacent to his home in the Thuringian village of Bornhagen and erected a miniature version of the memorial.

A Berlin artists’ initiative called the Center for Political Beauty raised more than €40,000 in a crowd-funding campaign to pay for construction and rent on the property.

The memorial consists of 24 concrete slabs, which the cooperative wants to keep it in place for at least five years.

Berlin’s “Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe” features almost 3,000 commemorative blocks covering five acres.

“Because Höcke is a ‘secret admirer’ of the monument, we’re going to build it right outside the house,” the artists said in a video released Wednesday.

The group said they will remove the installation if Höcke falls to his knees and begs forgiveness for Germany’s actions during World War II.

Höcke, a politician with the populist Alternative for Germany party, was seen Wednesday morning inspecting the construction through a pair of binoculars.

This is how quickly you run to escape North Korea

Dramatic video of a North Korean defector fleeing across the Demilitarized Zone while being fired upon by his fellow border guards was released Tuesday by the United Nations Command.

The closed circuit TV footage shows the unnamed soldier racing towards the border village of Panmunjom in a military jeep, pursued by his compatriots.

After the vehicle crashes, the defector runs to freedom, flanked by soldiers unloading their weapons.

He was shot five times before collapsing near the southern border of the DMZ where three members of South Korea’s security forces crawl out and drag him to safety.

The escape took place just after 3 p.m. on Nov. 13.

The defector is in a South Korean hospital, but doctors said last week he is struggling to recover due to the “enormous number” of parasites in his intestines.

Lead surgeon, Lee Cook-jong he had “only seen something like this in a textbook,” and revealed that the longest worm removed was 11 inches long.

The soldier has now regained consciousness and has asked to watch television, South Korean news agency Yonhap reports.

He is being shown South Korean films for his “psychological comfort,” the official said.

Lebanon’s PM rethinks quitting after getting the hell out of Saudi

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Saad Hariri reversed his shock resignation Wednesday after returning from Saudi Arabia, where the Lebanese government said he was coerced into quitting.

The PM unexpectedly announced he was standing down in a televised appearance from Riyadh earlier this month, sparking claims from his own government that he was being held hostage, part of the increasing regional tensions between the Kingdom and Iran.

Hariri said Wednesday he had presented his resignation to President Michel Aoun, but had been asked to “put it on hold ahead of further consultations.”

“He urged me to wait before offering it and to hold onto it for more dialogue about its reasons and political background, and I showed responsiveness,” Hariri said. Aoun had previously refused to accept the resignation unless it was made in person.

Hariri, who left Saudi Arabia following the intervention of Lebanon’s former colonial power France, has denied that Riyadh forced his resignation, during which he accused Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah of destabilizing his country.

There are fears the episode could spark conflict in Lebanon, a fragile multi-confessional democracy, by fueling tensions between the Saudi-backed political faction and Hezbollah, the most powerful force in the country.

Assad sneaked into Russia to thank Putin for “saving” Syria

Syria’s embattled president Bashar al-Assad has dared to leave his country only twice since it descended into a civil war six years ago. Both times, he’s gone to Russia to meet his strongest ally: Vladimir Putin.

On Monday, Assad slipped secretly into the Russian city of Sochi to thank Putin and a room full of Russian generals for “saving our country” after Russia intervened heavily against Assad’s enemies, some of which were backed by the United States. Assad’s previous trip to Russia, in October 2015, came right after Russia launched operations on his behalf.

Now, Putin appears to be maneuvering to become the key arbiter of Syria’s political future. Putin told Assad he planned to call Donald Trump later to discuss their conversation, before holding talks on Syria’s future with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran.

Unnamed Kremlin sources told Russia’s RBC news outlet that Russia plans to wrap up major operations in Syria by December this year, leaving behind only a small contingent for base maintenance.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently said Assad has “no role” to play in post-conflict Syria. But on Tuesday, a Kremlin spokesperson told reporters Assad’s future “can only be seen by the Syrian people.”

Turkey just banned pretty much all LGBT events in its capital

Last week Turkey’s capital city, Ankara, banned a German gay film festival, saying it could incite terror attacks. This week, local authorities decided to go ahead and just ban anything similar from ever happening again.

In a statement wide open to interpretation, the governor’s office announced it won’t allow any “film screenings” or “theater plays” related to homosexuality, or any such “panels, talks [or] exhibitions.”

The governor’s office said the ban is necessary to keep from stirring up the “hatred and hostility” of local residents, and the associated “danger that may arise in terms of public security.”

But rights groups said the move is akin to “criminalizing LGBTI existence” in the city.

“In an omnibus ban with a very wide scope, we are facing a situation that is vague, and open to interpretation and rights violations,” two Ankara-based LGBTI-rights groups, Pink Life and Kaos GL, said in a joint statement following the announcement by Ankara.

Homosexuality has been legal in Turkey since 1923, but rights groups say homophobia and discrimination are rampant amid a growing backlash by authorities in cities like Ankara and Istanbul. In 2015, for example, police drove off participants in Istanbul’s annual gay pride parade with tear gas and rubber bullets. Since then, the event “has been unjustifiably and unlawfully suppressed,” according to Amnesty International.

Germany’s embassy had helped organize the gay film festival that was banned last week, and the move seems likely to worsen the already strained relationship between Turkey and the European Union.

The Council of Europe’s independent Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muiznieks, issued a statement immediately slapping Ankara for the prohibition.

“The authorities’ duty is to protect these persons from the extremists and potential criminals threatening them, not restrict their rights,” he said in a statement on Twitter.

The move represents “growing intolerance towards LGBTI persons by the Turkish authorities,” he continued.

Turkey has faced widespread criticism in recent months over human rights abuses, including the arrest of tens of thousands in the wake of a failed coup attempt in 2016. Human rights advocates like local director of Amnesty International, Idil Eser, were among those swept up in the purge. Eser was recently freed after four months in jail but is still facing trial.

U.S. bans alcohol for 54,000 troops based in Japan

Takeshi Onaga in their meeting at the prefectural government office in Naha on Nov. 20, 2017.

All 54,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan were ordered to stay away from alcohol for an indefinite period starting Monday after a 21-year-old Marine crashed his 2-ton military truck into another vehicle, killing the driver. The Marine had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit, according to local police.

The governor of Okinawa was furious.

“It’s the same thing over and over again every time. I’m speechless,” Takeshi Onaga, Okinawa’s governor, told reporters.

In this instance, a 61-year-old man named Hidemasa Taira died in the hospital after being hit by Nicholas James-McLean at around 5:25 a.m. Witnesses said James-McLean cruised through a red light while the Japanese driver was turning right. He sustained minor injuries.

A similar 30-day ban was placed on American troops in Japan in 2016 after what local press called a “crime spree” by U.S. military personnel, including a drunken sailor striking two cars while driving the wrong way down a busy highway, and another soldier charged with raping and killing a 19-year-old Japanese woman, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase in the woods.

American military personnel have been making headlines recently for drunken antics, crimes, and misbehavior. Most recently the Navy apologized after one of its pilots used his jet to sky-write a gigantic penis in the skies over Washington state.

Germany skids into crisis after coalition talks collapse

Germans face an unwelcome return to the polls for another national election after coalition talks collapsed Sunday, leaving the European powerhouse in political limbo.

After four weeks of negotiations, the free-market liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) exited talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, and the Greens.

FDP leader Christian Lindner said there was “no basis of trust” among the parties, who had “no shared vision” of the country’s direction following September’s vote.

“It is better not to rule than to rule badly,” he said.

The parties reportedly failed to find agreement on issues including tax, the environment, and asylum policies. One sticking point was whether the families of Syrian refugees should be allowed to join them in Germany.

“I will do everything to ensure that this country comes out well through this difficult time,” Merkel said Monday.

Detailed time-lapse microscopy reveals how they sense and explore their surroundings, communicate with their neighbors and adaptively reshape themselves.",2017-11-25T12:00:00Z,wired,Seeing the Beautiful Intelligence of Microbes,https://www.wired.com/story/seeing-the-beautiful-intelligence-of-microbes/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a0a014de9686d21749a59e9/191:100/pass/Physarum-polycephalumk_Lede-2880x1220.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Intelligence is not a quality to attribute lightly to microbes. There is no reason to think that bacteria, slime molds and similar single-cell forms of life have awareness, understanding or other capacities implicit in real intellect. But particularly when these cells commune in great numbers, their startling collective talents for solving problems and controlling their environment emerge. Those behaviors may be genetically encoded into these cells by billions of years of evolution, but in that sense the cells are not so different from robots programmed to respond in sophisticated ways to their environment. If we can speak of artificial intelligence for the latter, perhaps it’s not too outrageous to refer to the underappreciated cellular intelligence of the former.

Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.

Under the microscope, the incredible exercise of the cells’ collective intelligence reveals itself with spectacular beauty. Since 1983, Roberto Kolter, a professor of microbiology and immunobiology at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Microbial Sciences Initiative, has led a laboratory that has studied these phenomena. In more recent years, it has also developed techniques for visualizing them. In the photographic essay book Life at the Edge of Sight: A Photographic Exploration of the Microbial World (Harvard University Press), released in September, Kolter and his co-author, Scott Chimileski, a research fellow and imaging specialist in his lab, offer an appreciation of microorganisms that is both scientific and artistic, and that gives a glimpse of the cellular wonders that are literally underfoot. Imagery from the lab is also on display in the exhibition World in a Drop at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. That display will close in early January but will be followed by a broader exhibition, Microbial Life, scheduled to open in February.

High magnification of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum shows the cytoplasm pumping furiously through its huge single cell. Scott Chimileski/Roberto Kolter This cytoplasmic streaming allows the slime mold to push forward toward nutrients and potentially carpet a surface. Scott Chimileski/Roberto Kolter

The slime mold Physarum polycephalum sometimes barely qualifies as a microorganism at all: When it oozes across the leaf litter of a forest floor during the active, amoeboid stage of its life cycle, it can look like a puddle of yellowish goo between an inch and a meter across. Yet despite its size, Physarum is a huge single cell, with tens of thousands of nuclei floating in an uninterrupted mass of cytoplasm. In this form, Physarum is a superbly efficient hunter. When sensors on its cell membrane detect good sources of nutrients, contractile networks of proteins (closely related to the ones found in human muscle) start pumping streams of cytoplasm in that direction, advancing the slime mold toward what it needs.

But Physarum is not just reflexively surging toward food. As it moves in one direction, signals transmitted throughout the cell discourage it from pushing counterproductively along less promising routes. Moreover, slime molds have evolved a system for essentially mapping their terrain and memorizing where not to go: As they move, they leave a translucent chemical trail behind that tells them which areas are not worth revisiting.

After Physarum explores an area and finds it lacking in nutrients, it leaves behind a chemical trail as a kind of externalized memory that tells the slime mold not to go back there. Scott Chimileski/Roberto Kolter

When bacteria were first observed through a microscope, suspended in liquid on slides, in their simplicity they seemed like the archetypes of primitive, solitary cells. The truth, however, is that in the wild, most bacteria are highly gregarious. Some bacteria do swim through their environment as lonely individuals but most bacterial cells—and most species of bacteria—prefer to live in compact societies called biofilms anchored to surfaces. (The individual swimmers often represent offshoots of biofilms, seeking to colonize new locations.)

In a high-magnification scanning electron micrograph of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm, the individual rod-shaped bacteria are interlinked by hairlike structures called pili. Scott Chimileski/Roberto Kolter Bacillus bacteria secrete an extracellular matrix that encases the cells and helps them form a more structured community. Steve Minsky

Moreover, biofilms are not just dense accumulations of bacterial cells. They have elaborate functional structures, inside and out, that serve the cells’ collective destiny, as can be seen in the images below of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The biofilm is stained with Congo red dye, which bonds to the extracellular matrix proteins that the bacteria secrete as a scaffolding for their community. The deeply wrinkled surface of the biofilm maximizes the area through which the bacteria can absorb oxygen; it also probably helps them collect nutrients and release waste products efficiently.

As this Pseudomonas biofilm expands, it develops a more complex internal structure. Bacteria in different parts of its mass may also develop more specialized functions. Scott Chimileski/Roberto Kolter

Within the biofilm, the bacteria divide the labor of maintaining the colony and differentiate into forms specialized for their function. In this biofilm of the common soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, for example, some cells secrete extracellular matrix and anchor in place, while some stay motile; cells at the edges of the biofilm may divide for growth, while others in the middle release spores for surviving tough conditions and colonizing new locations.

The wrinkled structure of this Bacillus subtilis biofilm helps to ensure that all the bacteria in it have access to oxygen (left). A digital scanned model of the biofilm helps illustrate how the bacterial community can vary its structure in three dimensions (right). Scott Chimileski and Roberto Kolter

One might wonder why natural selection would have favored this collective behavior instead of more rampant individualism among the cells. Part of the answer might be what evolutionary theorists call inclusive fitness: In so far as the bacteria within a biofilm are related, individual sacrifices are offset by the increases in fitness to each cell’s millions of cousins. But it may also be that every role within the biofilm has its advantages: Cells at the edge are most exposed to dangers and must reproduce furiously to expand the biofilm, but they also have access to the most nutrients and oxygen. Cells on the inside depend on others for their vital rations but they may survive longer.

The surfaces that biofilms grow across are not always solid. These B. subtilis are forming a pellicle—a kind of floating biofilm at the interface between water and air. The genetic pathways involved in forming a pellicle are essentially the same as those used in growing across stones, though they may respond to the changes in their habitat by altering the precise mix of proteins in the extracellular matrix as needed.

Bacteria can grow across nonsolid surfaces, too, as this B. subtilis culture shows by forming a pellicle, or floating biofilm, across the air-liquid interface in a beaker. Scott Chimileski/Roberto Kolter

Expansive growth is not the only way in which microbial communities can move. Below, B. subtilis is engaging in a behavior called dendritic swarming, in which cells rapidly push outward in branching columns that can efficiently pave a surface. Biofilms swarm when they detect that they are in environments rich in nutrients: Swarming helps a biofilm exploit this valuable territory before any competing communities can.

At least two important changes in the differentiation of the cells in a biofilm take place to enable swarming. First, motile cells on the periphery of the film develop extra flagellae, which enables them to swim more energetically. Second, some edge cells also begin to secrete surfactant, a slippery material that helps the motile cells slide more rapidly over the surface.

When biofilms grow in flat laboratory dishes, the dendritic columns of swarming biofilms remain neatly distinct: They extend and coil in and around one another but they do not cross. That seems to be in part because the surfactant piles up around the biofilm branches as a barrier. Similarly, some bacteria can swarm in more terraced structures under laboratory conditions. What the implications of that option are for bacteria in nature is still a mystery.

These bacteria are engaging in the behavior called dendritic swarming, which allows a microbial community to expand rapidly into desirable, resource-rich environments. Scott Chimileski/Roberto Kolter

Another type of behavior demonstrated by biofilms growing under laboratory conditions is spiral migration, demonstrated in the time-lapse video below of Bacillus mycoides. These bacterial cells grow in long chains or filaments that curl either clockwise or counterclockwise. The specific advantages of this spiraling movement are still under investigation, according to Chimileski, but they must be considerable because B. mycoides excels at taking over available environments. “Bacillus mycoides is one of the easiest bacterial species to cultivate from the soil,” he explained. When scientists isolate microbes from soil and grow them on agar dishes, particularly at room temperature, “the mycoides will often spread across the entire plate and overtake all of the other organisms. For this reason, it is considered if anything a kind of ‘nuisance species’ for many microbiologists.”

What’s curious is that the direction of the spiraling migration—clockwise or counterclockwise—seems to be a hereditary trait: Different strains of bacteria, even within the same species, spiral in different directions. It is yet another example of how bacteria, obeying instructions in their individual DNA, can manifest problem-solving behaviors that are surprisingly complex and adaptive at the collective level of biofilms. These geometric and presumably functional patterns that biofilms produce in culture are intriguingly beautiful. Yet Chimileski notes that there is much left to discover when it comes to translating behaviors seen in the lab to natural microbial communities.

Chimileski points out that “most natural biofilms are multi-species ecosystems and cells inside natural biofilms usually grow more slowly.” He continued, “I like to think of the way we grow bacteria in a petri plate, where a single species is by itself and has everything it needs to grow at optimal temperatures, as ‘turning up the volume’ on the biology of the organism.” Under laboratory conditions, researchers can study which genes are involved in complex multicellular behaviors and they can measure the benefits to the fitness of the bacterial species. But in natural environments, biofilms don’t usually get to form exactly the same patterns as in the lab because of limited nutrients or competition with other species. “So the same biology might be occurring on a particle of soil in your backyard at smaller size scales and over longer time periods,” he said, even if it is less easy to visualize.

Spiral migration is a behavior favored by the highly successful soil bacterium Bacillus mycoides. Communities of these cells expand by forming long filaments of cells that coil either clockwise or counterclockwise—an orientation that is strain-specific and genetically determined.

Biofilm behaviors testify to the capacity and openness of bacterial to form collectives—but that openness has limits, as shown in this culture with several cohabiting biofilms. Here, adjacent biofilms that consist of the same bacteria or closely related strains comfortably merge. But the adjacent biofilms made up of more divergent bacteria keep themselves distinct and may even try to eliminate or control each other.

Biofilms are so intolerant of other strains and species because they invest considerably in the production of surfactant, extracellular matrix and other molecules that bacteriologists classify as public goods—ones that the bacteria secrete for other members of their community. The bacteria guard these jealously because unrelated freeloading cells could benefit strongly by using them first.

Biofilms rebuff such freeloaders in different ways. For example, the B. subtilis colonies in this image adopt a strategy of “kin discrimination,” in which they secrete antibiotic compounds that are toxic to other species but not to their own. Proteus mirabilis bacteria defend their interests in a different way based on “self-recognition”: The P. mirabilis biofilms examine encroaching cells, stab any from a different species with a spearlike structure and inject them with poisons that will kill almost all but closely related species.

Several different strains of B. subtilis grow side by side in this dish. Because the biofilms discriminate against dissimilar strains of bacteria, they may merge compatibly with close relatives but form boundaries against others. Scott Chimileski

The colors appearing in the biofilm culture of Streptomyces coelicolor in the video below reflect natural pigments that the bacteria produce. The value of the pigments for the biofilms is not entirely clear, but it is probably not tied to their color. Rather, these pigment molecules are often bioactive in various ways. “The blue pigment seen in this video is actinorhodin, which is technically an antibiotic,” Chimileski said, but added that the term is misleading in this context. “Killing or growth inhibition usually occurs only at very high concentrations relative to what is out in nature.” For that reason, he said, there is “an emerging view that killing is probably not the ecological function of many or most antibiotics. Rather, these bioactive molecules act as signals or developmental cues” to other cells.

That view is echoed in a note from Gleb Pishchany, another research fellow in Kolter’s laboratory who studies how diverse types of bacteria cohabit. “An intriguing possibility is that in natural ecosystems, Streptomyces use pigments and other bioactive molecules” at “lower concentrations as signals that are exchanged among multispecies microbial communities,” he wrote. The pigments may help cohabiting assortments of bacteria rein in one another’s less neighborly instincts, and thereby maintain a more cooperative and fruitful communal existence.

In this powdery colony of Streptomyces coelicolor, the pigmentation comes from actinorhodin, a molecule with antibacterial effects. Biofilms may use bioactive pigments as signals for controlling the behaviors of other microorganisms in their shared environment.

These striking photographs of microbe communities were captured by DSLR cameras. Chimileski collects his still images with macro lenses while working at the bench, while the videos are made in an incubator dedicated to time-lapse microscopy. He sets the camera to snap a picture every 10 minutes, although he increases the frequency to every minute or two for behaviors happening more quickly, such as the movements of slime molds. As a result, the movements of the microbes in these videos are typically accelerated between 5,000 and 50,000 times their actual speeds. Chimileski does not use false color to beautify the images: Aside from using dyes to stain the extracellular matrix in some cultures, he shows the natural coloration of the microorganisms.

Chimileski typically grows bacterial colonies at 30°C, a temperature at which he can collect images of slower growing species for several weeks. Although the heat and humidity suited to biofilm growth are less than ideal for cameras, he said the equipment is rated for more extreme conditions. The few cameras that have malfunctioned did so for a mechanical reason: The number of shots that he needs to document microbial behaviors is so large that the shutters on the cameras eventually break down after hundreds of thousands of clicks.

Aarian Marshall,"In the ultra-crowded city, caverns could offer room for things like waste management and treatment, data storage, parking, and slaughterhouses.",2017-11-25T12:00:00Z,wired,Hong Kong Is Turning Caverns Into Real Estate,https://www.wired.com/story/hong-kong-caverns-real-estate/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a15ea51e2135f7de872efe3/191:100/pass/hongkongcaverns-FA.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Hong Kong, to put it simply, is running out of room. More than 7 million people live in the 427 square mile autonomous region of the People’s Republic of China. Country parks take up 41 percent of the land mass, all of which is dotted by steep hills, making it difficult to build anywhere. Many high rises have maxed out on height restrictions. Meanwhile, housing prices hit record highs this spring: Hong Kongers are paying nearly $1,500 per square foot. The average home costs $1.8 million.

The government’s looking into rezoning and building in rural areas, but it’s also in search of a long-term strategy to create more real estate. What to do? Well, according to the geotechnical engineers in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’s Civil Engineering and Development Department, the answer is down. Like, under the ground, in newly built caverns.

“All the urban flat land in Hong Kong is already a built-up area,” says Tony Ho, the department’s geoengineering head. Since the early 1980s, the Hong Kong government has explored the idea of building caverns, straight into hilly areas too, well, hilly to develop. In 2011, the government completed a comprehensive feasibly study, pinpointing 48 prospective caverns for long-term development, ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.8 square miles. Six more studies to push the project along are already underway.

This month, the project walked away from the annual International Tunneling Association’s awards banquet—in gay Paris!—with the award for Innovative Underground Space Concept of the Year. (It beat out an Israeli plan to use tunnels to create an underground cemetery and a Turkish transportation megaproject.)

No, the plan is not to make people live like bats in these cool, dark spaces. Instead, the newly created real estate could host sewage and water treatment plants, data centers, reservoirs, and storage facilities. The government is considering other (lower priority) options, too: archives, oil, gas, or wine storage, bicycle and car parking, laboratories, and sports facilities. The caverns could hold mausoleums, mortuaries, incinerators, crematoriums, and, to round out the death theme, slaughterhouses.

“What we are thinking is, if we can best use the underground space resources, we can turn the constraint into an opportunity,” says Ho.

Using tunnels to create extra space is far from a new idea. The city’s engineers cite inspirations in Norway (the underground Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall, built in 1975 but updated in 1995, can host 5,500 people in its pool and ice hockey facility); Singapore (it finished its Underground Ammunition Facility in 2008); and good ol’ Kansas, USA (entrepreneurs there transformed a limestone quarry into an underground industrial park used for cloud computing storage, packaging manufacture, and sorting mail.) Hong Kong itself already has some rock cavern facilities, including a 424,000 cubic foot salt water reservoir for Hong Kong University, a sewage treatment works completed in 1995, and an explosives depot. A waste transfer facility refurbished in 2013 marks the city's biggest rock cavern project to date.

But the work going on now is grander in scale. It's a scheme to totally reorganize public space in the region. “When we try to relocate facilities underground, that allows an opportunity to replan a whole area,” says Edward Lo, chief town planner with the Hong Kong Planning Department. Moving functions like parking and data storage under the earth means that land can be used for housing or businesses, and hopefully ease prices.

Big plans don’t come cheap. The Hong Kong government estimates rock cavern excavation alone can range from $190 to $250 per cubic foot; total cost of construction might be $320 to $450 per cubic foot. One very small, 12-car parking garage could cost $7.3 million to construct.

The good news is that all that payment comes up front. “The thing about tunnels, which is their greatest advantage: The total lifecycle cost of these structures is really favorable for people who are thinking long-term,” says Thom Neff, a civil engineer who has built tunnels throughout his career and now runs the consulting company OckhamKonsult. “Once you build this structure in rock, there’s nothing to do. It’s just there, forever. Whereas any other structure you build, you have to maintain it.”

If Hong Kong is willing to shell out all the money—and it’s already earmarked hundreds of millions for the project—it should get some good, hardy infrastructure for its buck. The timeline, though, is still very hazy. One sewage and treatment facility has made it through the design phase, with construction set to begin in 2018 or early 2019. The other prospective cavern projects are still being studied. If they’re approved, they’ll go through detailed designs and then construction. That's likely a decade-long process, says Mark Wallace of the engineering firm Arup, which is working with Hong Kong on the project.

So, a word of advice to Hong Kongers dreaming of being interred in the depths of a rock cavern: hold on a few more years. And if you're a cow, stay away from the cave.

Adam Rogers,What I learned cruising the seas with a ship full of nerds celebrating geek culture while inverting classic rules of social hierarchy.,2014-12-19T06:30:55Z,wired,What 800 Nerds on a Cruise Ship Taught Me About Life,https://www.wired.com/2014/12/nerd-cruise/,https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ff_nerdcruise15_g-FEATURE-ART-1000x630.jpg,technology,2017-11-25 17:43:22.601739,"Adam Savage, host of the tv show MythBusters, has a workshop in San Francisco’s Mission District. The walls and shelves—pretty much every surface, actually—are covered in movie and TV costumes and props, some actually used in filming and some replicas Savage acquired or made. Every time I go there I turn into Rain Man, compelled to silently identify and catalog everything I see, names and metadata popping up in front of my eyes like in the Terminator’s head-up display. Gun from Blade Runner. Glove from Hellboy. Go bag from The Bourne Identity. Time travel watch from Voyagers!

At a party at the workshop one evening I find myself talking to a Noted Writer, familiar from magazines and radio, a star of a kind. She is sitting on the edge of Savage’s brown-felted pool table. I introduce her to Paul Sabourin, half the comedy musical duo Paul and Storm, and explain that I’m about to write a story about the fan cruise he helps organize, the JoCo Cruise Crazy, named after its cofounder and headline performer, singer-songwriter Jonathan Coulton.

After chatting with us for a few minutes, Sabourin moves on, and I’m left alone with the Noted Writer. “Do you know what all this stuff is?” she asks, motioning at the display cases with her drink. “I have no idea what any of it is.”

“It’s kind of my thing,” I say. “You know, theref’s a lot of overlap between liking this kind of stuff and the JoCo Cruise.”

“Right,” the Noted Writer says, frowning. “Nerds.” She puts her drink down on the pool table.

It has been years since I have heard anyone say that word, nerds, with contempt. It’s been a compliment for, what, a decade now?

“I’m really sorry about this,” I say, reaching to move her glass. It’s wet; it’ll hurt the felt. And even though it’s not my party and not my workshop, I’m suddenly feeling very defensive.

Jonathan Coulton loves cruise ships. He loves the weird artificial mall running down the middle, and he loves staring off the back of the ship into infinity. That’s not to say that David Foster Wallace’s famously dark assessment of shipboard vacationing (“There is something about a mass-market Luxury Cruise that’s unbearably sad”) is unfamiliar. The lanyard that holds a laser-cut wooden JoCo Cruise name tag around my neck came printed with the phrase “A supposedly fun thing I’ll never do again.” Inside jokes are the coin of the realm around here.

We’re sitting in the courtyard of a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hotel; our ship departs tomorrow morning. Around us, other cruise-bound performers are gathering—Grant Imahara of MythBusters is introducing himself to NPR host Peter Sagal. The comedian Paul F. Tompkins is filling a plate with nachos at the buffet. This trip, Coulton says, he might break his rule not to go Jet Skiing, but he’s not sure what he’ll do with his glasses.

Coulton has built a career out of self-released albums and podcasts. Gentle and bearded, he’s the “one-man house band” on an NPR quiz show and was the “contributing troubadour” for the magazine Popular Science. Coulton used to be a software engineer, a nerd in a cubicle, but he dreamed of being a musician—and unlike most people with those kinds of dreams, he made it happen. Perhaps more impressive, he did it without a record label, through persistence and online savvy, including a year in which he podcasted a new song every week. That heroic origin story resonates with white-collar nerds who feel their spark of creativity getting dimmer while they screw around in IT or at a lab bench.

When Coulton was at Yale and a member of the Whiffenpoofs, the a cappella group had a gig on a cruise. They befriended a blackjack dealer and cadged an invitation to a crew-only party, a whole secret world belowdecks. Coulton says the party was a sweaty, dancy good time. So maybe it makes sense that for the past four years he has run his own alternate world on a cruise ship. “We think of it more like a convention than a music cruise,” Coulton says. “Actually, I’ve never been on a music cruise. I should probably go on one.”

Fan cruises are big business, of course, but for Coulton it’s certainly not about the money. He’d probably make more touring. “I just think of it as a thing that is really fun and feels really great,” he says. “And it has continued to get more and more special as we evolve these traditions.”

Allow me to push up my glasses and explain what the people on this cruise have in common: The performers are apex nerds, primary exponents of nerd culture. Owing to his past as a coder, his heavy presence online, and the fact that his songs often involve supervillains and zombies, Coulton has an epic following among the geekily inclined. The other performers on the cruise—led by Paul and Storm, and including, among others, the musical duo Pomplamoose, musicians Sara and Sean Watkins, the creators of the Thrilling Adventure Hour podcast, and Lego artist Nathan Sawaya—are highly relevant to those interests.

And the passengers? This convention at sea has grown increasingly elaborate. For this year, the fourth, 800 Sea Monkeys (as they call themselves) are boarding the Independence of the Seas not just for nightly musical and comedy performances. They are coming for the 24-hour game room run by Wil Wheaton (famed blogger, gaming expert, cast member on Star Trek: The Next Generation), hot tub “office hours” with author and The Daily Show correspondent John Hodgman, and a semiformal dance where fezzes and tiaras are de rigueur. They’ll commune with their fellows at their own shadow festival of karaoke, off-the-books parties, and events that they’ve coordinated for months on social media and, while at sea, on fan-built apps that use the ship’s Wi-Fi. “It’s a very tribal thing that happens. They certainly self-identify as nerds and/or geeks. I prefer to think of them as ‘enthusiasts,’” Coulton says. “I’m not being modest when I say that for many people this event is less about me and more about the community.”

Indeed, as we board it’s clear that the Sea Monkeys unite around much more than Coulton’s music. They share a love of cosplay, gaming (computer and tabletop), and science fiction. A disproportionate number are scientists and engineers. When the onboard PA calls out for every passenger to muster for the mandatory lifeboat drill, one of the Sea Monkeys in my group imitates the whistle from the intercom on the original Star Trek series. Everyone in the crowd laughs in recognition. On the cruise, everything that once signified outcast status becomes the triumphant plumage of a culture in ascendance.

So: A ship of nerds, of which I am one. A secret font of geek culture. A pop-up community that inverts the classic rules of social hierarchy and celebrates new ones. Which should sound pretty great to me. It really should.

This is a partial list of T-shirts that I see on the JoCo Cruise Crazy: Batman logos Superman logos (slightly fewer) Supernatural (a long-running TV show about attractive young men who hunt demons) Welcome to Nightvale (a podcast about a fictional town with supernatural problems) Famous scientists rendered in line drawings (“There’s a key on the back,” its owner says.) Firefly (the short-lived space adventure TV show from Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon) A Tardis (the blue phone-booth-shaped mode of travel through time and space on Doctor Who) “Math Is Delicious” Grimlock (a Transformer robot who turns into a Tyrannosaurus rex and talks like the Hulk: “Me Grimlock!”) United Federation of Planets (Star Trek) “Bookwyrm” (with a picture of a dragon wearing reading glasses in a library)

Rubik’s Cubes in various states of disintegration (melting ones, colored squares as Post-its blowing away in the wind, etc.) “Back to the Tardis” (The Doctor from Doctor Who, but instead of his Tardis—see above—he’s standing in front of the time-traveling DeLorean from the Back to the Future movies) “Fake Geek Girl” (on a man) Minnie Mouse as a monster-god out of HP Lovecraft, with a green face full of tentacles “Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain” (Harry Potter. Everyone on this cruise was Ravenclaw.) “Old School” written in early-1980s-style LED letters next to a first-generation Atari joystick A Tyrannosaurus rex being lifted aloft by balloons Evil Spock (with the goatee) from the Star Trek episode “Mirror, Mirror,” rendered in the style of Shepard Fairey’s Obey print Velma from the cartoon Scooby-Doo, looking postapocalyptic and armed with a gun and a machete, alongside a ferocious-looking Great Dane version of Scooby and a Mad Max-style armored version of the Mystery Machine that’s decorated with subtle memorials to the rest of the apparently dead Scooby gang And finally: A Jawa from Star Wars armed with a katana, pulling on chains an armless C-3P0 and armless silver droid that otherwise looked just like C-3P0 (this is E-3P0, who appears briefly in The Empire Strikes Back) across the Tatooine desert, just like Michonne does with two armless zombies in the comic book The Walking Dead I bring up the T-shirts not just because they illustrate, literally, the common bonds that nerds like to assert—Hey, I like the things you like! Many of which are somewhat obscure!—but because of how utterly ordinary they are aboard the Independence of the Seas. For the weeklong JoCo Cruise, those T-shirts are not a declaration of otherness. They are a uniform. The esprit de dork doesn’t stop with the shirts. At a dance party early in the cruise, Hodgman and his friend David Rees—known for the online comic Get Your War On and the TV show Going Deep—share DJ duties. They spent weeks before the cruise perfecting their sets. As they work the Sea Monkeys into a pulsing frenzy (and as I drink more), a pattern emerges on the dance floor. Look past the loony variability—the couple doing the polka to “Ring of Fire,” the woman dancing with an illuminated Hula Hoop, the kilts and utility pouches—and you see the congruity: This is the most unabashed display of nerdness I’ve seen outside MIT. It is a skyscraper-sized boat full of people who were once sequestered and who are now calling the shots for modern popular culture. It feels like a victory party. Two days later, as Paul and Storm’s main-stage concert is reaching a crescendo, Sabourin asks for the house lights to come up. He looks out at the crowd. “This is like the analog Internet,” he says. “I think tech support in most of North America is down by 26 percent.” Big laugh. On the JoCo Cruise, Paul and Storm have just slightly lower billing than Coulton. And their big hit, the song everyone is waiting for, is “The Captain’s Wife’s Lament,” referred to colloquially as “The Pirate Song.” It’s a chantey, sung from the perspective of a woman whose husband returns from more than a year at sea and brings his entire crew to stay at their house. The punch line is that the next morning, the wife awakens to find seamen everywhere. (“There’s seamen here in front of me/And seamen in the rear/My God—there’s even seamen/Hanging from the chandelier.”) Because it’s the Big Hit, Paul and Storm like to wind the crowd up a bit, get them in a piratical mood. They ask the audience to give them a big “Arrrrr!” Like a pirate.

“Hit us two times!” Storm says. “Arrrrr! Arrrrr!” the audience shouts back in unison. “Hit us pi times!” Storm says. “Arrrrr! Arrrrr! Arrrrr! Ar!” goes the audience. Accuracy counts, right? Sabourin is satisfied. “All right,” he says to cheers. “Let’s fucking do this!” And they start playing the song. It is the kind of moment that should make you love nerds—the camaraderie, the reveling in the obscure, the punch-line-as-emergent-behavior. I should have been ready to hit Paul and Storm with e arrrrrs and maybe even i more. I roll pretty hard when it comes to nerd-dom (if rolling hard means having a custom set of gaming dice). I wore a Ghostbusters pin on my knockoff Members Only jacket for all of eighth grade. In college I worked in a lab where my job was to collect sea urchin semen for a study of intracellular motility. The only sport I have ever shown facility with is fencing. I once played Magic: The Gathering for 18 hours straight. I have a personal relationship with the Force, know what powers a Klingon starship, tried to convince my wife to name one of our kids after a character from Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, and one year at San Diego Comic-Con got drunk with the cast of Stargate SG-1. I cover science. For WIRED. There’s a reason Mr. Spock resonates—he was a genius, he didn’t understand emotion, and even if a girl liked him, he couldn’t really figure out what to do about it. By rights, the JoCo Cruise Crazy should be, for me, a comforting voyage into a world of geek triumphalism. But even as the dance party hangover ebbs, I can’t get comfortable with all this … overtness. I am already in the club, but somehow I can’t identify as a member. Three or four decades ago, being a nerd was isolating, lonely. Maybe you found some solace at comic conventions or via the Doctor Who fan club newsletter (my dad got me a subscription), but by and large, nerds mostly got made fun of for reading too much and ate lunch alone. Lacking the ability to form an empathic connection to other human beings didn’t help. There’s a reason Mr. Spock resonates—he was a genius, he didn’t understand emotion, and even if a girl liked him, he couldn’t really figure out what to do about it. (Poor Nurse Chapel, right?) In the wild, that kind of person stood out and was victimized for it—like everyone who doesn’t live at the top of the stochastic distribution. But then a weird thing happened. Somewhere let’s say in the mid- to late 1980s, the overculture started seeking out nerds, geeks, wonks, whatever you called them, because they could do stuff that was starting to seem important. They needed us. “A lot of the stigma is evaporating, not because of anything nerds have done themselves but because of a realization that the qualities of the nerds are useful for the world,” says John Scalzi, a New York Times best-selling science fiction writer and veteran of two JoCo Cruises. At the same time, the increasingly ubiquitous communications technologies that made geeks valuable also let them get in touch with each other. It turned out they—we—weren’t eating lunch alone. We were eating lunch together, just really far apart. Online bulletin boards, chat rooms, Multi-User Dungeons, the Usenet … suddenly we could talk to one another. Result: The overculture started the process of absorption and commodification. Nerds became an economic bloc to be marketed to. And with some strategic improvements in visual-effects technologies, other people—snorks, as they’re called here on ship—could come to appreciate the pop culture staples that had sustained us through the dark years. Now everyone is into geeky stuff. Now all the movies are superhero movies. That’s how The Avengers made more than $1 billion worldwide in 2012.

The JoCo Cruise celebrates that mainstreaming but also manages to feel special, small, and isolated from the real world. Safe. “It’s very hard living on the outside,” says Rachel Baker, whom I meet in the bar at the top of the ship. It’s called Olive or Twist, but because it has huge, outward-projecting windows, Sea Monkeys call it Ten Forward. Baker owns a bookstore in Alexandria, Virginia. She’s sociable, tattooed, nicely dressed. I’m not trying to be creepy—my point is that anywhere else Baker would not trigger even my fairly sensitive nerd-dar. I’d be wrong; she gets misty talking about being an outsider. The cruise, she says, “is so special. I’m really happy to meet more of my own people.” I am not. Where the Sea Monkeys see community, I see epistemic closure. All the shared references and common rhetorical tactics don’t feel supportive to me—they feel almost lazy, as if the triumph of the nerds means not having to meet the normals halfway. Down where the games are, a lower-deck cluster of three converted conference rooms, someone has posted a sign on the wall: SNORKS ARE PEOPLE TOO! (“We the undersigned pledge to be nice to snorks and to refrain from making snarky snork comments!”) Snorks are people too. The sign is supposed to remind everyone to treat them compassionately, to not insult them or look down upon them for being Other. In other words: Don’t be bullies. The performers’ chill-out room is a nice suite on deck 10 with a long balcony, a baby grand piano, a decently stocked bar with snacks, and a creepy skinless robot cat that meows and purrs. The performers hang there just about every night, well into the early morning. They talk about the performances they liked. And they plan future collaborations. Coulton’s wife, Christine Connor, produces David Rees’ TV show. Coulton wrote a theme song for Scalzi’s book Redshirts. Everyone seems to have been guests on one another’s podcasts, or plans to be. Scalzi calls it “a ferment,” but that doesn’t quite do the gathering justice. These are the nerd illuminati. The performers admit, though, to being a little astonished by the depth and reach of Sea Monkey culture. John Roderick, lead singer for the Long Winters, old friend of Coulton and Hodgman, and costar of a podcast with geek efficiency expert Merlin Mann, describes the common thread among fans on board as a culture thing, being “resolutely un-negative,” possibly to the point of a disconcerting social relativism. “The central dogmas are ‘do as thou wilt’ and ‘be excellent to one another,’” Roderick says. “It’s like Bill & Ted.” So why would something so cultlike grow up around Coulton? He’s charismatic, but he isn’t leading any kind of movement to overturn the jockocracy. “Jon is a futurist and a utopian,” Roderick says. “To him, ignorance is the enemy of enlightenment. If you just learn, your prejudice will go away.” “Oh God,” I say. “It’s Star Trek.” Roderick pats me on the back: “Next Generation.” Which, a couple of days later, leads me to Wil Wheaton. I find him on a couch in the performers’ suite, drinking 10-year-old Laphroaig. Since Star Trek, Wheaton has had a successful run as a writer and video host, along with gigs on The Big Bang Theory and other shows. His take: “We tend to be an inclusive, enthusiastic, welcoming group of people. If we can turn a Muggle into a gamer, then we have another person we can play games with.” “But there’s a certain audience-maintenance aspect, right?” I am figuring that a cruise like this is an alternative to, say, touring or promoting a product. “That’s a cynical, business way to look at it,” Wheaton says. “I wouldn’t come here if I didn’t enjoy it.” He says his agent hates that the cruise takes him away from Los Angeles in the middle of pilot-casting season. Wheaton comes anyway. But now I’m working through a checklist of possible explanations for the cruise’s culture. “So is it a victory lap for nerd-dom?” “I don’t think of it as a victory lap. I think of it as a celebration of our ability to find people who share the things we love,” Wheaton says. “We did have to live in the shadows because the so-called cool kids were cruel to us. A lot of us who grew up in that, we’re adults now, and it’s important to us to make a world where our kids don’t feel that.” That churns up a few shards from the archive, I have to admit. Getting made fun of for using big words, for reading too much, for wearing a Spock shirt to third grade, for— “One more thing,” Wheaton says. “Um?” “Get our culture right. I am inherently distrustful of all media. There are still journalists who would try to make it a freak show.” Wait. What? I don’t even trigger Wheaton’s presumably keen nerd sensors? I am rendered simultaneously relieved and lonely. Even though Wheaton hasn’t pinged me as a friendly, his words have an effect. He doesn’t dwell on it, but he was a Starfleet officer serving under the legendary Captain Jean-Luc Picard on the USS Enterprise. (On television.) (But still.) Also, Wheaton sports facial hair that has a kind of Commander Riker vibe. So for me this is a little like getting a peat-scented scolding from both the Enterprise‘s XO and Ensign Wesley Crusher at once. It is all I can do not to say, “Aye, sir.” When we get to Grand Cayman, I go on an excursion: snorkeling. I am a lousy swimmer, but I went snorkeling once in Belize, and after I got over the fear of drowning and the weird acrophobia you get from floating high above a seabed and the claustrophobia of confinement underwater, it was pretty fun. Not this time. I basically freak out as soon as I get into the water, listening to my own breath in the snorkel get more and more ragged and irregular, flailing around instead of floating. I can’t seem to move in any direction except dangerously close to the boat or dangerously far from it. Finally I give up. While I am sitting on the boat’s edge trying to convince myself to get back in—when the hell else am I going to be in Grand Cayman, snorkeling on WIRED’s dime?—one of the other people on the excursion comes over. She is tall and thin with cropped, multicolored hair (mostly blue) and a pierced lip. She introduces herself as Sara, but I already know who she is. This is Sara Chicazul, famous among Sea Monkeys for, among other things, having sold handmade custom fezzes to other Sea Monkeys to fund her cruise. This year she also made buttons that said “Hi,” so people who felt lonely would know that anybody wearing one was someone they were welcome to talk to. Chicazul is not her real name, of course. She does her textile work in a mostly blue vernacular, and having been on the Internet since she turned 14, she has systematically removed her true identity from all social media. In real life, Chicazul works in retail in Vancouver. When she came up to introduce herself on the snorkeling boat, I looked alone, out of place, and frightened. I looked like a fucking nerd on a boat. She walked over to make that OK. And even though I sort of realize what she is doing, and in my head am making noises like, “Oh, no, right, I see, but I’m totally fine, and I’m not part of this because in my bag there is a notebook and I’m really just here as a reporter, though on the other hand thank you,” what I in fact say is my name, and we chat about how she got started making fezzes. Looking back on it I have to think that Chicazul coming up to me, hair dye running down her forehead, shivering in the breeze, wearing the only articles of clothing she’d packed that she hadn’t made—bathing suit and a borrowed T-shirt—was just about the sweetest thing ever. “I was making a really aggressive goal this time of, if I don’t know someone, to walk over and introduce myself,” Chicazul later tells me. After we talk on the snorkeling boat I go back in the water. It’s fun.

Peter Sagal, host of the NPR game show Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me, is built like a quad ATV. He’s an avid runner—he leads jogs every morning around the track on the Independence‘s upper deck. The group eventually dubs itself “Wait, Wait, Don’t Lap Me.” Sagal’s big performance is a monologue, a reading accompanied by Sara Watkins playing a mournful pseudo-This American Life fiddle. It is a story of how he and his nerd friends used to try to “pass,” to not appear as nerds. “We studied sports,” he says. “We learned to laugh like a normal person, which is ‘ha, ha,’ not the nerd way, which is ‘that’s very amusing.’” Eventually, jocks raided his D&D game, but the nerds fought back—he calls it, to laughter, the Short Hills Riot—“the start of the nerd liberation movement.” The Sea Monkeys impress him, he says, because they are “proud. You’re out.” Stipulated: Push on Sagal’s analogy too hard and it’ll break. No country has ever made nerdery punishable by imprisonment or death. No one has ever said that their religious text prohibits nerdy behavior. It has always been legal for nerds to get married. But still, Sagal is onto something. Growing up, I wasn’t exactly proud and out myself. I tamped it down. In response to my own inability to function in polite society as a nerd, and in response to society’s inability to be polite to me, I tried to dress better. I learned to read cues to someone’s emotional state through observation and learned to manifest my own emotions in a believable way. I stopped quoting Ghostbusters all the time (mostly), and I tried to quit being such an arrogant jerk. Anybody at all close to me wouldn’t be fooled, but for purposes of casual consumption? I went into the closet.","isaac asimov’s foundation series
