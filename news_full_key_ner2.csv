""We’ve seen this in so many places of the world, that Mr. Trump has no appreciation for diplomacy,"" Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said to ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. ""I think the president is damaging our national security and standing in the world for his inability to use diplomacy in the right way.""

Trump on Tuesday recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and initiated the process of moving the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv.

Arab leaders in the Middle East and others, including Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron, spoke out against Trump's decision.

""There was a right way of doing this,"" Cardin said. ""It should have been done in a way to advance the peace process for a two-state solution. Instead the president just made the announcement and did not take advantage of that, in regards to the Israelis, and offered the Palestinians very little.""

""He did not really try to move forward on the peace process,"" the senator said.","senate foreign relations committee

The announcement came the same day that the Federal Emergency Management Agency said federal assistance in Puerto Rico has topped $1 billion.

The death toll increased after the government on Saturday attributed two additional deaths to the storm.

""These deaths that are certified today as indirect deaths related to Hurricane Maria are the result of investigations into cases that have been brought to our consideration,"" DPS secretary Hector M. Pesquera said in a statement.

The official death toll remains heavily scrutinized by critics, though, who believe the figure is significantly higher.

The New York Times on Friday published a review it conducted of daily mortality data from Puerto Rico’s vital statistics bureau. It discovered that 1,052 more people than usual died on the island following Hurricane Maria’s landfall. It's figures like this, in addition to reports that there was an increase in cremations and of bodies at morgues, which have many people questioning the official death toll.

One of the two deaths certified Saturday occurred in Orocovis, located in the interior Central Mountain Range, the DPS said.

""The person died the day of the hurricane and the body did not pass through the Department of Forensic Sciences (NCF), because a doctor in the death certificate certified as natural his death,"" according to the DPS statement. ""The deceased had multiple health conditions and relied on an oxygen machine. In the early hours of the day of the hurricane, the power went out in the residence and when the relatives went to see the person they found him dead.""

The statement continued, ""In a review of the case by the NCF and by the interview with the relatives, it was determined that the death is indirectly related to the hurricane.""

The other death was reported in Morovis, located in the island's central region. The individual died the day the hurricane hit the island, according to the DPS. A doctor initially certified the death as natural on the death certificate, but the NCF said it later evaluated the documentation to authorize the cremation requested by the family members.

""The person had health problems, but suffered complications during the day of the hurricane,"" reads the statement. ""Due to the inclement weather conditions, the ambulance took a long time to reach the residence. This death is added as indirectly related to the hurricane.""

Also on Saturday, FEMA said federal assistance to Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria has topped $1 billion.

FEMA said more than a million Puerto Rican residents registered for FEMA assistance. FEMA also said it has provided funds to more than 366,000 families in Puerto Rico including:

- More than $259 million in financial assistance for rental, repair or to rebuild residences

-More than $251 million for grants to repair or replace damaged personal property or to pay for disaster-related necessary expenses and other serious needs.

Ramon Espinosa/AP

Other FEMA assistance provided also includes:

-More than $39 million of low-interest disaster loans provided to more than 880 survivors and 50 business owners through the U.S. Small Business Administration

-More than $58,000 approved for Disaster Unemployment Assistance to 12,000 residents

-More than 19,000 Blue Roofs installed

-More than $1 million in flood insurance claims

In addition, more than $470 million has been obligated in FEMA Public Assistance grants to provide emergency generators for critical facilities, and to reimburse municipalities for debris removal and other necessary government expenses related to ""life-safety missions.""

Puerto Rico's electrical grid remains problematic: Its electrical grid generation took a hit Friday into Saturday, dropping nearly twenty percent to just 49 percent, according to the Puerto Rico Power Energy Authority (PREPA). That figure later increased to 56.6 percent. PREPA said Friday that the electrical grid was generating 68 percent of its capabilities.

PREPA spokesman Carlos Monroig told ABC News Saturday night that the generation number is “dynamic and changeable.” Monroig said the generation fluctuated based on time, weather, and the use of power by government, residential, commercial and industrial spaces.","puerto rico power energy authority prepa

ABC News,"Most Republicans leaders in Alabama say they plan to vote for Roy Moore on Tuesday, despite sexual misconduct allegations against the former judge that have prompted others around the country to say he should never be allowed to join the U.S. Senate. ""I have stated both publicly and...",2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,abc-news,Most Alabama Republicans say they are voting for Roy Moore,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/alabama-republicans-voting-roy-moore-51698664,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_39d604ad148140c1b78d01e70b861ff1_16x9_992.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Interested in Roy Moore?

In his sternest rebuke yet, Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said repeatedly Sunday his state can ""do better"" than electing fellow Republican Roy Moore to the U.S. Senate, making clear that a write-in candidate was far preferable to a man accused of sexual misconduct.

Days before the pivotal race, Shelby, who is Alabama's senior senator, said he had already cast an absentee ballot for another, unspecified Republican, even as other prominent state Republicans fell in line behind Moore.

Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in the special election Tuesday to replace Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general.

""I couldn't vote for Roy Moore. I didn't vote for Roy Moore. But I wrote in a distinguished Republican name. And I think a lot of people could do that,"" Shelby told CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""The state of Alabama deserves better,"" he said.

""There's a lot of smoke,"" Shelby said of Moore and his accusers. ""Got to be some fire somewhere.""

The accusations against Moore have left many GOP voters and leaders in a quandary. Voters face the decision of whether to vote for Moore, accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers decades ago when he was a county prosecutor, or sending Jones to Washington, which would narrow the GOP's already precarious majority in the Senate.

They also could write in a name on their ballots or simply stay home. Meanwhile, most GOP politicians in the state must run for re-election next year — where they will face Moore's enthusiastic voting base at the polls.

Shelby said allegations that Moore had molested a 14-year-girl in particular were a ""tipping point"" in disqualifying him. His latest comments cast fresh doubt on a former judge that President Donald Trump and most Republican leaders in Alabama are backing to help maintain the party's narrow 52-48 majority in the Senate.

Shelby's outspokenness against a man who could become his colleague was the exception rather than the rule.

""I have stated both publicly and privately over the last month that unless these allegations were proven to be true I would continue to plan to vote for the Republican nominee, Judge Roy Moore,"" Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill wrote in a text message to The Associated Press. ""I have already cast my absentee ballot and I voted for Judge Moore.""

The AP tried to find out how Republican leaders from Alabama plan to vote. Most officeholders or their staffs responded, while others have publicly stated their plans during public appearances or to other media outlets.

However, several officeholders did not respond to calls, emails or texts from the AP. They include U.S. Reps. Martha Roby, Mike Rogers and Gary Palmer, as well as state Treasurer Young Boozer and state House Speaker Mac McCutcheon.

State officeholders who said they intended to vote for Moore often cited the need to keep the seat in Republican hands.

In addition to Merrill, others who plan to vote for Moore include Gov. Kay Ivey; Attorney General Steve Marshall; state Auditor Jim Zeigler; Agriculture Commissioner John McMillan; state Senate President Pro Tempore Del Marsh; and Public Service Commissioner Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, who previously led the state GOP. Also voting for Moore are current state party head Terry Lathan and U.S. Reps. Mo Brooks of Huntsville and Robert Aderholt of Haleyville.

Shelby's decision has played prominently in Jones ads pointing out Republicans who are not voting for their party's nominee.

On Sunday, Shelby acknowledged that if Moore is elected, he would probably have to be seated in the Senate but that an Ethics Committee investigation was already been contemplated to remove him. ""I think that the Senate has to look at who is fit to serve in the Senate,"" he said.

CNN reported last month that U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne said he will vote Republican and that he does not cast write-in votes. In a statement to the AP, Byrne said it is up to voters to decide.

""Some serious allegations have been made and Judge Moore has vehemently denied them. Frankly, I don't think the people of Alabama want me, any national politician, or the national news media telling them what to think or how to vote,"" Byrne said in the statement. ""The decision is ultimately up to the people of Alabama to evaluate the information they have before them and make an informed decision. We must respect the voters' decision.""

Sen. Luther Strange, who lost to Moore in the Republican primary, did not respond to a request for comment from AP, but told The Washington Post recently that the election is up to voters.

""I'm staying out of it now. I think everybody knows how I feel about Judge Moore. We made our case and the voters made a different decision,"" Strange told the newspaper in a video on its website.

Sessions, who resigned from the Senate to join the Trump administration, declined to say how he would vote. Moore and Jones are competing for his old job.

""There have been some ads that may have suggested I endorsed a candidate, that is not so,"" Sessions said. ""I believe that the people of Alabama will make their own decision.""

State party loyalty rules could prohibit a GOP politician, or someone who aspires to be one, from publicly backing Moore's opponent. The rule says anyone who openly supports another party's nominee over a Republican could be barred from running as a Republican in the future.

Ivey became governor earlier this year after Robert Bentley resigned amid a sex scandal involving a much younger female political aide. When reached by the AP, Bentley declined to say who he is voting for Tuesday.

Ivey said last month that she has no reason to disbelieve the women who have accused Moore and is bothered by their allegations. But Ivey, who plans to run for governor in 2018, said she will vote for Moore anyway for the sake of GOP power in Congress. Her office did not respond to a request for an updated comment.

Another woman worked at an Atlanta restaurant and says her boss did...",2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,abc-news,Women say sexual misconduct common in hospitality industry,http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/hospitality-industry-sexual-misconduct-part-job-51701302,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_d01dc2e6f410402c8109ae0a085a56f2_16x9_992.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"One woman recalls how a general manager at a Chicago-area restaurant where she worked told her that if security cameras recorded him reaching between her legs and grabbing her genitals, he could simply ""edit that out.""

Another woman worked at an Atlanta restaurant and says her boss did nothing when two dishwashers kept making vulgar comments, so she quit wearing makeup to look less attractive and hopefully end the verbal abuse.

In the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against several prominent men in entertainment, politics and journalism, accounts like the ones these women share quietly play out in restaurants, bars and hotels across the country and rarely get the headlines.

Court documents and interviews with the women and experts on the topic show hospitality industry workers are routinely subjected to sexual abuse and harassment from bosses, co-workers and customers that are largely unchecked. The nature of the work, which often has employees relying on tips, can make them especially vulnerable to abuse.

""I was absolutely humiliated,"" said Sharonda Fields, who said the abuse at the Atlanta restaurant began shortly after she started working there last year. ""It was degrading. I felt embarrassed. I felt low. I just felt like nothing happened when those guys talked to me that way, and especially when the staff and the managers knew what was going on. It made me feel like dirt.""

She filed a lawsuit against the restaurant last spring. Calls to the restaurant from The Associated Press went unanswered.

Joyce Smithey, an Annapolis, Maryland, attorney who has handled several sexual harassment lawsuits, said those accused of misconduct ""have a great sense of who the victims are, who the women are who will put up with this, who need the job, are so scared they don't fight back.""

That's especially true in an industry where immigrants are a large part of the workforce. In a 2014 federal lawsuit in New York that was ultimately settled, a woman alleged that the general manager of a fast-food restaurant where she worked asked about her immigration status regularly and knew that she was ""even more vulnerable"" partly because she had no family in the United States.

Many accusers think fighting back is futile. According to a survey in Chicago, not only had 49 percent of hotel workers reported incidents in which guests ""exposed themselves, flashed them or answered the door naked,"" but just 1 in 3 of the workers who had such experiences reported it to a boss.

Sarah Lyons, a research analyst with UNITE HERE Local 1, the union that conducted the survey last year and represents more than 15,000 hospitality workers in the Chicago area and northwestern Indiana, said the most common reason these workers didn't come forward is because they knew someone who tried to report sexual misconduct and nothing changed as a result.

Often things can get worse for those who report misconduct. Attorneys and advocates for workers say waitresses who speak out risk facing retaliation: Their shifts can be taken away or they might be scheduled for slower business times when there are fewer opportunities to receive tips.

In a 2011 lawsuit against a Maryland yacht club, Victoria Tillbery reported that a boss had told her she would ""never have to worry about your shifts"" if she let him perform oral sex on her. She refused and after she reported her allegations to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, her job started making her do her prep duties during shifts and not before them. That took her away from waiting tables and earning tips.

Attorneys say the goal in these situations is to prompt the employee to quit and, if that doesn't work, the worker is often made the target of an effort to discredit her character.

After Fields, the Atlanta restaurant worker, refused to quit, ""false and bogus reasons to terminate her"" surfaced, her attorney said.

""They enlisted another employee to falsely state that she (Fields) had come up to her and said, 'If you agree to back me up on my claim I'll pay you $100,'"" said Fields' attorney, Brad Dozier.

The other worker, hoping to gain favor with the bosses and get a promotion, made the false claim and the restaurant used it to fire Fields, Dozier said.

The woman who recounted the story about the Calumet City, Illinois, restaurant general manager, who suggested he would edit security camera footage of him inappropriately touching her, said she rebuffed the man's advances. After that, Vger Williams said, a job opportunity she was promised at one of the restaurant chain's other locations never developed and she was fired.

Williams filed a lawsuit last month. Restaurant officials declined comment when reached by the AP.

Workers who are sexually harassed by customers are often under pressure to remain quiet, too.

David Craver, president of the National Bartenders Association, said companies don't want to lose business so ""they roll out the red carpet to every customer.""

""It's just like if a family member said something inappropriate, you can't get rid of family,"" he said.

A lot of harassment occurs in situations in which the workers are underpaid, said Saru Jayaraman, co-founder of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a national organization that works to improve industry conditions. She said managers often encourage waitresses to dress sexier to get more tips, which can lead to sexual misconduct. If the workers were paid more, they wouldn't have to rely on tips and the misconduct would decrease, she said.

Improvements have shown up in other ways. In October, following the lead of voters in Seattle the year before, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance requiring hotels to develop anti-harassment policies and to provide panic buttons to workers by next summer if they work alone in guest rooms.

Also in October, celebrity chef John Besh stepped down from the company he founded after 25 women alleged that male supervisors at Besh's New Orleans restaurants sexually harassed them. One woman says Besh pressured her into a sexual relationship, but Besh has said he believes it was consensual.

While suing is one way victims of misconduct can fight back, most settlements contain nondisclosure clauses that prevent them from talking about what happened to them. So the incidents are not publicized.

""It fosters the problem we are seeing so much of (because) these serial harassers, bullies and predators aren't talked about,"" Boston employment attorney James Weliky said.","national bartenders association

After a winter storm dumped the white stuff on parts of the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Friday, the mid-Atlantic, Northeast and New England were hit with heavy snow on Saturday. But as of Sunday morning, the storm is leaving the Northeast.

The Associated Press

Final snow totals in northern Georgia approached nearly one foot, while more than 10 inches of snowfall was reported in western North Carolina.

Farther north, in the Washington, D.C area, 2 inches of snow was reported at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, 2.6 inches was reported at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, and 4 inches was reported at Washington Dulles International Airport. All of the aforementioned figures are all new daily snow records.

The Associated Press

The Associated Press

While the storm may have left the South and East Coast, as of Sunday morning, 40,000 customers were still without power from Georgia to New Jersey. This is an improvement, though, from thenearly 275,000 outages on Saturday afternoon.

The South was hit with the first measurable snowfall to the region. In fact, there's more snow on the ground in parts of the South than Minnesota's Twin Cities have seen all season. There's only been 3.1 inches to date in the Twin Cities.

Now, back to the Northeast. The storm is pulling away from the Northeast Sunday morning. Snow will continue to taper off from west to east through the morning hours with much calmer weather expected through Sunday.

The main concern Sunday will be patches of ice from melting and refreezing of snow. Behind this storm, lake-effect snow will continue again Sunday across the Great Lakes region.

Upstate New York, from Buffalo to Watertown, may experience significant lake-effect snow, with up to 18 inches in the forecast. Travel delays in parts of New York State and Michigan are possible as a result.

Cold air is locked in place for much of the eastern U.S. Sunday morning. The most notable area of cold air is Florida, where wind chills in the central part of the state over the next few mornings will be in the 30s.

Looking farther north, very farther north, a disturbance will develop in southern Canada by late Sunday, and cross the border into the U.S. Northern Plains by Monday. This classic disturbance, called an Alberta Clipper, will bring some light snow from the Northern Plains to the Northeast from Monday to Tuesday. With the exception of enhanced lake-effect snow, accumulations from Alberta Clippers tend to be fairly light, though.

Expect a significant blast of cold air right behind the Clipper. Wind Chills spanning an area from the Midwest to the Northeast will be the coldest so far this season, with it feeling like the temperature is in the low teens in the I-95 corridor by Wednesday morning.

Over on the West Coast, the Santa Ana winds are expected to ramp up again Sunday morning and through the day on Sunday.

Gusts locally will exceed 50 mph through the hillsides and mountains. Relative humidity will be as low as 3 percent in some areas over the next several days -- not an ideal condition for battling the blazes.","ronald reagan washington national airport

Arab foreign ministers on Sunday demanded that the United States rescind President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, calling it a ""grave"" development that puts Washington on the same side as ""occupation"" and the violation of international law.

In a resolution long on rhetoric but short on concrete actions, the ministers also called for the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning Trump's decision, but acknowledged that Washington would most likely veto it.

If the U.S. vetoes the resolution, the Arabs would seek a similar resolution in the U.N. General Assembly, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki told a pre-dawn news conference in Cairo.

A two-page resolution adopted by the emergency meeting, which began Saturday night, did not include any punitive actions against the United States, like a call for a boycott of American products or suspending or downgrading ties with Washington.

It also appeared to fall short of matching the anger felt by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which have seen three days of violent protests against Trump's decision.

""We have taken a political decision not meant to reflect (what is going on in) the streets. Political work is responsible work,"" said Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. ""Jerusalem has been occupied for 50 years. This is an extended battle, a battle that will be escalated,"" he told the news conference.

The resolution said the ministers would meet again within a month and held out the possibility that an emergency Arab summit would be held in Jordan to discuss Jerusalem.

Trump's Dec. 6 announcement on Jerusalem, and his intention to move the U.S. Embassy there, triggered denunciations from around the world, with even close allies suggesting he had needlessly stirred more conflict in an already volatile region. Jerusalem's status lies at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Trump's move was widely perceived as siding with Israel. Even small crises over Jerusalem's status and that of the holy sites in its ancient Old City have sparked deadly bloodshed in the past.

Arab diplomats said some Arab League members had wanted a more hard-line resolution, including punitive measures against countries that follow the U.S. example and recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

That was considered too radical by moderate Arab nations and eventually dropped, according to the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.

But Al-Maliki, the Palestinian Foreign Minister, sought to play down differences, saying the meeting produced ""complete"" unity among Arab nations.

""There were differences in assessment when we moved to specifying measures,"" he said. ""But in the end we agreed on gradually escalating measures.""

Both Aboul-Gheit and Al-Maliki said Arab nations remained committed to a 2002 Arab peace plan that provides for recognition of Israel in exchange for lands occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

""That plan is a key reference in the Middle East peace process,"" Al-Maliki told the news conference.

Trump's decision, according to the Arab resolution, was ""illegal"" and a ""dangerous violation"" of international law. ""It's a dangerous development that places the United States at a position of bias in favor of the occupation and the violation of international law and resolutions.""

Israel occupied and later annexed the eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, declaring the holy city its eternal capital. Palestinians want that part to be the capital of their future state.

Trump's decision, said the resolution, also stripped the U.S. of its role as a ""sponsor and broker"" in the Mideast peace process, and ""undermines efforts to bring about peace, deepens tension and will spark anger that will threaten to push the region to the edge of the abyss of violence, chaos and bloodshed.""

The resolution adopted by the ministers reiterated that only the creation of an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital would end the Arab-Israeli conflict. It also mandated the Arab League to launch an ""international media campaign"" explaining the ""gravity"" of the American decision.

During a 2 ? hour session carried live on regional and local TV networks, the ministers gave speech after speech on the issue of Jerusalem, with comments ranging from blasting Trump's decision to the need for concrete action to musings on whether fiery speeches would change anything.

""If we do nothing about this one (Trump's decision), there will be many, many more tragedies,"" warned Iraq's foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari. ""No normalization (with Israel) and no compromises.""

Al-Jaafari later told reporters he thought the resolution did not match the seriousness of the situation over Jerusalem and that Baghdad would at a later date lodge its ""reservations"" with the Arab league.

Addressing the meeting, Lebanon's foreign minister, Gibran Bassil, suggested that there might be a silver lining in the latest crisis to hit an Arab world locked in conflict with Israel for nearly 70 years.

""Could this calamity bring us together and wake us from our slumber?"" he told the meeting.","israelipalestinian

Jewish groups condemned the attacks as ""unconscionable"" and demanded that authorities take action.

No one was injured in the attack late Saturday during a youth event at the synagogue and the adjacent Jewish center in Sweden's second-largest city. Goteborg police spokesman Peter Nordengard said Sunday it is being investigated as an attempted arson.

The attack took place after some 200 people rallied late Friday in the southern city of Malmo, yelling anti-Jewish slogans and waving Palestinian flags to protest U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Witness Allan Stutzinsky told the TT news agency he saw a dozen masked youths who threw what appeared to be firebombs into the garden surrounding the synagogue in Goteborg, but they failed to damage the building.

Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and other top politicians condemned the incidents and authorities increased security around the synagogue and at Jewish centers in Stockholm and Malmo.

""I'm terribly upset over the attack on a synagogue in Goteborg yesterday and calls for violence against Jews at a demonstration in Malmo,"" Lofven said Sunday. ""There is no place for anti-Semitism in our Swedish society. The perpetrators will be held accountable.""

He urged ""all democratic forces"" in Sweden to work together to create ""a tolerant and open society where everyone feels safe.""

On Saturday, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tweeted that those who called for Jews to be killed did something ""totally unacceptable.""

The European Jewish Congress said Sunday it was ""unconscionable that Jews are under attack on the streets of Europe"" and urged Swedish and other European governments to take ""strong punitive action"" against perpetrators.

In Nordic neighbor Finland, national broadcaster YLE said police would raise security measures around the Helsinki synagogue.

The American Jewish Committee, meanwhile, condemned a separate protest Friday in Berlin, during which American and Israeli flags were burned in front of the U.S. embassy.

The director of the AJC's Ramer Institute in Berlin, Deirdre Berger, called Sunday for an ""unequivocal response"" from German politicians, saying ""the protests have to be condemned.""

Berlin police said 10 people were detained and 12 criminal complaints were filed over the protest of Trump's decision to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Protesters filled central avenues and squares in a number of major international cities on Sunday, waving the flag of Palestine and shouting slogans to express their solidarity with the Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

US President Donald Trump's announcement on Wednesday drew near-universal condemnation from world leaders and inflamed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with violence flaring up in the occupied Palestinian territories for a fifth day.

According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, 157 people were injured on Sunday in confrontations with Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.

At least four Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the US declaration.

Clashes also erupted on Sunday at a protest in Beirut, where demonstrators fought with security forces outside the US embassy in the Lebanese capital.

Demonstrators set fires in the street, torched US and Israeli flags and threw stones at police officers, who responded with tear gas and water cannon.

Adnan Abdullah, a protester in Beirut, said Trump's Jerusalem decision ""will not happen as long as there are people like us"".

Another demonstrator, whose face was hidden behind a black mask, held up a tear gas canister and condemned Lebanese forces for ""defending America"".

{articleGUID}

He went on to add, ""There is no one by our side. None of the Arab countries. Oh God, we will raise the Palestinian flag""

Arab foreign ministers, in a resolution on Sunday, urged Trump to rescind the decision and have called for a UN Security Council condemnation of the shift in US policy.

Meanwhile, more than 5,000 Indonesians rallied outside the US embassy in Jakarta to vent their anger for a second day. Protesters carried Palestinian flags and banners saying ""Pray for Palestine"".

""We are not satisfied with just official statements,"" said Nurjannah Nurwani, one of the lead organisers of the gathering. ""We need follow-up, international lobbying which could pressure them into withdrawing their decision.""

Another female protester in Jakarta urged Trump to ""use his brain"" and ""withdraw from Jerusalem"".

Indonesian President Joko Widodo has condemned Trump's decision. On Thursday, he ordered the US ambassador in Jakarta to be summoned over the move.

In Turkey's Istanbul, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets again, transforming the city's Yenikapi Square into a sea of Turkish and Palestinian flags.

""I feel like I should defend Palestine because I don't know any other way to defend them,"" said Ananda Sereka, who was at the protest. ""So this is what I can do. This is the least I can do.""

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, one of the most vocal critics of Trump's move, has called the declaration ""null and void"" and vowed to fight it.

He has also called a summit of Islamic countries to discuss the move on Wednesday.

In Rabat, Morocco's capital, protesters yelled slurs against Trump and carried banners saying Jerusalem belonged to Palestine.

Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Rabat, said the protest was ""a show of solidarity with the Palestinian people but also an opportunity to express anger"" over Trump's decision.

""The protesters came from all walks of life,"" he said. ""Government officials, members of the opposition, seculars and conservatives - all denouncing what they consider to be a decision that could destabilise the region.""

Mohamed Boussaid, Morocco's finance minister, said the demonstration was a way ""to express our indignation and un-satisfaction"" and to show that ""we refuse completely the decision taken by the president of the US"".

Protester Mohamed Alghram agreed.

""We totally reject the decision that targets the most sacred place for us and we say no,"" he said. ""Jerusalem is a red line.""

Jerusalem is home to Islam's third holiest site and its status is deeply sensitive for Muslims.

In Indian-administered Kashmir, protesters took a different approach.

Residents of the capital Srinagar, home to 1.1 million people, closed their shops and abandoned the streets in protest. Salman Khan, a Srinagar resident, told the ANI news agency that Trump's decision was ""completely unjust"".

Muslim solidarity with Palestine also spread to the war-torn nations of Yemen and Syria.

Further protests were held in Egypt, where students and professors demonstrated at the Al-Azhar university.

In Pakistan's Karachi, hundreds of protesters marched towards the US Consulate in the city, but were turned back by riot police.","al jazeeras hashem ahelbarra

Five children in Eastern Ghouta have reportedly died, while 137 others require immediate medical assistance, UNICEF said in a statement on Sunday.

The children, aged seven months to 17 years, are unable to access medical help for conditions ranging from kidney failure and severe malnutrition to wounds sustained from conflict.

""The situation is getting worse day by day,"" said Fran Equiza, UNICEF's representative in Syria.

""The health system is crumbling and schools have now been closed for almost a month. Sick children desperately need medical evacuation and many thousands more are being denied the chance of a normal, peaceful childhood.""

{articleGUID}

Eastern Ghouta, 15 km from Syria's capital, has been surrounded by government forces for four years, with the siege escalating in recent months.

The estimated 400,000 people living there have been almost completely cut off from humanitarian assistance since 2013, according to UNICEF.

Nearly 12 percent of children under five in Eastern Ghouta suffer from acute malnutrition, the highest rate recorded since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011.

In a previous report, UNICEF said the rapidly increasing costs of basic foods and cooking supplies in Eastern Ghouta, where bread costs more than 85 times its price in Damascus, have made preparing a meal extremely difficult for most residents.

UNICEF workers, on the most recent UN inter-agency convoy to Nashabieh town in Eastern Ghouta, described ""one of the worst health and nutrition situations since the conflict began in Syria"".

In Sunday's statement, UNICEF reiterated its call for ""unimpeded, unconditional and sustained humanitarian access"" to children across Syria.

""Now is the time for all sides to do the right thing and to stop the violence,"" said Equiza.

Also on Sunday, the Syrian government's representatives returned, after more than a week in the Swiss city of Geneva, where the latest round of UN-sponsored talks is underway.

The discussions focus on Security Council Resolution 2254, which calls for a transitional government followed by elections.

Held for the eighth time, the talks are due to end on December 15.","fran equiza unicefs

Al Jazeera,French President Emmanuel Macron said he disapproves of the decision by the US to declare Jerusalem as Israel's capital.,2017-12-10T17:06:00Z,al-jazeera-english,US Jerusalem move dominates Macron-Netanyahu talks,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/jerusalem-move-dominates-macron-netanyahu-talks-171210170339962.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/12/10/748b8c520e0f446d94dbeb8109b4e1f4_18.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"French President Emmanuel Macron has criticised a US decision to call Jerusalem the capital of Israel, while urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the construction of illegal settlements.

In a joint press conference after meeting Netanyahu in the French capital, Macron urged the Israeli leader to negotiate with the Palestinians.

""France remains convinced that the only solution in accordance to international law is to enable the establishment of two states living side by side in peace - and this can only happen through negotiations,"" he said on Sunday.

""I invite the prime minister to make courageous gestures regarding the Palestinians and to overcome the current deadlock.""

Netanyahu's visit to Paris came four days after US President Donald Trump ignored widespread warnings by the international community as he recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and announced plans to move his country's embassy to the city.

The unilateral move was sharply condemned by leaders across the world, including in Europe, and led to deadly clashes across the occupied Palestinian territories and major protests elsewhere.

Commenting on Trump's decision, Macron expressed his deep disapproval because ""it contradicts international law"".

He also called on Israel to ""freeze settlement building"" as a gesture of peace.

But Netanyahu said that Trump's recognition merely recognised realities on the ground, adding that Palestinians must accept Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Netanyahu once again said Jerusalem has always been the capital of the state of Israel.

{articleGUID}

""The sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality, the sooner we'll move towards peace,"" he said at the press conference.

""This is why I think President Trump's announcement was so historic and so important for peace,"" he added, saying that there is a ""serious effort underway"" by the US administration ""on the quest for peace"".

Responding to Macron's calls for negotiations, Netanyahu said he has more than once reached out to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Al Jazeera's Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris, said there was no doubt that the decision on Jerusalem dominated the meeting between Macron and Netanyahu.

""Macron said that, for him, the only way forward is for Israelis and Palestinians to come together and address the question of Jerusalem in talks towards a two-state solution,"" she said.

""But it's very hard to see how the Israeli prime minister would want to go forward with that after the remarks he made today.""

European tour

Beyond the issue of Jerusalem, the two leaders discussed a series of other topics, including Iran's role in the Middle East.

{articleGUID}

Netanyahu called Iran ""the main source of aggression in the region"", saying it was building up its military capabilities in both Syria and Lebanon, and claimed that a number of Arab states were beginning to agree with this position.

""Many of the Arab countries now recognise that Israel is not their enemy, but their ally to fight the two main sources of terrorism in the region, namely Daesh [ISIL] and Iran.""

During the press conference, Macron announced he will visit Israel in 2018.

After visiting Paris, Netanyahu will travel to Brussels, where he is scheduled to meet Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief.

Just like Macron, Mogherini has been critical of the US decision to move the American embassy to Jerusalem and recognise the city as the capital of Israel.","mahmoud abbas al jazeeras natacha butler

Clare Wiley,"NGO Urban Light in Chiang Mai has reached 5,000 teenagers caught up in prostitution rackets in Thailand's second city.",2017-12-10T19:22:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Rescuing boys from Thailand's northern sex trade,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/rescuing-boys-thailand-northern-sex-trade-171210184544070.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/12/10/aa752f7656b547288f54ae5dd89c1273_18.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Chiang Mai, Thailand - Krit hangs out near McDonald's most days, polishing the hood of his green tuk-tuk and waiting for customers. He can make as much as 3,000 Thai baht ($92) in a day driving tourists around this northern city.

Several years ago when Krit was just 16, this picture was very different. His customers were still Western tourists, but they went to him for sex, not tuk-tuk rides. Krit was a victim of Thailand's sex-trafficking trade. For five years he worked in seedy bars and dingy massage joints in Chiang Mai's red light district. He endured cruelty and exploitation, forced to go home with the men who venture to these dark places to buy sex with children.

It was a horrific life that forced Krit to the brink; the teen was later hospitalised with HIV, and almost died. But he made a miraculous recovery and went on to set up his own tuk-tuk business.

""I feel independent because I can control my own life,"" says Krit, whose name has been changed to protect his privacy. ""I don't need money from customers in the bars. I have a new desire to change my life, to work hard and take care of myself. I feel lucky to be alive.""

Now Krit is teaching other teen boys - also sex-trafficking victims - to drive the noisy three-wheel taxis. He takes them to abandoned parking lots to practice changing gears and reversing. They practice English and learn how to read maps.

It's part of a project run by Urban Light, the only NGO in Thailand that supports male victims of sex trafficking. The country is a notorious destination for sex tourists, and has one of the highest rates of child prostitution in the world. But the plight of boys is much less understood.

Reliable numbers are difficult to come by with most research overlooking boys. The UN estimates that almost 30 percent of all trafficking victims are male, but this includes forced labour, not just sex trafficking. In Thailand there's a higher prevalence of young boys performing survival sex on the streets, according to the Global Slavery Index.

Urban Light founder Alezandra Russell insists that sex trafficking ""is now a multi-billion dollar industry that's affecting both genders"". Her organisation provides health check-ups, counselling, education and housing programmes - and has reached 5,000 boys in seven years.

Refuge

On a quiet afternoon here at the Urban Light centre, teen boys lounge around after a big lunch of homemade Pad Thai. Some nap or watch movies in the breakroom. Others play ping pong, lift weights and smoke cigarettes on the little rooftop. The boys are wary but friendly, smiling shyly. This is a safe space for them, a refuge.

Russell launched Urban Light after an eye-opening visit to Chiang Mai's red light district in 2009. The young American was there to research trafficking in an effort to support girls, but was shocked to see Western men sitting in bars with 14-year-old boys on their laps. When she tried to help, Russell was told, ""Save your time for the girls, those boys are just going to get HIV and die.""

""I got really pissed off,"" she says. ""I went back to the bars later that night."" The boys were curious about the only woman in the bar, and Russell gradually gained their trust by buying them bottles of coke, playing games and chatting about football in broken Thai. She felt distraught and helpless when one by one, customers came to buy the boys and take them away.

Russell visited the bars every night of her two-week trip. When she returned to her life in Washington DC, she couldn't stop thinking about what she'd witnessed. ""I sold my wedding ring and used that money to get back to Thailand and rent a little space in the red light district.""

Urban Light staff hand out condoms and fliers in bars and brothels in touristy areas of the city that seem innocuous enough, but are notorious spots for Western men (and increasingly Chinese and Thai men, Russell says) to find children for sale.

Poor and vulnerable

There's a widespread misconception that victims of sex trafficking are kidnapped and locked up, but the reality is more complex. ""They're not chained to the bars, but they have so much psychological pressure that keeps them in that lifestyle,"" says Russell.

Many of the boys are from northern Thailand's hill tribes: impoverished, uneducated and without official papers. Traffickers lure these vulnerable teens into bars with the promise of a salary, then trap them in a vicious cycle of drug addiction, debt and violence.

The ultimate goal, of course, is to remove these boys from the situations they're in, but Russell knows this has to be a decision the boys make themselves. ""We're really trying to show them that they have so much more potential than working in a bar or massage parlour, and that we can help them get there.""

Chaow was just 14 when he came to Urban Light. An orphan from a hill tribe community, he left school at 12 and took work in a Chiang Mai bar. He naively believed he'd only have to sell alcohol, and needed the money to send home.

""As the youngest, he inevitably was the one that all the men wanted,"" says Russell. ""He quickly realised what he was expected to do. For the next three years, he would live that life. As desperately as I wanted to get him out, I knew that he had to make that choice. One day he came to me in utter tears and said 'that's it, I'm done'. You could see the depression all over his face."" Urban Light helped Chaow get an apartment, finish school, and find work as a door-to-door salesman.

Equipping the boys with job skills is a crucial part of the organisation's work. In addition to the tuk-tuk programme, some boys are training to become barbers.

""These are alternative ways for them to become entrepreneurs, to make their own money, to be their own bosses and see how they can thrive,"" Russell says.","chiang mai thailand krit

Shatha Hammad,Three Palestinians who lived through the first uprising from 1987-1993 share their experiences.,2017-12-10T12:49:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Stories from the first Intifada: 'They broke my bones',http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/stories-intifada-broke-bones-171210111414673.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2010/8/31/2010831155918742734_20.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"It has been 30 years since the first Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, exploded onto the scene in the occupied territories.

The prevailing images of unarmed Palestinians throwing rocks at fully armed Israeli troops and military vehicles, which clearly showed the occupied and the occupier, were covered with unprecedented interest by international media.

These images and the uprising became symbolic of protest movements around the world.

How did the first Intifada come about?

On December 8, 1987, an Israeli vehicle ran over a car carrying four Palestinian workers in Jabalya refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip. The four Palestinians were killed, and the camp broke out in spontaneous protests, which rapidly spread across the remainder of the strip and into the West Bank.

Tensions had already been running high prior to the outbreak of protests, cultivated by a worsening political climate for Palestinians, in the form of a 1984 Israeli unity government between the right-wing and leftist camps. In addition to continuous land expropriation, Israel had total control of Palestinian social, economic and political development.

The six-year Intifada was characterised by popular mobilisation and mass protests. It was also saturated by civil disobedience, well-organised strikes, and communal cooperatives.

When Israeli occupation forces imposed long-running curfews on towns and cities, Palestinians ran underground universities, schools and clinics. Boycotts of Israeli products and businesses led to the emergence of a national economy fueled by homegrown goods and increased agricultural productivity.

According to Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, 1,070 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during the Intifada years, including 237 children. Jewish settlers also killed 54 Palestinians.

More than 175,000 Palestinians were also arrested in the same period, and 2,000 homes were demolished in Israel's systematic method of collective punishment.

Under Israel's then-defence minister Yitzhak Rabin's orders, Israeli army commanders were instructed to break the bones of Palestinian protesters. Today, this policy has evolved to specifically target the knees and legs of Palestinian youth to disable them.

Below, three Palestinians who lived through the Intifada share their experiences.

Wael Joudeh, 46, Iraq al-Tayeh village, Nablus

On February 26, 1988, 17-year-old Wael Joudeh and his cousin Osamah were returning home from grazing their sheep when they noticed a group of Israeli soldiers following them back to their village, east of Nablus.

As the soldiers caught up with them, they began beating them and for a period of 30 minutes, Israeli forces used stones to break their bones.

The incident was caught on video, and was the first documented incident that brought to light Israel's ""breaking the bones"" policy.

Today, Wael sits on the same rock he was pushed down on before he was beaten. As he sits there silently, he recalls the painful moments he thought were his last.

""At first, one of the soldiers took off his military hard-hat and started pounding it on my head until I fell to the ground. He then proceeded to beat me uncontrollably,"" Wael told Al Jazeera.

""Then he lifted me up, and shoved his helmet towards my face and shouted out what was written on it,"" he recalled.

""I was born to kill Palestinians,"" the soldier screamed at Wael.

""One of them twisted my arm against my back, while another started pounding my wrist with a stone, attempting to break my hand completely,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Osamah was attempting to escape, but was immediately dragged down by three Israeli soldiers and beaten on the ground.

""They were beating us with every ounce of their energy. They not only wanted to break our bones and to inflict physical pain on us, they also wanted to humiliate us and shatter our spirit,"" said Wael.

""The stones of Palestine were merciful,"" he recalled. ""That's why we survived.""

The pair were unaware, at the time, that a man in a building 200 metres away was documenting every moment of their painful ordeal.

Though women from the nearby village attempted to stop the attack, Israeli soldiers dragged Wael and Osamah to the vehicle that eventually transported them to Tubas' al-Faraa detention centre, in the occupied West Bank.

That night, an Israeli officer stormed into Wael's cell and asked, ""Are you the one whose bones were smashed by the soldier?""

""Now the whole world thinks you're dead,"" he told Wael.

The pair were then taken to a room in the detention centre, where they were surprised to see a crowd of journalists rushing towards them. Cameras were pointed at their faces while questions were being yelled out about the incident that had been caught on tape.

""We didn't know it was documented, we were in shock,"" said Wael, who spoke up about what happened to him.

Shortly after, the two were released because of the media pressure.

""We expected them to detain us again after the journalists left, but they didn't.""

This was not the first time Wael survived an abduction. On December 31, 1985, a group of Israeli settlers kidnapped him while he was on his way to school.

When Israeli forces intervened, they were quick to detain and interrogate him. At just 17, Wael was sentenced to seven months imprisonment.

Over a span of six years during the Intifada, Wael was arrested five times and spent varying periods in Israeli prisons and detention centres.

Now 46 years old, Wael works as an employee of the Palestinian Ministry of Finance. He got married in 1996 and has four children, two of whom are currently university students.

""I always tell my children what happened to me. I do not ever try to hide it,"" he said. ""They always tell my story to their colleagues and friends.""

Wael and Osamah are considered prominent icons of the first Intifada. What they went through sparked demonstrations and a grassroots uprising, that forced the Arab League into holding an emergency meeting regarding the fate of the people in the occupied Palestinian territories.

But Wael believes he and Osamah never got the respect they deserve.

""The people's respect is the most important thing, but unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority has not shown us any respect or appreciation,"" he said.

Khadija Abu Shreifa, 65, Jalazone camp, Ramallah

Khadija walks slowly, dragging her foot that had been injured when she was shot by Israeli soldiers.

Her children and grandchildren gather around her in her house in Jalazone camp, north of Ramallah, and she tells them the story of her struggle during the first Intifada.

She was a survivor of a time of terrible repression, a time when soldiers of the occupation did their utmost to suppress the Intifada. At their worst, they stopped differentiating between men and women, children and the elderly. Everyone was targeted similarly.

Khadija Abu Shreifa is a Palestinian refugee. Her family was forced out of their home in the village of Safriyya in 1948. They moved to the Aqabat Jabr camp in Jericho, then to the Wahdat camp in Jordan, and finally to the Jalazone camp after the war in September 1970.

Khadija, 65, does not remember the exact date, but she remembers every detail of the day. She remembers the men and women of Jalazone camp heading out in a large demonstration, that ended in violent suppression at the hands of Israeli forces who then spread throughout the camp.

""I heard one of the soldiers of the occupation verbally harassing a group of young girls, saying sexual things to them. That made me angry so I tried to confront him but he started cursing me and moved towards me to hit me, so I attacked him and started hitting him.""

{articleGUID}

Khadija told Al Jazeera an entire Israeli military squad attacked her, the soldiers beating her and pulling her hair. One of the soldiers shot her at close range, intending to kill her, but striking her with two bullets, one in the shoulder and the other in the foot. This made her the first person to be wounded in Jalazone camp during the first Intifada.

The women of the camp hurried to rescue Khadija from the Israeli soldiers. ""One of the women tore parts of her hijab off to bind my wounds. Then the people of the camp took me to the hospital in Ramallah, where an Israeli officer came to try to arrest me.

""But I was smuggled out of the hospital,"" she said.

Khadija added that the women of the camp went out to demonstrate and express their anger at the attack. Israeli forces suppressed the march violently, and 40 women were injured by rubber bullets.

As soon as Khadija returned to Jalazone, she was welcomed by residents with a big parade that marched her around the whole camp.

She was carried on their shoulders as she chanted ""No fear! No fear!"" - and the residents chanted with her.

This was not the end of Khadija's involvement; she continued her struggle along with the other women of the camp.

""The Israeli soldiers were always after the children; they would arrest them and beat them. Whenever I saw them arresting a child, I would pull him away from them, claiming that he was my son.""

During the first Intifada, Israeli forces often imposed a curfew, sometimes for as long as 40 consecutive days. When the curfew was that long, residents would run out of food in their homes, and that was when Khadija would venture out of the camp to fetch food and distribute it.

""I told the Israeli soldiers that my daughter was ill and needed medicine, and I got a permit to go out in our family's car. On my way back I filled the car with food and vegetables and distributed them to residents in the camp.""

The President of the Union of Palestinian Women's Committees, Khitam Saafin, told Al Jazeera that Palestinian women played important roles during the first Intifada.

Most important among these roles was the formation of committees, in various neighbourhoods, that would teach children during the general strikes that were in place during the first year of the Intifada.

Women played a central role in the demonstrations and confrontations with Israeli occupation forces. Saafin recalls women transporting stones to demonstrators on the front lines, and joining in to throw them at Israeli soldiers.

""Women also succeeded in preventing Israeli forces from arresting youth and children; they would fearlessly attack the soldiers and pull the child or young man away by force, so they were able to escape their clutches.""

She added the women's efforts were also successful in imposing a boycott on Israeli products and in producing a Palestinian alternative.

""Israeli products were stagnant in the shops, nobody was buying them … while Palestinian products were starting to replace them.""

Saafin also talked of a group of female neighbours who would meet regularly to produce local handmade products, as replacements for Israeli ones.

This was especially vital during the long curfew days, when getting to the markets was extremely difficult and dangerous.

""If someone had a small plot of land, they would volunteer it to the women who would plant it and make use of it. The women would do the planting and harvesting and distribute their crops to the people in their neighbourhood,"" she explained.

Abdullah Abu Shalbak, 49, al-Bireh, Ramallah

Graffiti was a resistance tool used during the first Intifada, where Palestinians - separated by the imposition of a curfew - would leave each other messages, said Abdullah Abu Shalbak from al-Bireh on the outskirts of Ramallah.

These messages, written on the walls of refugee camps and neighbourhoods across the occupied West Bank, were the only means of communication available at a time when modern-day mobile phone technology and the internet were not available.

Abu Shalbak was among the youth tasked with writing slogans on al-Bireh's walls. But this job was a difficult one, since they were targeted by Israeli forces.

Abu Shalbak, who was 19 years old during the first Intifada, told Al Jazeera that writing on the wall would only happen at night.

""Israeli forces would roam the streets during the day,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""They would also plant agents in the neighbourhoods.""

He added his faction would send messages to its members, who were structured in two-person teams. These usually announced a general strike, or simply extended congratulatory messages on the occasion of Eid holidays.

{articleGUID}

Sometimes the messages would serve the purpose of threatening Israeli forces and their agents who were present in al-Bireh.

Dressed with a keffiyeh covering their faces, Abu Shalbak and his partner would sneak out in the middle of the night to write their party's slogans on the walls of the town.

The day before an Eid holiday, Abu Shalbak and his friend were writing well-wishes on the walls in al-Bireh, when occupation forces raided the town and began pursuing them. The two young men had previously made a pact that should this happen, they would each run in opposite directions and then later meet at a specific location.

""The chances of us getting arrested was very high,"" Abu Shalbak said. ""We managed to run away and then meet up later, before I noticed my friend was injured and losing a lot of blood, after his leg caught on a fence he jumped over.""

Abu Shalbak called a doctor he trusted to treat his friend, and then took him to his home. Since the next day was Eid, his friend was afraid that his absence from the crowds of well-wishers would raise suspicions, since he was confined to his house because of his wounded leg.

For three years of the Intifada, Abu Shalbak continued to write slogans and graffiti on the walls. The Israeli forces never suspected him of being behind this act, even when he was finally detained.

""I was arrested by the Israeli special forces and was accused of throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at them,"" he said. ""I was subjected to harsh interrogation but they had no idea what it was that I really did.""

Abu Shalbak spent a few months in prison before his release. The Israeli army's pursuit of those who wrote political messages of the Palestinian factions and popular committees was not the only thing that bothered him.

He faced other obstacles, such as the anger of some people who did not want graffiti on the walls of their homes and scrubbed them off, out of fear of punishment by the occupation forces.

{articleGUID}

Other problems played out in the rivalry between Palestinian factions who would write over each other's graffiti. Furthermore, collaborators were tasked by their Israeli masters to paint over fresh messages on the wall before they were seen by residents of the neighbourhood.

Walls were not just for Palestinian graffiti. Occupation forces also used them to leave coded symbols for their collaborators.

""The Israeli army would draw a circle with a triangle inside of it,"" Abu Shalbak said. ""Inside the triangle would be another sign. This drawing represented the location and timing of where the soldiers would meet the collaborator.

""One of our missions was to also watch out for what the occupation forces would write on the walls, and to remove their messages quickly before their agent could see it.""

During the first Intifada's latter stages, Abu Shalbak joined the military wing of Hamas, and established the movement's first military cell in the West Bank. He was arrested by Israel again, and this time sentenced to 21 years in prison.

Abu Shalbak obtained a degree in the Hebrew language during his years in prison. When he was released as part of the 2011 prisoners' swap, he enrolled in Hebron University and got his undergraduate degree in the same field.

Today, he is a recognised instructor and offers Hebrew courses, especially to employees in Palestinian government institutions.","palestinian ministry of finance

David Child,"2017 Nobel Peace Prize winner ICAN is calling for ""a different kind of debate around nuclear disarmament"".",2017-12-07T06:16:00Z,al-jazeera-english,Nuclear weapons: In conversation with ICAN,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/nuclear-weapons-conversation-ican-171207055118368.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/12/7/d8db556397a44526a94214eaa1f10c56_18.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The 2017 Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) for the campaign's ""ground-breaking efforts"" to secure a prohibition on such weapons.

In July, ICAN was at the forefront of international efforts to establish a global agreement against the development, and use, of nuclear weapons. Their work led to the creation of the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which to date has 50 signatories, including Brazil, South Africa and Vietnam.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee, recognising this achievement, has praised ICAN for ""its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons"".

Ahead of the December 10 ceremony in Oslo, Al Jazeera spoke to Rebecca Johnson, founding co-chair of ICAN and member of the organisation's International Steering Group, about the campaign, current challenges and aspirations for the future.

Al Jazeera: What does winning the Nobel Prize mean for ICAN?

Rebecca Johnson: We see the Nobel Peace Prize as being a way to give a spotlight to the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and encourage ICAN to get the job done.

It will help to publicise what we are doing so that people around the world want to be part of ICAN and get their countries on board to sign the treaty as well.

Having the Nobel as well as the treaty, we are re-energised.

We were working on a shoestring budget, but now have more opportunities to raise funds and focus those into our campaigners in the countries and regions that we need to prioritise in terms of signing up to the agreement, which include those with nuclear arms or which are part of nuclear alliances.

Our role is to raise awareness and to focus arguments so that campaigners on the ground can persuade their own governments that this is a treaty they should join.

We need to change the conversation about nuclear weapons in those countries, highlighting the risks and insecurity they bring.

Al Jazeera: Is there a renewed sense of danger about the use, and potential impacts, of nuclear weapons within the international community?

Johnson: From the very beginning, ICAN has always said: ""Don't delude yourselves, there are no safe hands for these dangerous, abhorrent and unsafe weapons.""

Now the rest of the world is seeing that more clearly - when they see Donald Trump in the White House and Kim Jong-un in North Korea trading very irresponsible threats to nuke each other, or to nuke places in their vicinity, and seeming to be unaware how catastrophic the consequences of that would be.

People thought the end of the Cold War meant nuclear weapons were being dealt with, but with Trump and Kim Jong-un and all these instabilities, with nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, Israel with nuclear weapons in the Middle East, the deterioration of relations between Russia and the West - with these and other flashpoints that could erupt, people are saying ""the political situations are bad enough, we don't want nuclear weapons in that mix"".

We don't want Trump to be able to decide at 3am in the morning to fire off a nuclear weapon instead of a tweet. We can't play Russian roulette with nuclear weapons; they're too dangerous.

Al Jazeera: What is ICAN's stance on the Iran nuclear deal?

Johnson: I think it [the Iran nuclear deal] was one of the successes of both the Obama approach and the European Union, together with Russia and China, to be able to bring Iran to the negotiating table. [The deal was agreed to by Iran, China, France, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and the EU in July 2015.]

They created a deal that at least addressed most, if not all, of the drivers underpinning the value that Iran was attaching to having a free hand with what it called its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes, but which had all the elements of a programme that could be weaponised at a certain point further down the road.

The Iran nuclear deal was not perfect, but it created a mechanism for confidence-building and also for monitoring.

Trump has come along, understood none of that, and played fast and loose with the deal, which is extremely dangerous because with a country like Iran, it's very difficult to get them back to the negotiating table if a deal has been broken.

Al Jazeera: How has nuclear weapons testing impacted global health?

Johnson: For many years, the humanitarian impacts of the nuclear testing programmes were swept under the carpet.

The leaders of the countries doing the testing knew that the explosions were very, very harmful. That's why they conducted the testing as far from their own centres of population as they possibly could: so France tested first of all in Algeria and then in the Pacific; Russia tested in Kazakhstan and on an Arctic island called Novaya Zemlya; and the UK and United States did most of their nuclear testing in the Pacific, or underground in areas like Nevada.

I don't think they meant to deliberately harm indigenous people [of those areas]; they just didn't really care, as long as it wasn't their own cities [being affected].

What we are seeing in those indigenous communities are effects like cancer and birth problems that filter down into the next generation, and sometimes the generation after that … The impacts do continue to move through time and space.

[But] due to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the nuclear testing programmes have by and large finished; the only country still testing is North Korea.

So we are now focusing on what we can do to make the damage less harmful for the generations who are suffering the impacts of use and testing, and our primary aim is to make certain no more nuclear detonations of any kind, not use, tests, or accidents even, should take place. [Some 2.4 million people worldwide will eventually die from cancers due to atmospheric nuclear tests conducted between 1945 and 1980, according to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation.]

Al Jazeera: What's next for ICAN?

Johnson: We have two streams of priorities.

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons needs to have 50 countries sign and ratify it.

Often ratification means that a treaty has to go through various parliamentary and legal processes within each country and all of those are different, but the sooner the treaty enters into force, the stronger it will be and the more it will be able to do the work of reducing nuclear dangers worldwide.

So we are looking at the countries that are already signatories, while trying to increase that base, and working with those governments to ensure they can get the treaty ratified in order to allow it to enter into force.

The second set of challenges is to unlock a different kind of debate around nuclear disarmament in each of the nine nuclear-armed countries [US, Russia, China, France, England, Israel, Pakistan, the UK and North Korea], and show that they will be safer and more secure if they eliminate their arsenals and join the treaty.","comprehensive test ban treaty organisation al jazeera

Jonathan Cook,Analysts fear Trump's rubber-stamping of the right's political goals will further radicalise both sides of the divide.,2017-12-10T12:50:00Z,al-jazeera-english,How will US Jerusalem move affect Israel's far right?,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/jerusalem-move-affect-israel-171210122104793.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/12/6/d2c18d2979214dada930958b05506007_18.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Jerusalem - Trump's recognition this week of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, overturning seven decades of US policy in the region and effectively ending hopes of a two-state solution, has provoked dire warnings.

But the focus by commentators on Palestinian reactions, rather than the effect on the Israeli public and leadership, might have underestimated the longer-term fallout from Trump's move, analysts say.

Predictions have included the threat of renewed violence - even an uprising - from Palestinians; the possible collapse of the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinians' government-in-waiting, and its diplomatic strategy for two states; and the demise of Washington's claim to be serving as a credible peacemaker.

But according to analysts, more far-reaching - and disruptive - undercurrents will likely be set in motion by Trump's decision.

Few have factored in the likely effect of Trump's new Jerusalem policy on the Israeli public, which has been shifting steadily to the right for most of the past two decades. The city and its contested holy sites have gained an increasingly powerful religious and national symbolism for many Israeli Jews.

The fear is that Trump's effective rubber-stamping of the right's political goals in Jerusalem will further radicalise both sides of the divide - and accelerate processes that have been turning a long-standing national conflict into a more openly religious one.

'Tipping point'

""We may remember this date as the tipping point, as the moment when a new consensus emerged in Israel behind the idea of total Jewish supremacy,"" journalist David Sheen, an expert on Israel's far-right movements, told Al Jazeera.

Similar concerns were expressed by Yousef Jabareen, a Palestinian member of Israel's parliament.

""We can expect to see a move rightwards across Israeli society,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""The centre-left parties were already tacking much closer to the right. They will now want to align themselves with Trump's position. Meanwhile, the right will be encouraged to move to the extreme right.""

Both noted that Avi Gabbay - the recently elected leader of the Zionist Union, the official opposition and the party that was once the backbone of the Israeli peace camp - had begun espousing positions little different from those of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Last week, Gabbay backed Trump's announcement, saying that recognition of Jerusalem was more important than a peace deal with the Palestinians.

Sheen said that traditionally, the centre-left had been restrained in its political positions by concerns about alienating the United States: ""Netanyahu has shown that he can bring the US round to his way of thinking by staying the course. In many Israelis' eyes, he has now been proved right. The centrists may decide it is time to come onboard. Allying with the Republican right and the Christian evangelicals in the US may now look like a much safer bet.""

The possible effects of Trump's announcement on Israelis have been largely overlooked, even though previous turning points in the conflict have consistently resulted in dramatic lurches rightwards by the Israeli public.

Given Israel's power over the Palestinians, these changes have played a decisive role in leading to the current impasse between Israel and the Palestinians, analysts note.

Most obviously, Israel's seemingly ""miraculous"" victory in the 1967 war, defeating the armies of neighbouring Arab states in six days, unleashed a wave of Messianic Judaism that spawned the settler movement.

A new religious nationalism swept parts of the Israeli public, driving them into the occupied Palestinian territories to claim a supposed Biblical birthright.

Other major events have had a decisive effect too. Unexpectedly, the Oslo peace process, launched in the mid-1990s, persuaded many non-religious Israeli Jews to move into settlements in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem, doubling the numbers there in a few years.

Into the arms of the far right

Alan Baker, a legal adviser to the Israeli foreign ministry in that period, explained Israelis' peculiar reading of the Oslo Accords. In their view, Oslo meant Israel was ""present in the territories with their [the Palestinians'] consent and subject to the outcome of negotiations"".

In other words, many Israelis believed that the Oslo process had conferred an international legitimacy on the settlements.

Later, in 2000, after the Camp David summit collapsed without the sides agreeing to a two-state solution, Ehud Barak, Israel's then-prime minister, blamed Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians. He said they were ""no partner"" for peace.

As a result, Israelis deserted the peace camp and drifted into the arms of the right and far-right. Netanyahu has reaped the benefits, leading a series of ultra-nationalist governments since 2009.

Now Trump's decision on Jerusalem effectively gives Washington's blessing to Israel's illegal annexation of East Jerusalem and five decades of creating facts on the ground there, said Jabareen.

""Trump has legitimised the far-right's argument that Israel can control all of Jerusalem by sheer force, by denying Palestinians their rights and by creating facts on the ground,"" he said.

With their policy of aggressive unilateralism now paying dividends in the US, the settlers and the ultra-nationalists were unlikely to be satisfied with that success alone, he added. ""The danger is that the religious right's narrative will now seem persuasive at other sites in the occupied territories they demand, such as Hebron and Nablus.""

Since Trump's election a year ago, Naftali Bennett, the Israeli education minister and the leader of the main settler party, has begun calling for Israel to seize the opportunity to annex West Bank settlements.

Pressure is likely now to mount rapidly on Netanyahu to shift even further to the right.

On the 972 website, Noam Sheizaf, an Israeli analyst, observed that Trump's declaration had boosted the settlers' position that ""in the long run 'facts on the ground' are more important than diplomacy and politics, and that Israel will eventually win legitimacy for its actions"".

Effects in Jerusalem

The most immediate effects, according to Ir Amim, an IsraeIi human rights organisation, will be felt in Jerusalem itself. Government ministers have already drafted legislation to bring large West Bank settlements under Jerusalem's municipal authority, as a way covertly to annex them.

There are also plans to strip large numbers of Palestinians of their Israeli-issued Jerusalem residency papers because they live outside the separation wall Israel built through the city more than a decade ago. That would cement a new, unassailable right-wing Jewish majority in Jerusalem.

Last week, Ir Amim warned in a statement that Trump's move would be certain to ""embolden"" such actions by the Israeli right and provide a ""tailwind"" to those determined to pre-empt a two-state solution.

Assad Ghanem, a politics professor at Haifa University, told Al Jazeera: ""Trump has given a legitimacy to the right's Messianic agenda. He has adopted the language of the extreme right on Jerusalem - that it is Israel's eternal, united capital. The far-right will declare this a victory.""

In parallel, Trump's seal of approval for Israel's takeover of Jerusalem is likely to intensify the city's religious symbolism for Jews - and the importance of Israeli sovereignty over al-Aqsa Mosque compound, Ghanem noted.

In recent years, a growing number of rabbis have been overturning a centuries-old consensus that al-Aqsa compound is off-limits to Jews because it was not known where the ruins of an earlier Jewish temple lay. In Jewish tradition, it is forbidden to walk over an inner sanctum, known as the Holy of Holies.

Today, Jews regularly enter the compound and some even pray there. Settler rabbis and far-right government ministers have called for dividing the compound between Israelis and Palestinians, creating huge tensions with Palestinians.

Temple movements

Meanwhile, a once-fringe movement of Jewish supporters who wish to destroy the mosque to rebuild the ancient Jewish temple in its place, are gradually moving into the mainstream. Trump's move will be a shot in the arm to their ambitions and their credibility, said Sheen, who has studied the temple movements.

He pointed out that immediately after Trump's declaration, these groups had uploaded a cartoon of Trump standing in al-Aqsa compound, in front of the golden-topped Dome of the Rock, imagining the Jewish temple in its place. Trump is shown saying in Hebrew: ""This is the perfect spot!""

Sheen said: ""This will be treated as a call to arms by these groups.""

Will the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital have similarly dramatic long-term effect on Palestinians' public opinion? Analysts believe it will. The lack of an outpouring of significant anger - even after Palestinian leaders called for three days of rage last week - could be deceptive.

Israeli analysts have suggested that there is often what they term an ""incubation period"" - a delay between a major change in Israel's favour and a popular reaction from Palestinians. That was true of the second Intifada, which came months after the collapse of the Camp David summit.

An expectation of knee-jerk anger to Trump's decision may be misplaced, say analysts. The decision may result in a slower and much deeper process of adjustment to the new reality.

""Palestinians will now have to abandon the old tools of national struggle, because they have been shown to be ineffective. We need new tools of resistance, and that will require a grassroots struggle. We need a return to mass protests,"" Jabareen said.

Ghanem noted the danger that, with the likely growth of a Jewish religious extremism in Israel and among the settlers, some Palestinians might drift towards violence.

But he expected that a more significant trend would be Palestinians reassessing the end goal of their struggle and opting for mass civil disobedience.

""The two-state solution is obviously now finished, and that is likely to mobilise a new generation to struggle for a single state,"" he said. ""Activists and the leadership will need to rebuild Palestinian nationalism.""","the

For eight months between mid-November and August, Agariya people live in the desert, working under extreme weather conditions, helping to produce about 76 percent of India's salt.

They have been salt producers for generations, and consist today of around 10,000 families, comprising 45,000 people, mostly located in the Rann of Kutch region.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has projected Gujarat as a model of development worth emulating at the national level. He ran the state government for nearly 13 years until 2014.

But the model, which has been said to work on the pillars of electricity, water and sanitation for all, has provided none of these for the Agariyas.

Few signs of development

Even though long electric lines cover the Little Rann, the Agariya homes are still without electricity, with few visible signs of the development that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claims.

""In Maliya [in Morbi district] itself, there is no waste disposal system, no proper school, no electricity most of the time,"" said Ramesh Katesiya, a social worker from Anandi, a local NGO working among the community.

""There was a bus stand that got destroyed in the 2001 earthquake in Bhuj. They still have not reconstructed that,"" said Katesiya, referring to the village closest to where the Agariyas of Morbi district live.

""He has never even been here to see which people actually live and contribute to Gujarat's apparent progress,"" he added, referring to Modi, who has extensively campaigned during the state elections.

Many Agariyas with whom Al Jazeera spoke expressed their anger against the ruling BJP party, which has been in power for most of the last 21 years.

Overlooked by the political class for decades, the Agariyas now show little enthusiasm in the election process. This year, an election campaign held by the District Collector in Surendranagar district has raised awareness of the importance of political participation.

There are no hospitals within close reach of the Agariyas, or routine check-ups by state officials to ensure their health.

In Morbi, the nearest government hospitals are 20 to 100 kilometres away from the salt farmers. There are no roads or public transport that lead inside the Rann, leaving the Agariyas stranded in times of medical emergency.

""The Agariyas live for eight months a year without electricity, basic shelter and any medicine,"" Katesiya said. ""Because of their laborious work, they are prone to high fevers, tuberculosis, dehydration and severe skin burns during the summer months. In the last election, the BJP won all eight seats in this region, but still, they [the government] did nothing to help the people here. Because of that, the opposition [Congress party] has begun to gain a stronghold in these parts.""

Makeshift camps

It is December, and the salt season has just begun. The sand is being pumped for brine by machines that run on diesel. The brine will then be distributed into channels, where it will cook for three months to become salt.

Because of the lack of roads and public transport into the desert, the Agariyas are forced to live in makeshift camps in the desert for eight months of the year.

Savita Dhirubhai Koli, like other members of her community, works on land of about four hectares for 12 to 14 hours a day.

During the rains, the desert sand turns into a heavy marsh, making walking or riding a motorcycle on it difficult.

""It has been a month since we arrived,"" said Koli, who lives in a hut made from jute bags and tarpaulin in Gulbadi, a stretch of desert in the Morbi district. ""I just finished building the house, but now that it has rained, it is very wet, and water has already settled inside.""

During the rains, water seeps in easily, and a strong wind destroys many Agariya homes.

In winters, temperatures are as low as 2 degrees, but the Agariyas, along with their children, continue to live in these desert huts that offer no protection from extreme weather conditions.

""We have nothing to keep warm,"" said Raju, a salt farmer from the Agariya community from the Morbi district, around 10 kilometres from the Arabian Sea. ""I have three small children. They always get sick. But what can I do?""

Salt farmers mostly work as labourers employed by middlemen or large salt firms. They make Rs 25-35 ($0.40-$0.50) for each tonne of salt they produce.

Before the season begins, the Agariyas take a loan from an informal credit system called ""dhiraan"", which they pay back at the time of harvest.

At the end of eight months, they produce around 3,000 tonnes - for which, after their loan has been deducted, they make only around Rs 40,000 ($600).

""Players like Dev Salt drain the backwaters with their large machines,"" said Marut, an activist with the Agariya Rashtriya Heet Manch (AHRM). ""It is a threat to the smaller farms like the ones in Haripar.""

State support 'absent'

This July, severe floods hit Gujarat - and in Maliya alone, 30,000 tonnes of salt was washed away. The erratic rains have also delayed the production season, causing the Agariyas to worry that they may have to work extra days in the coming winter months.

While Agariyas were landowners in the past, the declaration of the Little Rann as Wild Ass Sanctuary in 1978 established that the government would own all the land.

""This has reduced previously land-owning Agariya families to positions of tenancy,"" said Pankti Jog, an activist with the AHRM. ""But even then, state support or assistance on this land or the process is absent.""

In Haripar in Morbi district, closer to the highway, mobility is easier than in other parts of the Rann. Of the around 1,500 Agariyas who work here, some have solar panels and can go back to nearby villages in case of extreme weather.

But even here, hospitals are at least 20 kilometres away, and there are no schools anywhere in sight.

""The district collector told us if we collect children, he will help us make a temporary school,"" said Sunita, an Agariya who lives in Haripar. ""But even if we do, where will they make the school? Who will come to teach here in the middle of the desert?""

The Agariya literacy rate is close to zero, leaving no opportunities for social mobility for the next generation.

""Our children begin working when they are 10 years old,"" said Ramesh, Sunita's husband. ""If we don't produce enough, the buyers will go to someone else, so we have to keep him happy.""

Areas of the Little Rann are also called Survey Zone Zero, as no census has been conducted here since Indian independence from the British colonial rulers in 1947.

""The absence of a census, or proper data on the Agariyas, makes it hard to know what they go through and what they need,"" Jog said. ""Including the Agariyas is a matter of state governance, which has not been done until now.""

Maintaining hope

In Morbi district, there is hope among the Agariyas that a new government, unlike the present BJP, may listen to their concerns.

""We will tell them we need roads, so we don't have to live out here in the cold, and education for our children,"" Ramesh said. ""If the (BJP) government can build tall, expensive buildings in the city, why can't they spare some money for our roads and homes?""



While one official in Haripar has promised to send a car to bring Agariyas to the polling station, in Gulbadi and the Rann surrounding Surendrangar district and faraway settlements, no such arrangements have been made. Moreover, the declaration of the Little Rann as a sanctuary prohibits mobile voting booths to enter it, making it impossible for Agariyas far away to participate.

""The ones who live 30 to 50 kilometres away will try to come,"" Jog said. ""But those 100 kilometres or so away from their villages, how will they go to vote?""

On December 9, some Agariyas will come to vote in the first phase of the elections, travelling by vehicle from the nearest possible point, and others - the more resilient - will walk.

""If I can work for 14 hours in the sun, I can walk 15 kilometres to cast a vote,"" said Kumar, who lives in Gulbadi. ""It is possible that nothing changes with any new government. But we have to make them notice us; maybe that will be a start.""","the

Sam Machkovech,"Four of the 12 games will have full online support, plus tons of features.",2017-12-11T01:00:40+00:00,ars-technica,Every classic Street Fighter will land in a huge anthology in May 2018,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/every-classic-street-fighter-will-land-in-a-huge-anthology-in-may-2018/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sfanthology-logo-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"During a major annual tournament for the fighting game Street Fighter V, the series' creators at Capcom announced the biggest anthology ever for the series—if not for Capcom as a game maker. On Sunday, the developers interrupted their Capcom Cup event to unveil the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, which will combine a giant set of games, a bunch of features, and an ambitious every-system-simultaneous launch in May 2018 for $39.99.

The primary selling point of this set is that it will finally combine every mainline, sprite-based Street Fighter game in one anthology. Capcom counts that as 12 games. The timeline starts with Street Fighter (no number—this is the 1987 original with only Ken and Ryu selectable), and it continues with every version of Street Fighter II, Street Fighter Alpha, and Street Fighter III. (Sorry, Pocket Fighter and Street Fighter: The Movie game fans.)



























What's more, Capcom will deliver full online support for four entries in the anthology: Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, Super Street Fighter II: Turbo, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and Street Fighter III: Third Strike. All four of those titles will support casual and ranked matches, along with four-person lobbies. They will also support a vaguely described ""rewind"" feature to let players fine-tune input timing to contend with any latency issues. (We'll have to see whether this actually lets players rewind matches to test, or if it's just like other fighting games' latency-adjustment meters.)

The full package, which also includes a meaty concept-art gallery, a comprehensive series timeline, a music player, and the ability to save and freeze your game at any time via ""save states,"" will launch on May 2018 on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC via Steam.

In recent years, many, but not all, of this anthology's games have launched on various systems as self-contained purchases. Street Fighter Alpha's trilogy is the biggest exception, as its three entries have languished since launching on the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast around the turn of the century, while all five SFII arcade entries have yet to launch in an easy, play-and-compare anthology.

Nintendo Switch owners who bought this year's Ultra Street Fighter II may feel miffed, seeing as that game also cost $39.99 and was, you know, only one title. But its remastered elements are not coming to this 2018 anthology, and it will continue to exclusively host Evil Ken as a playable SFII character. So, take that as you will, Street Fighter completists.","version of street fighter ii street fighter alpha

If our 11-part series on the history of the Amiga and our (in-progress) seven-part series on the history of the Apollo program don't give it away, we happen to be unabashed fans of a certain computing platform and a certain space program around the Ars Orbital HQ. So this week, a small post at HotHardware inevitably caught our eye: an old NASA-used Amiga evidently ended up for sale on eBay. Further Reading The Greatest Leap, Part 1: How the Apollo fire propelled NASA to the Moon

Seller vrus currently lists an Amiga 2500 used by NASA's Telemetry Lab for sale. How can anyone be certain this 1980s workhorse came from the US government? Well, the device is emblazoned with NASA property seals that seem to match tags found on other decommissioned NASA hardware. vrus also includes screenshots of programs on the computer that appear to be registered to a Dave Brown (HotHardware notes Brown was a principal programmer at Cape Canaveral's telemetry lab in the 1990s as per a 1999 Q&A with NASA retiree Hal Greenlee and comments from Greenlee in the ""Amigas at NASA"" video below).

Ars sent a note to NASA asking about general Amiga usage and the decommissioning process for hardware, and we'll update this piece if we receive more details in the coming days.

For now, vrus sent Ars a bit of additional background on the acquisition. The user has been a fan of Commodore and Amiga since 1982, proudly starting with the C64 and fondly remembering time with the Amiga 100 later on. vrus now collects and trades Amiga/Commodore equipment, so the user came across this particular machine by luck when purchasing several boxes of Amiga hardware and software in bulk. Further Reading A history of the Amiga, part 11: Between an Escom and a Gateway

""It had been in storage for several years so it was probably acquired when NASA decommissioned most of their Amigas in 2006,"" vrus wrote. ""Normally I would keep something like this for my own collection because it is so unique and interesting, but I thought it would be better if it ended up somewhere that other people could see it / use it / etc... I am glad I was able to save it; I suspect all the equipment would've ended up in a recycling plant.""

The Amiga 2500 was an iteration of the Amiga 2000 that simply came bundled with a Motorola 68020 or 68030-based accelerator card according to the archivists at Old-Computers.com. (The original Amiga 2000 debuted as a high-end machine for Commodore back in 1985, and it's perhaps most fondly remembered for enabling the famed Video Toaster app.) vrus details programming files dating back to 1988 on the advertised Amiga 2500, so that would coincide well with the machine's heyday (Old-Computers.com lists the A2500 as a 1989 product).

Prices for an Amiga 2500 at the time seemed high—the Canadian PC Museum lists it as selling for $3,800+ CAD ($3,000+) in the late 1980s. Considering that, maybe this in-progress eBay auction's surge past $5,000 isn't so absurd (both wear and tear and potentially unique history notwithstanding).

Megan Geuss,"Perry said 60-day deadline was reasonable, but new decision is now due January 10.",2017-12-10T19:30:59+00:00,ars-technica,"Energy Secretary Perry agrees to extension on pro-coal, nuclear rulemaking",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/energy-secretary-perry-agrees-to-extension-on-pro-coal-nuclear-rulemaking/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-632097372-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"On Friday afternoon, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the US energy regulator could take an extra 30 days to make a decision on a proposed rule that would boost struggling coal and nuclear power in the US.

Further Reading US Energy Secretary takes 22-minute prank call from “Ukrainian Prime Minister” Perry proposed a rule in late September that would require grid operators to change how they value “reliability and resilience attributes” in energy generation. Specifically, generation plants with such attributes were defined by the Energy Secretary as plants that could keep a 90-day supply of fuel onsite. Although the proposed rule was written to appear energy-agnostic, it clearly favors coal and nuclear plants. Natural gas tends to be delivered by pipeline and is rarely stored onsite in large quantities, and wind and solar energy have free but variable fuel sources, though pioneers in the field are trying to mitigate this with the help of stationary storage.

Without government intervention, coal has become more expensive to burn compared to natural gas in many areas. It's also a major contributor to climate change, something the president has falsely called a hoax.

The five-person Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) must sign off on the rule for it to take effect. FERC was originally given a 60-day deadline to study the rule, gather public comment, and make a decision on whether to institute it, but Chairman Kevin McIntyre requested an extension Friday morning after he was sworn into his position, according to Utility Dive. Acting Chairman Neil Chatterjee, who held McIntyre’s spot before his promotion to chairman, was vocal about his support for the proposed rule, even suggesting an interim solution that would require regional grid operators to make short-term payouts to at-risk coal and nuclear plants. But commissioners Cheryl LaFleur and Robert Powelson have been critical of the rule, arguing that more-expensive coal and nuclear are already compensated by the market for continuous power delivery when they get paid high prices for energy during times of energy scarcity. Powelson even said in October that the rule would “destroy the marketplace.”

The rule has been seen as a direct extension of Trump campaign promises. When Energy Secretary Rick Perry was sworn into office, one of his first actions was to commission a “baseload energy” study, in which Perry claimed that regulatory burdens created by the Obama Administration had reduced coal-fired generation and “destroyed jobs and economic growth,” in addition to threatening to “undercut the performance of the grid well into the future.”

The commissioned report did not reflect the same unsubstantiated political hyperbole, but delivered the Energy Secretary enough to justify the proposed rule. The baseload report recommended that power markets revise how they value coal and nuclear power, but it also pointed out that low natural gas prices, rather than the previous administration’s policies, were the culprit in recent coal and nuclear closures. The study also suggested that reliability of the US grid could be enhanced by supporting research on grid resilience during extreme weather events and fuel price shocks. (Fuel stockpiling doesn’t necessarily address these concerns, as coal plants were temporarily converted to natural gas in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey when coal piles were flooded, and nuclear plants are taken offline regularly for maintenance and occasionally in anticipation of hurricanes.

In his Friday letter to FERC (PDF), Perry told the commission that he had expected urgent action on the rule, “in light of serious threats to the nation’s electricity grid,"" referring to his September letter (PDF) citing ""premature retirements"" of coal and nuclear plants. However, Perry granted a 30-day extension for FERC to continue deliberating the rule. Now, a decision is expected no later than January 10, 2018, although FERC could issue a decision earlier than that. During the 30-day extension, Perry said that the Department of Energy would review how it could ""take remedial action as necessary to ensure the security of the nation's electric grid.""","fiveperson federal energy regulatory commission ferc

That driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015. That same year, the victim sued Uber in federal court in San Francisco and reached a confidential settlement with the company.

However, in June 2017, she sued Uber again, as Ars reported at the time. The woman alleged that Eric Alexander, Uber's then-vice president for business in Asia, went to Delhi and ""managed to obtain Plaintiff's confidential, private medical records generated by physicians who examined her after the brutal rape.""

The complaint goes on to claim that Alexander shared the records with then-CEO Travis Kalanick and Emil Michael, an Uber executive who was fired shortly after the June lawsuit. According to the complaint, the men ""discussed the records among themselves and with other staff at Uber, speculating that Plaintiff had made up the brutal rape in collusion with a rival of Uber in India to undermine Uber's business.""

Further Reading Woman sues Uber in US over rape by driver in New Delhi The terms of the new settlement were also not made public. Uber did not immediately respond to Ars' Sunday request for comment.

Since the plaintiff's second lawsuit, Uber has been in something of a tumultuous state: Kalanick was ousted as CEO, though he has remained as a board member and has clashed with his fellow members. By November, the new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, revealed that the company had been hit by a major data breach in 2016 and kept it from the public for over a year.

Meanwhile, Uber continues to be dogged by an ongoing high-profile lawsuit, Waymo v. Uber, which could have a major impact on the future of autonomous driving.

That case is set to go to trial in San Francisco in early February 2018.","highprofile lawsuit waymo

Eric Bangeman,One of Audi’s most popular models gets upgrades for the 2018 model year.,2017-12-10T14:30:12+00:00,ars-technica,"A sea of calm behind the wheel: The 2018 Audi Q5, reviewed",https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/12/a-sea-of-calm-behind-the-wheel-the-2018-audi-q5-reviewed/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/q5-front-listing-1-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The Q5 has long been one of Audi’s best-selling models in the US. And what’s not to like? It’s a respectable-looking and functional mid-size crossover, slotting in between the bite-size Q3 and the three-row Audi Q7. With a base MSRP of $42,475, the Q5 competes with stalwarts like the BMW X3, Lexus RX450, and Acura RDX, as well as upstarts like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio (look for our review soon). But the Q5 was getting a bit stale, as it hadn’t seen any substantive changes since its introduction in 2008. With the 2018 model, Audi has updated the Q5, making this a good time to check in with its workhorse.

What’s new in 2018

Further Reading 2018 Audi SQ5: A danger to sports sedans or window dressing over good bones? Gone is the old 2.0-liter, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine, replaced by a... 2.0-liter, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine. This year’s model offers 252hp and 273lb-ft of torque, an improvement on 2017’s 220hp and 258lb-ft of torque. That should get you from zero to 60mph in a smooth 5.8 seconds, a touch faster than last year. The all-wheel drive Q5 comes with a seven-speed, dual-clutch transmission. If you want more in the way of raw performance, there’s an SQ5 version with a turbocharged, 354hp V-6 and an eight-speed transmission for about $12,000 more.

On the outside, the 2018 Q5 is an inch longer, two inches wider, and has a slightly longer wheelbase. The tweaks to the hood, grille, and sideview mirrors make for a more aerodynamic design. In terms of exterior design, the 2018 Q5 is evolutionary rather than revolutionary.

The Q5 interior has seen some upgrades as well, most notably the MMI infotainment system and instrument cluster. Both of those have been given the “retina treatment,” with the instrument cluster now consisting of a cleverly laid-out, smaller HD screen that can supplement or mirror the functions of the main 8.3-inch HD screen which protrudes unobtrusively from the middle of the dashboard. The climate control and drive select buttons are now touch-sensitive as well.

Further Reading A retina display for the road: The clever new 2016 Audi TT reviewed The Q5 I tested was tricked out with Audi’s Prestige package. This includes 20-inch wheels instead of the usual 18-inchers, LED headlights, touch-sensitive MMI interface, adaptive cruise control, a top-view camera system, and more. With all of the included options, this one would retail for $56,100. Audi rates the Q5’s mileage at 25mpg (23 city, 27 highway); I saw just over 27 on the highway and in the 22.5-23.5 range for city driving.

An interior Darth Vader would be proud to drive

Further Reading The state of the car computer: Forget horsepower, we want megahertz! Let’s start with the interior. Trimmed out with the finishes you’d expect in a $50,000 car, the cockpit is now on par with that of the Q7, and it is a very comfortable place to spend time in. I don’t want to wax too much on Audi’s outstanding MMI system; Jonathan Gitlin covered it in his review of the 2016 Audi TT, and Ron Amadeo went into even more depth in his infotainment feature. You should definitely read those articles if you want a more detailed look at it—the MMI is a truly fantastic piece of technology.

Much of the MMI’s excellence comes from its interface. You interact with the main MMI display via a large knob, four buttons, and what looks like a trackpad. Taken together, they make fiddling with the radio, entering an address, or tweaking other settings very simple. You can even write the first letters of an address or city on the touchpad when using GPS navigation.

The 12.3-inch HD display that takes the place of the usual instrument panel is also a pleasure to use. It has a tabbed interface with steering wheel controls that allows the driver to interact with the GPS, change radio stations, make a phone call, and see the usual mileage and fuel economy statistics. The two screens work together for a tightly integrated infotainment experience.

The Q5’s interior is well-trimmed. The front seats are comfortable and come with adjustable lumbar support. There’s plenty of headroom, even with the panoramic moonroof, and two adults can sit comfortably in the adjustable backseats, which have their own climate controls. You can fold down the three seats independently, when needed, for 60+ cubic feet of cargo space. With the seats up, you have an adequate 26.8 cubic feet of space, accessible via the standard power liftgate. That middle seat is going to be bad news for any normal-sized adult, however.

Included in the Prestige trim is a heads-up display. It shows your current speed, the local speed limit, and indicates whether lane-assist is active. If you’re using the GPS, you’ll also see navigation prompts. Should you find the heads-up display too distracting, you can turn it off, but it’s useful for keeping your eyes on the road instead of flitting about the cabin.

Hitting the road

I began driving the Q5 the day after wrapping up a week with the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio, and the contrast between the two vehicles couldn’t be more pronounced. You’ll be able to read—and watch—my take on that SUV next week, but briefly, the times when the Stelvio felt like a performance sedan in the body of a crossover—giving me a strong sense of connection with the road—the Q5 felt like it distanced me from what was going on around me. And that’s not entirely a bad thing.

I spent most of my time behind the Q5 with the drive set on comfort or dynamic (you can also select offroad, allroad, efficiency, or auto). My daily driver is a 2008 Audi TT, which I love in part because of the powerful connection I feel with the road when I’m behind the wheel. In contrast, the Q5 made me feel insulated from the road, but in a good way.

Let’s start with road noise—it’s largely absent when you’re in a Q5, regardless of speed or traffic. The Q5 is so quiet, I suspected Audi of using noise-cancellation to mask driving sounds. Instead, it’s the windows and insulation that make for a quiet ride.

The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine always has enough for whatever is asked of it, although I felt a brief hesitation before the turbo kicked in once or twice. That said, the engine responds when summoned, even if it’s not nearly as quick as that of the Stelvio. On winding country roads, the high driving position was a reminder that I wasn’t in a roadster and that I should lay back a little bit in the curves. But when I did push a little, I felt fairly locked onto the pavement, without any real top-heavy feeling.

Giving the driver a helping hand

Audi has been one of the automakers at the forefront of assisted driving, and the Q5 I tested came loaded with the tech. Adaptive cruise control worked extremely well, keeping pace with the car in front of me even in slow-and-go traffic. You can manually adjust your following distance via the MMI, which is useful.

Lane assist kicks on once you’re in the neighborhood of 35mph. Once the lane indicators in the heads-up display turn green, you’re in business. Like other vehicles, Audi’s system can struggle with faded lane markings, especially on very bright days. But when engaged, it will detect when you’re drifting into another lane and steer back towards the center.

Feeling the steering wheel move under my hand was a little unsettling the first time it happened, and if the Q5 needs to do two or three corrections in a short period of time, it will politely remind you to keep your hands on the wheel. But it works very well, leading to that feeling of disengagement that I occasionally ran into while driving the Audi. Last on the driver-assist list are three yellow lights on the sideview mirrors that flash when a car is in your blind spot.

It’s not just the lack of road or engine noise that makes piloting the Q5 a calming experience. The posh interior, quiet ride, and technological sophistication synchronized to make the days I spent behind the wheel of the Q5 rewarding ones. The Q5 doesn’t offer an exhilarating ride—the Stelvio is as close as I’ve come to that feeling behind the wheel of a crossover—but it’s an immensely satisfying ride.

The crossover market is crowded, and if you’ve got $45,000 to $60,000 to spend, picking which crossover is right for you is going to be tough. Where Audi sets itself apart from the competition is the instrument panel and infotainment system. The only other manufacturer that comes close is Volvo, and both Audi and Volvo stand head and shoulders above the crowd. In some ways, that was the hardest thing about watching the Q5 drive away from my house—knowing that I was returning to a world of fiddly infotainment systems.

Audi’s cockpit ergonomics are also fantastic. Everything is within easy reach, and the learning curve is a shallow one. You’re not going to need to spend hours leafing through the owner’s manual to figure out how everything works. Five to 10 minutes in your garage messing around and you’ll be the master of your crossover domain.

If you value technological sophistication, smart design, and plush ride above all else, then the Q5 is the car for you. While you may not feel as connected to the pavement as you would in something sportier, like a Stelvio, you’re going to feel like the king of the road, moving in a serene and stately fashion from point A to point B. And that’s not a bad way to go.","marlowe bangeman marlowe bangeman marlowe bangeman marlowe bangeman marlowe bangeman marlowe bangeman marlowe bangeman

Dan Goodin,Not clear if issue with highly-rated safe can be patched.,2017-12-09T22:20:32+00:00,ars-technica,Top-selling handgun safe can be remotely opened in seconds—no PIN needed,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/top-selling-handgun-safe-can-be-remotely-opened-in-seconds-no-pin-needed/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/vaultek-vt20i-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"One of Amazon's top-selling electronic gun safes contains a critical vulnerability that allows it to be opened by virtually anyone, even when they don't know the password.

The Vaultek VT20i handgun safe, ranked fourth in Amazon's gun safes and cabinets category, allows owners to electronically open the door using a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone app. The remote unlock feature is supposed to work only when someone knows the four- to eight-digit personal identification number used to lock the device. But it turns out that this PIN safeguard can be bypassed using a standard computer and a small amount of programming know-how.

As the video demonstration below shows, researchers with security firm Two Six Labs were able to open a VT20i safe in a matter of seconds by using their MacBook Pro to send specially designed Bluetooth data while it was in range. The feat required no knowledge of the unlock PIN or any advanced scanning of the vulnerable safe. The hack works reliably even when the PIN is changed. All that's required to make it work is that the safe have Bluetooth connectivity turned on.

Vaultek holds out the VT20i as a reliable way to keep guns and other valuables safely secured and out of the wrong hands. With more than 250 customer reviews on Amazon, it boasts an overall rating of 4.5 stars out of a possible five stars. Marketers also say the safe is compliant with Transportation Security Administration rules required for people to fly with guns carried in checked luggage.

In an e-mail, Vaultek officials said the attack demonstrated in the video would be hard to execute.

""What you are not seeing is the prep time required to isolate the correct code and the time required to study the safe and it's transmissions, and the subsequent decoding time needed to generate the final code,"" company officials wrote. ""This can take hours of work and also requires the ability to observe a correctly paired phone.""

Not so fast

Two Six Labs researchers, however, disputed the claim and said the Vaultek statement fundamentally mischaracterizes their exploit.

""Once you have developed this capability or written a script to do it, you can affect any safe in this product line in a matter of seconds,"" Austin Fletcher, Two Sixes Labs' lead vulnerability research engineer, told Ars. ""Anyone can do this.""

In a blog post disclosing the vulnerability, the researchers included most of the code required to exploit the vulnerability. A competent developer would need 20 to 60 minutes to supply the missing portion. With that, the developer could build a smartphone app that could silently break into any existing VT20i safe in seconds, as long as Bluetooth was turned on.

Vaultek officials said they are in the process of introducing changes to their safes after receiving a private report two months ago about Two Six Labs' findings. ""Vaultek takes personal security very seriously and we constantly monitor our products and will make every effort to continually improve,"" Vaultek officials wrote.

Daniel Su, Two Six Labs' research engineer, told Ars he doesn't believe the bug can be fixed in existing safes. That assessment, he said, is based on the fact that the flaw resides in the firmware that runs on the safe. ""We have not seen any evidence of there being a firmware update mechanism,"" he said. E-mails from Vaultek left Ars' questions about the lack of an update mechanism unanswered.

Two Six Labs also reported two other vulnerabilities in the popular safe. One, stemming from a lack of encryption in the Bluetooth communications, allows attackers within range to obtain the unlock PIN.

A second weakness allows anyone to make an unlimited number of attempts to pair a Bluetooth device with the safe. The safe design allows PINs that are four to eight digits long, but it only accepts digits 1 through 5. That means there are a maximum of 390,625 combinations (that is, 58). The number of combinations will be considerably smaller number if owners use a PIN shorter than eight digits.

The vulnerability means that anyone who relies on a VT20i safe to secure valuables should immediately turn off Bluetooth connectivity and leave it off indefinitely. Safes can still be locked and unlocked using a traditional physical key, as well as by owners' fingerprints. Some Amazon customers, however, have complained the fingerprint feature is flawed as well.","bluetoothenabled

Jon Brodkin,"“We want to groom a Verizon puppet to install as FCC chair,” Verizon says in skit.",2017-12-09T19:53:03+00:00,ars-technica,Ajit Pai jokes with Verizon exec about him being a “puppet” FCC chair,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/ajit-pai-jokes-about-being-a-brainwashed-verizon-puppet-at-the-fcc/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ajit-pai-fox-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"On Thursday night in Washington, DC, net neutrality advocates gathered outside the annual Federal Communications Commission Chairman's Dinner to protest Chairman Ajit Pai's impending rollback of net neutrality rules.

Inside the dinner (also known as the ""telecom prom"") at the Washington Hilton, Pai entertained the audience with jokes about him being a puppet installed by Verizon to lead the FCC. Further Reading “Face reality! We need net neutrality!” Crowds chant across the country

Pai was a Verizon associate general counsel from 2001 to 2003, and next week he will lead an FCC vote to eliminate net neutrality rules—just as Verizon and other ISPs have asked him to.

At the dinner, Pai played a satirical video that showed him planning his ascension to the FCC chairmanship with a Verizon executive in 2003. The Verizon executive was apparently Kathleen Grillo, a senior VP and deputy general counsel in the company's public policy and government affairs division.

The speech was apparently not supposed to be public, but Gizmodo obtained footage of Pai's remarks and the skit. You can watch it here.

Brainwashing a Verizon puppet

Pai introduced the Verizon skit with these remarks:

In collusion, I mean conclusion... sorry, Freudian slip, my bad. Many people are still shell-shocked that I'm up here tonight [as chairman]. They ask themselves, ""How on Earth did this happen?"" Well, moments before tonight's dinner, somebody leaked a 14-year-old video that helps answer that question, and in all candor I can no longer hide from the truth.

The video then rolled. Here's a transcript:

Verizon executive: ""As you know, the FCC is captured by industry. But we think it's not captured enough. We want to brainwash and groom a Verizon puppet to install as FCC chairman. Think Manchurian Candidate."" Ajit Pai: ""That sounds awesome."" Verizon executive: ""I know, right? There are only two problems. First, this is going to take 14 years to incubate. We need to find someone smart, young, ambitious, but dorky enough to throw the scent off."" Ajit Pai: ""Hello."" Verizon executive: ""So you will do it?"" Ajit Pai: ""Absolutely. But you said there was another issue?"" Verizon executive: We need to find a Republican who can win the presidency in 2016 to appoint you FCC chairman. I think our best bet is an outsider, but I have no idea who that would be. If only somebody can give us a sign.

At that point in the video, a picture of Donald Trump appeared.

""And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I became chairman of the FCC,"" Pai told the audience, to laughs and applause.

The annual dinner is hosted by the Federal Communications Bar Association, a group of telecom attorneys and other communications industry professionals.

“Can’t wait for those fast lanes”

Pai also joked about the FCC re-locating to Trump Tower and the paid fast lanes that ISPs will be able to sell to online services after the net neutrality repeal. Noting that he recently toured parts of America in rental cars, Pai said, ""can't wait for those fast lanes.""

Pai also poked fun at Democrats' claims that he has shown favoritism toward Sinclair, a broadcast station owner that is trying to buy the Tribune Media Company.

""People ask me, 'what keeps you up at night?' and it's actually pretty easy: the thought of the FCC having to resolve a retransmission dispute between Verizon and Sinclair,"" Pai said. ""I mean, how do you choose between a longtime love and your newfound crush?""

Footage of Pai's speech leaking to the press is perhaps not surprising given one of the remarks he made. Saying he wanted to provide advice to the FCC's Democratic minority, Pai said his first tip is to ""Leak frequently. You can't set the commission's agenda, but you can set Comm Daily's.""

Pai also spoke about his plans to eliminate net neutrality rules at an event at Verizon's DC office on Tuesday, referring to the rules as ""so-called 'net neutrality.'” The FCC's net neutrality repeal vote is scheduled for December 14.

Beth Mole,New data suggests a particularly nasty flu type and a crummy vaccine this year.,2017-12-09T18:20:02+00:00,ars-technica,Looks like a rough flu season ahead. Here are answers to ALL your flu questions,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/this-years-flu-season-is-upon-us-and-it-looks-bad-heres-what-you-should-know/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-837481992-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The 2017-2018 flu season is off to an early start, potentially hitting highs during the end-of-year holidays. Data so far suggests it could be a doozy. The predominant virus currently circulating tends to cause more cases of severe disease and death than other seasonal varieties. And the batch of vaccines for this year have some notable weaknesses.

To help you prepare—or just help you brush up on your flu facts—here are answers to every critical flu question you might ever have (well, hopefully). We’ll start off with the basics...

Table of Contents

What is the flu?

The flu, or influenza, is a contagious respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus (not to be confused with Haemophilus influenzae, an opportunistic bacterium that can cause secondary infections following sicknesses, such as the flu). Symptoms of the flu include chills, fever, headache, malaise, running nose, sore throat, coughing, tiredness, and muscle aches.

A little history: the flu virus gets its name from an Italian folk word that attributed colds, coughs, and fevers to the influence of the stars or astrological events. The term later evolved into to influenza di freddo, or “influence of the cold.”

Why does flu strike in the winter each year, anyway?

Though flu viruses circulate all year long, they do spike in the cold of winter. And it’s still not completely understood why. That said, researchers hypothesize that this spike is due to both changes in human behaviors and some biology. As the temperature outside drops, people tend to spend more time indoors with windows closed. There, they may be more likely to breathe in germy air and encounter sick people. Also, experiments in guinea pigs have shown that airborne flu viruses get around best when conditions are cold and dry—aka wintery.

This is just the seasonal flu we’re talking about. It’s not that big of a deal, right?

It is, actually. Seasonal flu epidemics cause three to five million cases of severe disease each year worldwide, leaving 300,000 to 500,000 dead, according to the World Health Organization. In the US, flu forces 140,000 to 710,000 people into hospitals and causes 12,000 to 56,000 deaths annually. The hardest hit are children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.

In general, how long is a person sick and contagious?

Flu virus sickens and kills by getting into our airways and storming cells in the lining of our respiratory tracts. The virus forces its way into cells, usurps cellular machinery to make copies of itself, and the resulting clone army explodes out of the cell to march forth to the next cellular victims.

After quietly running amok for one to four days (the incubation period), symptoms begin. In healthy adults, it usually takes three to seven days to shake the infection. But, people can be infectious from a day prior to showing symptoms to five to seven days after symptoms clear.

Some flu viruses are worse than others, right? So, what are the different types of flu virus and what’s up with all those numbers and letters?

Flu viruses are in the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses, which uses RNA as its genetic code (as opposed to DNA). The family includes four types of influenza that differ by the structural proteins that form their viral particles and support their RNA. The types are simply dubbed: A, B, C, and D.

Influenza A and B are the big ones; both cause seasonal epidemics. Type A viruses are particularly dangerous because they can infect humans, several other mammals, and birds—and jump between them. They easily morph and shift into new genetic forms, making them incredibly difficult to defeat. Type A viruses are responsible for flu pandemics. Influenza B viruses, on the other hand, only infect humans and seals. With their relative lack of host-hopping, type Bs shows less genetic transformations and have not been linked to pandemics.

Influenza C viruses infect humans, dogs, and pigs, and they have caused local outbreaks. But C viruses are currently not on a seasonal rotation. Influenza D viruses are relatively new to the family, first identified in the US in 2014. They infect cattle and pigs, but have not been seen in people.

With their genetic shifting and switching, Type A flu viruses are further broken down by the types of antigens they carry—those are molecular components that can trigger our immune systems to recognize an invader and mount a defense. These antigens are hemagglutinin (Ha or H) and Neuraminidase (NA or N). These are the basis for virus names like H1N1 and H3N2. There are 18 subtypes of Hs and 11 subtypes of Ns, creating the possibility of 198 different combinations.

But wait, there’s more. Variations exist within each type of virus and even within each subtype of H and N, creating even more types of flu.

To keep it all straight, the WHO came up with a system in 1979 to officially name each flu virus. Here’s how the rules say to list the name:

type of virus (A, B, C);

the animal origin (pig, bird, etc., but no designation for human);

the location where it was isolated (e.g., Iowa);

the strain number;

the year of isolation; and

if it’s a type A virus, the H and N numbers.

So official flu designations end up looking like this: “A/duck/Alberta/35/76 (H1N1)” and “B/Brisbane/60/2008.”

I hear about the Hs and Ns the most. Why are they so important?

Yes!!! I’m so glad you asked. Let’s talk about viral invasion!

Both H and N are so important because they are critical for infection—and how we defeat the virus.

Both proteins are stuck onto the outside of the viral particles, forming little spikes that are visible under electron microscopes. Generally, H is responsible for getting the viral particle into a host cell where it can run amok. N is responsible for getting viruses out to go forth and invade more cells.

H works by grabbing onto a common sugar component of proteins that hang on cell surfaces, called sialic acid. Once attached, the viral particle gets essentially engulfed by the cell, a process called endocytosis. The cell creates a little membrane-bound bubble around the virus and then sucks it into the cell with the intention of destroying it.

Inside the now intra-cellular bubble, the pH is lower than outside of the cell. This environment triggers H to go through conformational shifts, creating longer projections that can pierce the bubble’s membrane. In other words, Hs coating the outside of the surrounded virus act like spring-loaded spikes that burst out, piercing and fusing to the membrane. This allows the virus to take over. (Pretty badass, right?)

From there, the virus can unload its contents into the cell, replicate its RNA using the cell’s replication machinery, and then start mass producing virus. When it’s time to move on, the viruses N can cleave the sialic acids on the host cell’s membrane, basically allowing the newly formed viruses to bud out.

Thus H and N are crucial to the viral invasions—but they can also be the source of their downfall. Because H and N prominently stick out from the surface of the virus, they provide a molecular signature that the immune system can use to spot the viruses—remember, I mentioned they were antigens. The immune system generates antibodies—little Y-shaped proteins—that recognize and block H and N and ignite responses that isolate and destroy the virus. That said, the antibodies that stick onto the tops of Hs are the most effective at defeating the viruses.

To get around these effective immune responses and move around to new hosts, type A viruses can morph their Hs and Ns easily. They can be dramatic changes, like swapping or making major changes to Hs, resulting in a virus changing from H0N1 to H1N1, for instance. Such big changes can create brand-new dangerous combinations and even spark pandemics. Or, there can be smaller genetic tweaks that create variation within an H subtype that can trip up immune responses and thwart vaccines.

Cut to the chase: What’s up with this year’s flu season?

According to the latest data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Thursday (December 7), the flu season is off to an early start. Flu cases tend to crest between December and February. This year, weekly surveillance suggests it may peak at the end of December. Reports of flu have picked up recently and are expected to continue to increase in the coming weeks.

The predominant viruses circulating are type A H3N2 viruses. H3 flu seasons tend to be nastier than others. To a lesser extent, surveillance has picked up another type A, H1N1, and a type B in the Yamagata lineage (lineages are used for type B viruses, instead of the Hs and Ns). This largely matches what experts predicted for this flu season.","the

Jonathan M. Gitlin,"Clarkson, May, and Hammond go to Switzerland in some supercars.",2017-12-09T18:00:16+00:00,ars-technica,The Grand Tour season 2: the one where Hammond nearly dies... again,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/12/the-grand-tour-season-2-the-one-where-hammond-nearly-dies-again/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/The-Grand-Tour-Switzerland-760x380.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Warning: this post contains some spoilers about the first episode of the new season of The Grand Tour.

Some say it's the greatest car show... in the world. Others say it started well but had a very patchy first season. All I know is that The Grand Tour came back to Amazon Prime on Friday for a second season.

If you loved the first season of The Grand Tour, you'll have a fine old time with season 2. The idea behind the show is to keep all the bits that you loved about Top Gear but without pissing off the BBC's lawyers. And based on the season preview clips we saw during the intro to the first episode of season 2, there should be plenty of that in store—particularly the episode that features a Bugatti EB110 and a Jaguar XJ220. But if you find Jeremy Clarkson's antics boorish, be warned; on that front, season 2 is very much more of the same.

As possibly the most-pirated TV show ever, you probably don't need me to explain the concept behind The Grand Tour to you. But just in case, it involves Top Gear alumni Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond driving cars in different places around the world, funded via Amazon's deep pockets after Clarkson's behavior finally proved unacceptable to the BBC.

Happily, Clarkson et al. have been listening to feedback in their down time. Some of the clunkier elements of season one have been cut. Mike Skinner—the American ""he's not a Stig, honest"" race car driver—has been canned, along with that odd test track that wrapped around an electricity substation.

And the celebrity deaths segment is gone, too, but special guests still make an appearance, competing against each other in a Jaguar F-Type on a new part-paved, part-dirt course. This week we got Baywatch's David Hasselhoff and someone called Ricky Wilson (no, I don't know who that is either). I could have done without this bit entirely, for it drags on and on.









The season-opening trip involves our three heroes driving in the past, present, and future of the supercar. The setting is Switzerland; perfect for stunning aerial shots of sinuous mountain passes and exhausts spitting fire in long tunnels.

Clarkson, as you'd expect, picks the past—in this case, a Lamborghini Aventador, 12 cylinders of naturally aspirated noise and power covered in bright yellow paint. May, representing the present, has the Acura NSX. It's a hybrid, with an electric motor for each of the front wheels, plus another that works with the twin-turbo V6 at the rear. May even points out how clever its A-pillars are, something he might have picked up on here at Ars.

And then there's Hammond. As a harbinger of the future, he is equipped with the Rimac Concept One. It's a hand-built electric hypercar from the same company that supplies EV engineering know-how to companies like Koenigsegg, as well as ""Monster"" Tajima's Pikes Peak race car. Hammond's need to be within range of a DC fast charger places certain geographical restrictions on our intrepid adventurers, including the requirement that our meat-and-booze hounds have to spend several days staying at a (dry) health spa.

For the most part, their adventures are all quite funny, and the scenes with the cars in action look and sounds like everything you'd want them to be. It's not really a spoiler to say that everything ends in disaster since footage of the incident has been on YouTube since June, but it all ends in tears for the EV. Which makes me wonder why people keep letting Hammond drive fast cars, because he keeps destroying them and ending up in hospital.

I'll be honest, I spent most of the episode swearing at Hammond through the TV, knowing what was ahead. And I do find Clarkson's current character iteration to be a tired parody of his older, funnier self. But the majority of the show was entertaining enough to remind me why Amazon cut them such a fat cheque in the first place.","alumni clarkson james

Or, translated into the online world: if a guy in Romania claiming to be an American service member overseas wants to sell you a Mercedes at a really good price and all you have to do is send some money to an escrow account, he’s probably scamming you.

On Friday, a Romanian man was sentenced by a federal judge in Tennessee to two years and five months in prison for participating in a scheme to defraud Americans out of over $870,000 in goods that never existed.

Vlad Diaconu, 37, of Bucharest, Romania, pleaded guilty to fraud back in March 2017, admitting that he had listed nonexistent cars on eBay and other websites. He and his cohorts would entice dozens of victims to put up money in what they believed was an escrow account when, in fact, it was an account held by criminals. Diaconu would then transfer the money to European bank accounts.

In an earlier court filing, Diaconu’s lawyer had asked that his client only receive 25 months (two years and one month) in prison, saying that his client had already suffered enough. After being arrested, Diaconu was detained in a Romanian jail cell for over three months where, once a day, he was only served “something of porridge” poured from a jug.

Back in 2013, American authorities also indicted other Romanians on similar charges.","bucharest romania

Crews with help from a fleet water-dropping planes and helicopters saved homes as unpredictable gusts sent the blaze deeper into residential foothill areas northwest of Los Angeles that haven't burned in decades. New evacuations were ordered as the fire sent up an enormous plume near Montecito and Carpinteria, seaside areas in Santa Barbara County that had been under fire threat for days and were now choked with smoke.

""The winds are kind of squirrely right now,"" said county fire spokesman Mike Eliason. ""Some places the smoke is going straight up in the air, and others it's blowing sideways. Depends on what canyon we're in.""

The department posted a photo of one residence engulfed in flames. It's unclear whether other structures burned. Thousands of homes and businesses in the county were without power.

The air thick with acrid smoke, even residents of areas not under evacuation orders took the opportunity to leave, fearing another shutdown of U.S. 101, a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week. Officials handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in Montecito, the wealthy hillside enclave that's home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Rob Lowe.

""Our house is under threat of being burned,"" Ellen DeGeneres tweeted at midday Sunday. ""We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters.""

A few miles to the west, Santa Barbara Zoo was closed to the public and its 500 animals confined to their night quarters all day. The zoo was just outside the evacuation area, but smoke and ash blew through the 30-acre property.

Firefighters made significant progress Saturday on other fronts of the enormous fire that started Dec. 4 in neighboring Ventura County. As containment increased on other major blazes in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego counties, resources from those fires were diverted to the Santa Barbara foothills.

Forecasters said Santa Ana winds that whipped fires across the region last week would continue in some areas at least through Monday.

A lack of rain has officials on edge statewide because of parched conditions and no end in sight to the typical fire season.

""This is the new normal,"" Gov. Jerry Brown warned Saturday after surveying damage from the deadly Ventura fire. ""We're about ready to have firefighting at Christmas. This is very odd and unusual.""

High fire risk is expected to last into January and the governor and experts said climate change is making it a year-round threat.

Overall, the fires have destroyed about 800 homes and other buildings, killed dozens of horses and forced more than 200,000 people to flee flames that have burned over 270 square miles (700 square kilometers) since Dec. 4. One death, so far, a 70-year-old woman who crashed her car on an evacuation route, is attributed to the fire in Santa Paula, a small city where the fire began.

The Ventura County blaze also continued to burn into rugged mountains in the Los Padres National Forest near the little town of Ojai and toward a preserve established for endangered California condors.

Ojai experienced hazardous levels of smoke at times and officials warned of unhealthy air for large swaths of the region. The South Coast Air Quality Management District urged residents to stay indoors if possible and avoid vigorous outdoor activities.

As fires burned in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, firefighters were already in place north of San Diego on Thursday when a major fire erupted and rapidly spread in the Fallbrook area, known for its avocado groves and horse stables in the rolling hills.

The fire swept through the San Luis Rey Training Facility, where it killed more than 40 elite thoroughbreds and destroyed more than 100 homes — most of them in a retirement community. Three people were burned trying to escape the fire that continued to smolder Sunday.

Most of last week's fires were in places that burned in the past, including one in the ritzy Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air that burned six homes and another in the city's rugged foothills above the community of Sylmar and in Santa Paula.

KIM CHANDLER,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore has been a rare sight on the traditional campaign trail in the days ahead of a critical U.S. Senate race.

(AP) — Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore has been a rare sight on the traditional campaign trail in the days ahead of a critical U.S. Senate race. He's appeared at only a handful of rallies in front of friendly audiences and steadfastly has shunned reporters from the mainstream media.

Moore's past campaigns have never been heavy on the conventional, but his relative absence from the spotlight this time around is nearly unheard of for a major party candidate.

Moore has focused on meeting with small groups of supporters and an aggressive social media campaign out of camera range as he tries to win Tuesday's election against Democrat Doug Jones - a contest that was supposed to be an easy GOP victory - until November, when a number of women stepped forward to accuse Moore of engaging in sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers.

Moore has denied the allegations and refuses to back down.

Moore's stealth effort has left Jones resorting to mockery as the Democrat crisscrosses the state trying to pull an upset in Tuesday's special election, buoyed by the possibility that enough Republicans will abandon the 70-year-old Moore in the wake of the allegations.

""Roy Moore is in hiding. He's kind of like the groundhog. He comes out every so often to see if he can see his shadow,"" Jones said Saturday in Selma during one of several stops for the Democrat this weekend.

Ben DuPre, a campaign spokesman, said Moore is not holding back.

""He's talking to voters. We are getting the message out any way that we can. I know you are the old media and you get offended when we don't talk to you, but we've got Twitter. We've got Facebook. He's doing interviews. He's doing radio.""

Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said Moore has spent the week doing smaller unannounced event with supporters and has been on the phone with pastors and others urging supporters to get to the pools on Tuesday. He said the campaign feels confident going into Tuesday.

Moore's campaign is actively pushing his narrative on social media and in press releases. He's also drawing headlines with the help of President Donald Trump, who came to the Florida Panhandle on Friday night and has lined up a recorded telephone call from the president that will start being delivered to Alabama voters on Monday.

Moore has never been conventional. He has built a large following among some evangelical voters from two failed gambits: upholding a display of the Ten Commandments in a state building and trying to block same-sex marriage in Alabama. He was tossed from office in both instances.

Moore plans to close out his campaign Monday night with another large rally featuring former Trump campaign guru Stephen Bannon.

Alabama campaign consultant David Mowery - whose client Democrat Bob Vance lost to Moore in the 2012 Alabama Supreme Court chief justice race - said Moore has never been a candidate to do many public events but shunning just about all traditional media during the Senate race is ""pretty unprecedented.""

Still, Mowery said, Moore knows how to focus on his base.

""We never knew where he was and then we'd get a picture from somebody showing us some church marquee saying, 'Judge Moore is here on Saturday,'"" he recalled. ""He's out there, he's just with his base, and usually in small events.""

Mowery said the temptation is to obsess too much over what Moore is doing.

""You lose the forest for the trees worrying over the opponent,"" Mowery said. ""It wasn't like we were competing over the same voters anyway.""

""We were going after the Chamber of Commerce, country club, First Methodist kind of Republicans ... not the fundamentalists and the snake handlers. We were never going to get them anyway, and neither is Doug,"" he said.

Bill Stewart, the former chairman of the political science department at the University of Alabama, said Moore appears to be banking on his evangelical base, as well as the state's overwhelming tendency to vote Republican, to carry him to victory on Tuesday.

Republicans in Alabama tend to clear 60 percent of the vote — though Moore has struggled in his previous races to reach that number — and voters here haven't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992.

Stewart said he can't remember a candidate ever virtually ""disappearing from public view"" the way Moore has. Still, he said Moore has little to gain but ""a lot to lose"" by making a mistake.

""There may be a method in his madness,"" Stewart said.","political science department

JOSEF FEDERMAN and TIA GOLDENBERG,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The French and Israeli leaders sparred verbally Sunday over the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, while new violence rippled across the region following the move by U.S. President Donald Trump. In Jerusalem, a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard, seriously wounding him in the first attack in the volatile city since Trump's pronouncement Wednesday.

In Jerusalem, a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard, seriously wounding him in the first attack in the volatile city since Trump's pronouncement Wednesday. In Beirut, scores of Lebanese and Palestinian demonstrators clashed with security forces outside the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy, and Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo demanded that the United States rescind the decision.

The move upended decades of U.S. policy, and a longstanding international consensus, that the fate of Jerusalem be decided in negotiations. Israeli and Palestinian claims to the city's eastern sector form the emotional core of their conflict, and Trump's announcement was seen as siding with the Israelis and has drawn wide international criticism.

At a meeting in Paris with Israel's visiting prime minister, French President Emmanuel Macron condemned recent violence against Israelis. But he also expressed ""disapproval"" of Trump's decision, calling it ""dangerous for peace.""

""It doesn't seem to serve, in the short term, the cause of Israel's security and the Israelis themselves,"" Macron said.

He urged Israel to freeze its construction of settlements on occupied lands and called for other confidence-building measures toward the Palestinians.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has called Trump's decision ""historic,"" said Israel has maintained its capital in the city for 70 years and the Jewish connection to Jerusalem goes back 3,000 years.

""Paris is the capital of France, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,"" he said. ""We respect your history and your choices. And we know that as friends, you respect ours.""

""I think the sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality, the sooner we move toward peace,"" he added.

The exchange between the two allies set the stage for what could be a tense meeting Monday for Netanyahu with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels. The Jerusalem issue and the moribund peace process are expected to be high on the agenda.

Last week, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini warned that Trump's decision ""has the potential to send us backward to even darker times than the one we are already living in.""

She also warned that Trump's ""move could diminish the potential role that the United States could play in the region and create more confusion around this.""

The meeting could be a precursor for what seems to be an emerging rift between Israel and the U.S. on one side, and Europe and the Palestinians on the other.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Trump's decision has in effect disqualified the U.S. from continuing in its role as the traditional mediator of peace talks. The Palestinians have spent recent days trying to rally Arab and broader international opposition to the decision.

After Abbas political adviser Majdi Khaldi said Saturday that the Palestinian leader won't meet with Vice President Mike Pence when he visits the region this month, a spokeswoman for Pence said Sunday it was ""unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region.""

EU leaders, including Macron, have reiterated support for establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Trump has said he would support the idea if both sides endorse it — effectively giving Israel a veto over any peace proposal. Netanyahu's government is dominated by opponents to Palestinian independence. Trump's Middle East team, headed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been working for months on a peace plan but has not yet released it.

Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed the area to its capital in a move that was not internationally recognized. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

East Jerusalem is home to Judaism's most sacred site, as well as key holy places for Christians and Muslims. These conflicting claims have erupted into deadly bloodshed in the past.

A senior U.S. official appealed to world leaders, especially in the Middle East, to calm regional tensions.

Acting Assistant Secretary of State David Satterfield told Arab journalists that Trump's pronouncement was merely a ""recognition of simple reality"" that Israel's government already is in Jerusalem.

He said the U.S. was not prejudging final-status negotiations about the city's final borders and expressed hope that world leaders understand the U.S. is committed to moving forward with a peace plan he expects to be unveiled in the new year.

""This is a question of choice: Do leaders choose to speak to their peoples, to their regions in terms that reflect reality or in terms that incite or inflame?"" he said. ""We hope it's the former.""

The Palestinians staged three ""days of rage"" after Trump's dramatic announcement, with clashes breaking out in flashpoints across the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, and Gaza militants firing rockets into Israel. Four people in Gaza were killed. In the West Bank, there were dozens of injuries, but no deaths.

There were indications that Sunday's stabbing at the Jerusalem bus station was motivated by Trump's move, although police did not officially confirm it.

They said the attacker was a 24-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli media identified him as Yassin Abu al-Qarah, who posted on his Facebook page in recent days about Jerusalem, saying ""our blood is devoted"" to the holy city. Comments on his profile called him a hero for the alleged attack.

Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the guard sustained a serious wound to his upper body and the attacker was apprehended.

Palestinian youths also clashed in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, who fired back with rubber bullets and tear gas.

In Beirut, Lebanese security forces broke up the protest outside the U.S. Embassy after demonstrators pelted them with stones. After a rowdy start, the protest drew several hundred people and became more peaceful, with demonstrators chanting and singing.

Clashes resumed in the afternoon, with security forces chasing and arresting a handful of protesters and lobbing tear gas. Lebanon is home to 450,000 Palestinian refugees, nearly 10 percent of the population.

In a resolution long on rhetoric but short on concrete actions, Arab foreign ministers demanded the recognition decision be rescinded and urged the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning Trump's decision. They acknowledged that Washington would most likely veto it.

If the U.S. vetoes such a resolution, the Arabs would seek a similar resolution in the U.N. General Assembly, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Malki told a news conference in Cairo.

With few options for the Palestinians, and the Arab world preoccupied by other crises, Arab willingness to press the issue may be limited. In Paris, Netanyahu talked about his quiet but improving relations with Arab countries that look to Israel as an ally against Iran.

""There is in this a blessing, because this could help pave the way to an ultimate peace between us and our Palestinian neighbors and between us and the rest of the Arab world,"" he said.

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., defended Trump's move.

""For those who want to say this is a bad idea, I'll tell you: Ask us five or 10 years from now if you still think it's a bad idea. Because I really do think this is going to move the ball in the peace process,"" she told CNN's ""State of the Union.""","gaza strip east jerusalem

"STEVE PEOPLES, KIM CHANDLER and BILL BARROW","BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Alabama's race for U.S. Senate settled into church for worship on Sunday, with the minister at a historic black congregation calling the race a life-or-death matter for equal rights, conservatives standing by Republican Roy Moore and others feeling unsettled in the middle.

(AP) — Alabama's race for U.S. Senate settled into church for worship on Sunday, with the minister at a historic black congregation calling the race a life-or-death matter for equal rights, conservatives standing by Republican Roy Moore and others feeling unsettled in the middle.

Speaking at Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, where four black girls died in a Ku Klux Klan bombing in 1963, the Rev. Arthur Price evoked the civil rights era between hymns. Democratic nominee Doug Jones prosecuted the last two Klansmen convicted in the attack and has attended events at the church, a downtown landmark with twin domed towers.

""There's too much at stake for us to stay home,"" Price said of Tuesday's election. He didn't endorse Jones from the pulpit but in a later interview called the candidate ""a hero"" to the congregation and Birmingham.

Despite allegations of sexual misconduct involving teen girls decades ago, Moore isn't being abandoned by worshippers at Montgomery's Perry Hill Road Baptist Church, where Moore spoke at a ""God and Country"" rally in September before the accusations arose.

Leaving the red-brick building after a service that ended with a hymn and an altar call, Kevin Mims said he didn't believe the claims against Moore. But even if true, he said, they occurred long ago, and Moore is a conservative who stands ""on the word of God.""

""Everyone has to vote their convictions,"" said Mims, holding a Bible. ""My conviction is he's the right man for the job.""

Lines aren't so clearly defined elsewhere.

Interviews with a dozen parishioners at Mobile's Ashland Place United Methodist Church, the home church of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, turned up neither any Moore defenders nor confirmed votes for Jones. The prevailing mood seemed to be one of frustration over having to choose between a Republican with Moore's baggage and any Democrat.

""I will vote for Judge Moore,"" said Bill Prine, of Mobile. ""I'm not a fan of his, but I'll have to stick with the Republicans.""

The candidates also spent time in church. Accompanied by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala), and others, Jones tweeted a photo from More Than Conquerors Faith Church, a large black congregation in Birmingham. Aides to Moore, who has been almost invisible on the campaign trail during the closing days of the race, didn't disclose his whereabouts Sunday.

After church, Jones told supporters in a cramped campaign office that the results of Tuesday's vote would send a message far beyond Alabama's borders.

""This is an election to tell the whole world what we stand for,"" he said, adding: ""This campaign, ladies and gentlemen, is on the right side of history.""

President Donald Trump weighed in on the race with a phone message that state voters will receive beginning Monday urging them to vote for Moore.

""I'm going to make America safer and stronger and better than ever before. But we need that seat; we need Roy voting for us,"" Trump said in audio of the call provided by the Moore campaign.

Polls show the race too close to call. While Moore had a clear path to victory in a state where no Democrat holds statewide office, the 70-year-old has been fighting for his political life since reports surfaced a month ago that he made sexual advances on teen girls when he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s.

Speaking on CNN on Sunday, GOP Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said allegations that Moore molested a 14-year-old were the ""tipping point"" in his decision to cast a write-in ballot for a ""distinguished Republican"" rather than to vote for Moore or Jones.

""There's a lot of smoke,"" Shelby said. ""Got to be some fire somewhere.""

Roy Moore's chief strategist, Dean Young, tried to tie Moore to the star of President Donald Trump, who remains popular among state Republicans despite low national approval ratings.

""If the people of Alabama vote for this liberal Democrat Doug Jones, they're voting against the president, who they put in office at the highest level,"" Young said on ABC News' ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos.""

In a state considered part of the Bible Belt, the allegations transformed a race into an unexpected referendum on which is better: a man accused of child molestation claims he vehemently denies or a Democrat?

For many conservative Republicans, there's really no choice.

""To me, there's only one person in the race, and that's Judge Moore,"" said David Smith, leaving Perry Hill Baptist with his wife, Cecilia. The two have a recording of Moore's speech earlier this year at their church and sometimes listen to it in the car for inspiration.

At 16th Street Baptist, Merion Turner recalled participating in civil rights marches and was in high school at the time of the bombing. Turner said she would vote for the Democrat on Tuesday, though her choice has little to do with the allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore.

""I just don't like all the division in this country right now,"" she said. ""I think Doug Jones would help that.""

DAVID KEYTON and JIM HEINTZ,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — An American researcher who shared this year's Nobel Prize for medicine bluntly criticized political developments at home in his address at the awards' gala banquet Sunday night.

Michael Rosbash, who was honored for his work on circadian rhythms — commonly called the body clock — expressed concern that U.S. government support such as that received by him and colleagues Jeffrey Hall and Michael Young is endangered.

""We benefited from an enlightened period in the postwar United States. Our National Institutes of Health have enthusiastically and generously supported basic research ... (but) the current climate in the U.S. is a warning that continued support cannot be taken for granted,"" he said in a short speech at the ornate city hall in Stockholm.

The 2018 federal budget proposed by President Donald Trump calls for cutting science funding by billions of dollars

""Also in danger is the pluralistic America into which all three of us of born were born and raised after World War II,"" Rosbash said. ""Immigrants and foreigners have always been an indispensable part of our country, including its great record in scientific research.""

Literature laureate Kazuo Ishiguro of Britain expressed concern about increasing tensions between social factions.

""We live today in a time of growing tribal enmities of communities fracturing into bitterly opposed groups,"" said Ishiguro, who was born in Japan.

He said Nobel prizes can counterbalance such animosity.

""The pride we feel when someone from our nation wins a Nobel prize is different from the one we feel witnessing one of our athletes winning an Olympic medal. We don't feel the pride of our tribe demonstrating superiority over other tribes. Rather it's the pride that from knowing that one of us has made a significant contribution to our common human endeavor,"" he said.

In the Norwegian capital of Oslo, a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima compared her struggle to survive in 1945 to the objectives of the group awarded this year's Nobel's Peace Prize.

Setsuko Thurlow, who was 13 when the U.S. bomb devastated her Japanese city during the final weeks of World War II, spoke as a leading activist with the Nobel-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

Thurlow said the Hiroshima blast left her buried under the rubble, but she was able to see light and crawl to safety. In the same way, the campaign to which she belongs is a driving force behind an international treaty to ban nuclear weapons, she said after ICAN received the Nobel prize it won in October.

""Our light now is the ban treaty,"" Thurlow said. ""I repeat those words that I heard called to me in the ruins of Hiroshima: 'Don't give up. Keep pushing. See the light? Crawl toward it.'""

The treaty has been signed by 56 countries — none of them nuclear powers — and ratified by only three. To become binding it requires ratification by 50 countries.

ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn, who accepted the prize along with Thurlow, said that while the treaty is far from ratification ""now, at long last, we have an unequivocal norm against nuclear weapons.""

""This is the way forward. There is only one way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons — prohibit and eliminate them,"" Fihn said.

The prize winners were announced in October. All except the peace prize were awarded in Sweden on Sunday.

The other laureates were American Richard Thaler for his work in behavioral economics; American physicists Kip Thorne, Rainer Weiss and Barry Barish for confirming the existence of gravity waves; and Jacques Dubochet of Switzerland, American Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson of the United Kingdom for advances in electron microscopy.

The cheapest individual coverage available in her market would eat up nearly a quarter of the income her husband brings home from the oilfields.

The Bryson, Texas, couple makes too much to qualify for Affordable Care Act tax credits that help people buy coverage. But they don't make enough to comfortably afford insurance on their own, even though Paul Leatherwood works seven days a week.

""I hate to put it like this, but it sucks,"" said Margaret Leatherwood, who stays at home and takes care of her grandchildren.

This largely middle-class crowd of shoppers is struggling to stay insured. They've weathered years of price hikes and shrinking insurance choices with no help. Faced with more price increases for next year, they're mulling options outside insurance or skipping coverage entirely — a decision that could lead to a fine for remaining uninsured and huge bills if an emergency hits.

The sign-up period for 2018 coverage closes on Friday in most states, meaning shoppers have only a few more days to find something that squeezes into their budgets.

""I kind of cringe when I am meeting with those clients because I don't have a solution for them,"" said Kelly Rector, a Missouri-based insurance agent.

The ACA helped chop the U.S. uninsured population 41 percent to 28.8 million people earlier this year from 48.6 million in 2010, when it became law, according to the latest government figures.

The law expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor and created health insurance marketplaces where people can use income-based tax credits to buy a single or family individual insurance plan if they don't get coverage through work. Those subsidies cover part or all of the bill, capping insurance costs at a percentage of income for those who are eligible. That shields recipients from price hikes of 20 percent or more that have hit many markets.

But that help stops abruptly for people making four times the federal poverty level or more — around $48,000 for an individual and more than $98,000 for a family of four.

Of the roughly 15 million people who bought ACA-compliant individual insurance for this year, nearly 7 million had no tax credit help, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Meanwhile, the uninsured rate among adults who make too much to qualify for help buying coverage jumped to 5 percent this year from 2 percent in 2016, according to The Commonwealth Fund.

Brokers and health care researchers expect that to climb again, especially for people with income levels close to the cutoff for federal help.

""It's not going to be like an on-off switch where prices get too high and nobody buys coverage,"" said Sherry Glied of New York University. ""It's more like a drip, drip, drip.""

The vulnerable population includes the self-employed, small business owners and those close to qualifying for the Medicare program that covers people age 65 and over.

These customers can face monthly bills that climb past $2,000 for a family plan and then a big deductible before most coverage starts. Plus fewer markets this year have insurance that comes with a health savings account, which lets people save for medical expenses before taxes. Those accounts are popular with individual insurance shoppers who don't get tax credit help, said St. Louis broker Emily Bremer.

Leslie Glogau said some of her customers in the Orlando, Florida area are considering short-term, limited-benefits plans that are cheaper than ACA-compliant coverage but can leave them vulnerable to big medical bills. Such plans also won't stave off the uninsured penalty, which can amount to a few thousand dollars depending on income.

""People just don't know which way to turn,"" Glogau said.

Insurance shoppers won't be fined if they can't find an affordable option in their market. But going uninsured would still leave them exposed to huge medical bills.

Margaret and Paul Leatherwood wound up with a limited-benefits plan this year, but they want better protection in case of a big bill. She's 58 and he just turned 60. They're weighing joining a medical cost-sharing ministry for next year.

These ministries are not insurance, but they allow people to band together to share expenses, often by making monthly payments. They can be cheaper than regular coverage, and belonging to one allows customers to escape the ACA penalty for remaining uninsured.

Such arrangements usually come with restrictions or qualifications. For instance, participants may not be allowed to use tobacco, and there might be limits on help for medical conditions that existed before the customer signed up.

""That's really the only option we have that's going to cover anything,"" Margaret Leatherwood said.

Lance and Stephanie Schmidt bought family coverage in the individual insurance market for years because they don't get employer-sponsored coverage through Lance's dental practice. But the Oklahoma City couple opted for a cost-sharing ministry this year after they realized the monthly insurance bill for their family of five would have more than doubled to over $1,200 and stuck them with a deductible that topped $7,000.

They now pay $450 a month for a plan through Liberty HealthShare, and they are leaning toward returning next year.

""There's still some risk there, but so far it has proven to be just fine,"" said Stephanie Schmidt.

Cost-sharing ministries and short-term plans aren't the only alternatives to individual insurance. Tom Morrill, a broker from Kansas City, Missouri, has helped many of his customers set up group coverage through their businesses.

He said that gives them better options than what they would find on the individual market, where coverage prices from the dominant insurer, Cigna, are climbing an average of 42 percent. Four insurers have left that market. The 10 remaining plans all have narrow networks of providers and don't pay for care outside those networks.

""It's nuts,"" Morrill said. ""Rates have jumped dramatically. It's not good coverage.""","emily bremer leslie glogau

Another woman worked at an Atlanta restaurant and says her boss did nothing when two dishwashers kept making vulgar comments, so she quit wearing makeup to look less attractive and hopefully end the verbal abuse.

In the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against several prominent men in entertainment, politics and journalism, accounts like the ones these women share quietly play out in restaurants, bars and hotels across the country and rarely get the headlines.

Court documents and interviews with the women and experts on the topic show hospitality industry workers are routinely subjected to sexual abuse and harassment from bosses, co-workers and customers that are largely unchecked. The nature of the work, which often has employees relying on tips, can make them especially vulnerable to abuse.

""I was absolutely humiliated,"" said Sharonda Fields, who said the abuse at the Atlanta restaurant began shortly after she started working there last year. ""It was degrading. I felt embarrassed. I felt low. I just felt like nothing happened when those guys talked to me that way, and especially when the staff and the managers knew what was going on. It made me feel like dirt.""

She filed a lawsuit against the restaurant last spring. Calls to the restaurant from The Associated Press went unanswered.

Joyce Smithey, an Annapolis, Maryland, attorney who has handled several sexual harassment lawsuits, said those accused of misconduct ""have a great sense of who the victims are, who the women are who will put up with this, who need the job, are so scared they don't fight back.""

That's especially true in an industry where immigrants are a large part of the workforce. In a 2014 federal lawsuit in New York that was ultimately settled, a woman alleged that the general manager of a fast-food restaurant where she worked asked about her immigration status regularly and knew that she was ""even more vulnerable"" partly because she had no family in the United States.

Many accusers think fighting back is futile. According to a survey in Chicago, not only had 49 percent of hotel workers reported incidents in which guests ""exposed themselves, flashed them or answered the door naked,"" but just 1 in 3 of the workers who had such experiences reported it to a boss.

Sarah Lyons, a research analyst with UNITE HERE Local 1, the union that conducted the survey last year and represents more than 15,000 hospitality workers in the Chicago area and northwestern Indiana, said the most common reason these workers didn't come forward is because they knew someone who tried to report sexual misconduct and nothing changed as a result.

Often things can get worse for those who report misconduct. Attorneys and advocates for workers say waitresses who speak out risk facing retaliation: Their shifts can be taken away or they might be scheduled for slower business times when there are fewer opportunities to receive tips.

In a 2011 lawsuit against a Maryland yacht club, Victoria Tillbery reported that a boss had told her she would ""never have to worry about your shifts"" if she let him perform oral sex on her. She refused and after she reported her allegations to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, her job started making her do her prep duties during shifts and not before them. That took her away from waiting tables and earning tips.

Attorneys say the goal in these situations is to prompt the employee to quit and, if that doesn't work, the worker is often made the target of an effort to discredit her character.

After Fields, the Atlanta restaurant worker, refused to quit, ""false and bogus reasons to terminate her"" surfaced, her attorney said.

""They enlisted another employee to falsely state that she (Fields) had come up to her and said, 'If you agree to back me up on my claim I'll pay you $100,'"" said Fields' attorney, Brad Dozier.

The other worker, hoping to gain favor with the bosses and get a promotion, made the false claim and the restaurant used it to fire Fields, Dozier said.

The woman who recounted the story about the Calumet City, Illinois, restaurant general manager, who suggested he would edit security camera footage of him inappropriately touching her, said she rebuffed the man's advances. After that, Vger Williams said, a job opportunity she was promised at one of the restaurant chain's other locations never developed and she was fired.

Williams filed a lawsuit last month. Restaurant officials declined comment when reached by the AP.

Workers who are sexually harassed by customers are often under pressure to remain quiet, too.

David Craver, president of the National Bartenders Association, said companies don't want to lose business so ""they roll out the red carpet to every customer.""

""It's just like if a family member said something inappropriate, you can't get rid of family,"" he said.

A lot of harassment occurs in situations in which the workers are underpaid, said Saru Jayaraman, co-founder of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a national organization that works to improve industry conditions. She said managers often encourage waitresses to dress sexier to get more tips, which can lead to sexual misconduct. If the workers were paid more, they wouldn't have to rely on tips and the misconduct would decrease, she said.

Improvements have shown up in other ways. In October, following the lead of voters in Seattle the year before, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance requiring hotels to develop anti-harassment policies and to provide panic buttons to workers by next summer if they work alone in guest rooms.

Also in October, celebrity chef John Besh stepped down from the company he founded after 25 women alleged that male supervisors at Besh's New Orleans restaurants sexually harassed them. One woman says Besh pressured her into a sexual relationship, but Besh has said he believes it was consensual.

While suing is one way victims of misconduct can fight back, most settlements contain nondisclosure clauses that prevent them from talking about what happened to them. So the incidents are not publicized.

""It fosters the problem we are seeing so much of (because) these serial harassers, bullies and predators aren't talked about,"" Boston employment attorney James Weliky said.","national bartenders association

KIM CHANDLER,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — In his sternest rebuke yet, Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said repeatedly Sunday his state can ""do better"" than electing fellow Republican Roy Moore to the U.S. Senate, making clear that a write-in candidate was far preferable to a man accused of sexual misconduct. Days before the pivotal race, Shelby, who is Alabama's senior senator, said he had already cast an absentee ballot for another, unspecified Republican, even as other prominent state Republicans fell in line behind Moore.

(AP) — In his sternest rebuke yet, Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said repeatedly Sunday his state can ""do better"" than electing fellow Republican Roy Moore to the U.S. Senate, making clear that a write-in candidate was far preferable to a man accused of sexual misconduct.

Days before the pivotal race, Shelby, who is Alabama's senior senator, said he had already cast an absentee ballot for another, unspecified Republican, even as other prominent state Republicans fell in line behind Moore.

Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in the special election Tuesday to replace Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general.

""I couldn't vote for Roy Moore. I didn't vote for Roy Moore. But I wrote in a distinguished Republican name. And I think a lot of people could do that,"" Shelby told CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""The state of Alabama deserves better,"" he said.

""There's a lot of smoke,"" Shelby said of Moore and his accusers. ""Got to be some fire somewhere.""

The accusations against Moore have left many GOP voters and leaders in a quandary. Voters face the decision of whether to vote for Moore, accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers decades ago when he was a county prosecutor, or sending Jones to Washington, which would narrow the GOP's already precarious majority in the Senate.

They also could write in a name on their ballots or simply stay home. Meanwhile, most GOP politicians in the state must run for re-election next year — where they will face Moore's enthusiastic voting base at the polls.

Shelby said allegations that Moore had molested a 14-year-girl in particular were a ""tipping point"" in disqualifying him. His latest comments cast fresh doubt on a former judge that President Donald Trump and most Republican leaders in Alabama are backing to help maintain the party's narrow 52-48 majority in the Senate.

Shelby's outspokenness against a man who could become his colleague was the exception rather than the rule.

""I have stated both publicly and privately over the last month that unless these allegations were proven to be true I would continue to plan to vote for the Republican nominee, Judge Roy Moore,"" Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill wrote in a text message to The Associated Press. ""I have already cast my absentee ballot and I voted for Judge Moore.""

The AP tried to find out how Republican leaders from Alabama plan to vote. Most officeholders or their staffs responded, while others have publicly stated their plans during public appearances or to other media outlets.

However, several officeholders did not respond to calls, emails or texts from the AP. They include U.S. Reps. Martha Roby, Mike Rogers and Gary Palmer, as well as state Treasurer Young Boozer and state House Speaker Mac McCutcheon.

State officeholders who said they intended to vote for Moore often cited the need to keep the seat in Republican hands.

In addition to Merrill, others who plan to vote for Moore include Gov. Kay Ivey; Attorney General Steve Marshall; state Auditor Jim Zeigler; Agriculture Commissioner John McMillan; state Senate President Pro Tempore Del Marsh; and Public Service Commissioner Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, who previously led the state GOP. Also voting for Moore are current state party head Terry Lathan and U.S. Reps. Mo Brooks of Huntsville and Robert Aderholt of Haleyville.

Shelby's decision has played prominently in Jones ads pointing out Republicans who are not voting for their party's nominee.

On Sunday, Shelby acknowledged that if Moore is elected, he would probably have to be seated in the Senate but that an Ethics Committee investigation was already been contemplated to remove him. ""I think that the Senate has to look at who is fit to serve in the Senate,"" he said.

CNN reported last month that U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne said he will vote Republican and that he does not cast write-in votes. In a statement to the AP, Byrne said it is up to voters to decide.

""Some serious allegations have been made and Judge Moore has vehemently denied them. Frankly, I don't think the people of Alabama want me, any national politician, or the national news media telling them what to think or how to vote,"" Byrne said in the statement. ""The decision is ultimately up to the people of Alabama to evaluate the information they have before them and make an informed decision. We must respect the voters' decision.""

Sen. Luther Strange, who lost to Moore in the Republican primary, did not respond to a request for comment from AP, but told The Washington Post recently that the election is up to voters.

""I'm staying out of it now. I think everybody knows how I feel about Judge Moore. We made our case and the voters made a different decision,"" Strange told the newspaper in a video on its website.

Sessions, who resigned from the Senate to join the Trump administration, declined to say how he would vote. Moore and Jones are competing for his old job.

""There have been some ads that may have suggested I endorsed a candidate, that is not so,"" Sessions said. ""I believe that the people of Alabama will make their own decision.""

State party loyalty rules could prohibit a GOP politician, or someone who aspires to be one, from publicly backing Moore's opponent. The rule says anyone who openly supports another party's nominee over a Republican could be barred from running as a Republican in the future.

Ivey became governor earlier this year after Robert Bentley resigned amid a sex scandal involving a much younger female political aide. When reached by the AP, Bentley declined to say who he is voting for Tuesday.

Ivey said last month that she has no reason to disbelieve the women who have accused Moore and is bothered by their allegations. But Ivey, who plans to run for governor in 2018, said she will vote for Moore anyway for the sake of GOP power in Congress. Her office did not respond to a request for an updated comment.

BEN WALKER,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Former Detroit Tigers teammates Jack Morris and Alan Trammell were elected to the baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday, completing the journey from Motown to Cooperstown. Morris, a big-game pitcher, and Trammell, a star shortstop, were picked by a 16-man Modern Baseball Era committee that considered 10 candidates whose biggest contributions came from 1970-87. Morris got 14 votes and Trammell drew 13, one more than the minimum needed. They'll be enshrined on July 29. Fitting that they'll go in together — they both began their big league careers in 1977 with Detroit, and played 13 seasons alongside each other with the Tigers.",2017-12-11T00:08:47Z,associated-press,"Tigertown: Morris, Trammell elected to baseball Hall of Fame",https://apnews.com/1b426eaf46304bc3a5507939694484cf,,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Fittingly, Jack Morris reached the Hall of Fame in extra innings.

Morris was elected to the Hall by its Modern Era committee on Sunday along with former Detroit Tigers teammate Alan Trammell, completing a joint journey from Motown to Cooperstown.

The big-game pitcher and star shortstop were picked by 16 voters who considered 10 candidates whose biggest contributions came from 1970-87. Morris got 14 votes and Trammell drew 13, one more than the minimum needed.

They will be enshrined on July 29, and fitting they'll go in together. They both began their big league careers in 1977 with Detroit and played 13 seasons alongside each other with the Tigers.

""The time that I've spent wondering if this day would ever come seems to be vanished and erased right now because it did come, and it's amazing,"" the 62-year-old Morris said during a conference call.

Trammell felt overwhelmed.

""I came to realization that it might not happen, and I was OK with that. I really was,"" he said. ""If people thought it was a tad short, I could live with that.""

Former catcher Ted Simmons fell one vote shy, and former players' union head Marvin Miller was five short of the 12 needed.

""It's not a big surprise,"" Miller's son, Peter, said from Japan. ""I think my father's place in history is understood by all baseball players, all baseball fans and the general public.""

Morris had 254 wins and seven more in the postseason, including his 10-inning shutout in a 1-0 win for Minnesota over Atlanta in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.

""No question it was my defining moment in baseball,"" Morris said. ""I never thought I was in trouble and I knew I could get out of it if I was. So I had the best mindset I've ever had in my entire on that night.""

Morris also pitched for World Series winners in Detroit — with Trammell, in 1984 — and Toronto in 1992. His 3.90 career ERA tops Red Ruffing's 3.80 as the highest of any pitcher in the Hall.

""For years my earned run average has been an issue for a lot of people that thought it was not good enough for Hall of Fame honors, but I never once thought about pitching for an ERA. I always thought about completing games, starting games, eating up innings and trying to win games more importantly than anything else,"" he said. ""Today's generation is different. In my heart of hearts I don't think for a second that guys that are pitching, the elite guys especially that are pitching in the game today, could not do what we did. I know they could. But they haven't been conditioned to it, both physically and mentally.""

His 175 complete games included 20 in 1983. The entire big league total this year was 59, and no pitcher had more than five. He said sabermetrics should not be used to evaluate his era.

""Now I'm getting analyzed by a bunch of numbers and things that didn't exist when I played, he said. ""Had they existed maybe I would have had a better understanding of what it would have meant to not pitch through pain, to not go deeper into games on nights that I told my manager, 'I'm fine' when I wasn't. But I don't regret doing that, because if you go to the wall and never try to push down the wall, you'll never know if you can.""

Now 59, Trammell was a steady presence in the middle of the diamond while playing all 20 of his seasons in Detroit, 19 of them next to double-play partner Lou Whitaker.

Trammell was the 1984 World Series MVP, hitting .450 as the Tigers trounced San Diego in five games and finished off a season in which they started out 35-5.

A six-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glover, Trammell scored 1,231 runs and drove in 1,003. He batted .285 with 185 home runs and a .352 on-base average — he walked 850 times and struck out 874.

Trammell never came close to election during his 15 tries in Hall voting by Baseball Writers' Association of America members, peaking at 40.9 percent in 2016. Starting at 22 percent in his first Hall ballot appearance in 2000, Morris reached at high of 67.7 percent in 2003, his next to last appearance.

Trammell's next visit to the Hall will certainly last longer than his first trip to the shrine in upstate New York. That was in 1995, when the Tigers played the Cubs in the Hall of Fame exhibition game.

Wearing his No. 3 jersey, Trammell jogged the couple blocks and hurried through the Hall in 30 minutes while the teams were limbering up at Doubleday Field.

""I definitely want to come back some day,"" he said that afternoon, ""but I probably wouldn't go through it in my uniform.""

Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Dave Parker and Luis Tiant also were on the ballot.

Miller, who headed the players' union from 1966-82 was on the ballot for the seventh time. Miller sent a letter to the BBWAA in 2008, four years before he died, saying he didn't want to be considered anymore.

The BBWAA annual vote on players will be announced Jan. 24. Chipper Jones, Jim Thome and Omar Vizquel are among 19 first-time candidates, and Trevor Hoffman, Vladimir Guerrero, Edgar Martinez, Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds are among the holdovers.

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams in the third quarter and would not return.

ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the Eagles are ""concerned"" that Wentz tore his left ACL, adding that Wentz's knee buckled as he walked off the field to head to the locker room. Wentz completed 23 of 41 passes for 291 yards, four touchdowns and an interception before exiting.

When the Eagles selected Wentz with the second overall pick of the 2016 draft, most expected him to be more of a long-term project for Philadelphia rather than a quarterback who could start right away.

Were it not for Wentz's hot start, his rookie year likely would've been painted in a more positive light. Instead, his 3,782 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions felt somewhat underwhelming since he had 769 yards, five touchdowns and zero turnovers through Philadelphia's first three wins.

Wentz still threw for more yards than any other rookie in 2016, and only Dak Prescott had more touchdowns (23).

Wentz has been excellent in his second season. Through his first 12 games, he has thrown for 3,005 yards and 29 touchdowns, while the Eagles have positioned themselves as one of the NFL's best teams.

The Eagles will now turn to Nick Foles, who's in his second stint with the team after signing with Philadelphia in March.

Foles has steadily declined since reaching the Pro Bowl in 2013, and he attempted just 55 total passes for the Kansas City Chiefs last year. Still, he's an experienced backup who should stabilize the passing game until Wentz returns.","aikengetty images philadelphia eagles

A surprise contender may be emerging should Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James opt out of his contract and enter free agency in July.

USA Today's Sam Amick reported Sunday some ""in Rockets circles"" believe Houston will have a genuine chance of signing James. Amick also spoke to NBA executives who shared the sentiment.

The allure of signing with the Rockets is obvious. They won 55 games last year in Mike D'Antoni's first season as head coach, and they have gotten even better with the addition of Chris Paul.

Whereas some teams struggle to assimilate their offseason additions into the rotation, Paul has made a seamless transition to D'Antoni's uptempo offense. The nine-time All-Star is averaging 14.3 points and 9.8 assists in his first 10 games with the team.

Most importantly, Paul hasn't adversely impacted the dynamic D'Antoni and James Harden created a season ago. The Rockets are second in offensive rating (112.9), according to NBA.com, and they own the league's best record (20-4).

If James is unable to topple the Golden State Warriors this season, few teams outside Cleveland would give him a better opportunity of dethroning the reigning champions.

With that said, it wouldn't be easy for Houston to sign James.

For one, the Rockets are on track to have the second-highest payroll in the NBA in 2018-19, per Spotrac.

Paul has a $39 million cap hold, so he could give the team some financial flexibility by agreeing to a reduced salary. Still, general manager Daryl Morey would need to shed a lot of payroll to accommodate a max contract for James. Trading Ryan Anderson, who will earn nearly $41.7 million over the next two years, or Eric Gordon, who will make more than $27.5 million over the same span, won't be easy.

The Rockets' struggles in the playoffs could factor into James' decision as well. Since Harden arrived in 2012, Houston has reached the Western Conference Finals only once. The team exited in the first round in three of its last five postseason trips.

Should the Rockets push the Warriors hard in the conference finals, James may feel confident he could partner with Harden and Paul to take Golden State down. Another playoff disappointment for Houston, on the other hand, could be disastrous to the team's hopes of landing the best free agent on the market.","james trading ryan anderson

New York Jets quarterback Josh McCown suffered a broken left hand during Sunday's 23-0 loss to the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field and did not return.

Jets head coach Todd Bowles told reporters of the diagnosis.

The quarterback also appeared to hurt his abdominal section earlier in the day before returning. He finished just 6-of-12 for 46 yards, plus an interception and a fumble.

Bryce Petty replaced McCown under center, facing what was already a 20-0 deficit at the time.

McCown, 38, played just one game in 2016 for the Cleveland Browns before breaking his collarbone in Week 2, leaving Cody Kessler as the starter. The Browns abstained from putting him on injured reserve, and McCown was able to return in Week 8, though he played in just five games overall, completing 54.5 percent of his passes while throwing for 1,100 yards, six touchdowns and six interceptions.

The Jets signed him in the offseason, becoming the eighth team McCown has played for in his NFL career. He came into the season as the presumed starter and was expected to be the bridge starter until either Petty or Christian Hackenberg was ready to take the reins.

McCown has been surprisingly solid, coming into the game throwing for 2,880 yards, 18 touchdowns and eight interceptions, helping lead the Jets to a better record than many expected prior to the season.

Ready or not, Petty will now be called into action.

While the Jets surprised many by being competitive this season, losing McCown does not bode well for their chances of success down the stretch.","jack dempseyassociated

Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage was ruled out for the remainder of Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers with a concussion, according to Texans PR.

Per Robert Littal of Black Sports Online, Savage's hands shook after he absorbed a big hit in the second quarter, and he returned to the game briefly before exiting again.

Savage was replaced by veteran T.J. Yates.

Savage, 27, won the team's starting job early in the offseason, though he kept it for all of one half after losing two fumbles and watching the Jacksonville Jaguars march out to a 19-0 lead. Deshaun Watson took over and was a revelation before tearing his ACL during practice in early November.

This season, Savage has thrown for 1,412 yards, five touchdowns and six interceptions.

With Savage sidelined, Yates now steps into the spotlight for Houston. The career backup has appeared in 19 games and entered Sunday's contest with 1,534 yards, six touchdowns and eight interceptions during his NFL tenure.

The Texans could also seek to upgrade the position in free agency while Savage is sidelined. Colin Kaepernick, for instance, would be an excellent fit for the zone-read attack the Texans utilized while Watson was healthy.

Regardless of how the Texans handle the Savage injury, quarterback went from being one of the team's strong points under Watson to a major weakness.","weston kenneyassociated press houston texans

Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston denied reports of a rift between himself and coach Dirk Koetter after Sunday's loss to the Detroit Lions.

""Me and Coach Koetter have a great relationship,"" Winston told reporters. ""It doesn't matter what anyone else can possibly say. Obviously a lot of stuff can come out when we're not doing as expected, but that's false.""

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said tension between Winston and Koetter was brewing over the direction of the offense and the team's handling of the quarterback's shoulder injury.

""Winston didn't feel fully supported as it relates to his injury. People didn't really know what he was playing through and how that contributed to his performance,"" Rapoport said Sunday.

Winston missed three games with a lingering shoulder injury before returning last week. He threw for 285 yards and two touchdowns against two interceptions Sunday, nearly leading the Bucs to a come-from-behind victory over Detroit.

Koetter is in his second year as the Bucs coach after taking over in 2016. Tampa went 9-7 last season and was considered a contender for the NFC South coming into 2017. The loss dropped the Bucs to 4-9, and they've lost Winston's last seven starts.

Ryan Fitzpatrick went 2-1 while filling in for Winston as the Bucs starter.","steve nesiusassociated

Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James evidently couldn't believe how the Browns fell to 0-13 on the season.

With the Browns leading the Packers 21-14 and under three minutes remaining in regulation, James tweeted support for the winless Browns:

""1 last stop @Browns!! Just 1 more.""

The Browns failed to produce that stop, as the Packers found the end zone and tied the game with 17 seconds on the clock.

Rookie Cleveland quarterback DeShone Kizer then threw a regrettable interception in overtime, and that mistake left the three-time NBA champion speechless:

James used colorful language after Green Bay wide receiver Davante Adams scored the game-winning 25-yard touchdown:

The King hasn't announced if he would attend an 0-16 Browns parade, but we're sure those planning the ""celebration"" would happily name him grand marshal.

Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr was blunt about his team's 26-15 defeat to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in Week 14.

""There is no easy way to put this one,"" Carr said, per NFL Network's James Palmer. ""We sucked. It sucked. It wasn't good enough and you can put it all on me. Don't put your blame on coach, one player. It's all my fault.""

Carr was 24-of-41 passing for 211 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in the loss.

Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio didn't mention Carr by name but seemed to place the blame squarely on the two-time Pro Bowler for Oakland gaining 268 yards of total offense.

""He’s the trigger man of our offense,"" Del Rio said, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal's Michael Gehlken. ""Our offense didn’t get done what it needed to get done today.""

Entering Sunday, the Chiefs ranked 24th in passing defense DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average), according to Football Outsiders. Not only has Kansas City's secondary struggled in 2017, it was without Marcus Peters, who was serving a one-game suspension.

Carr should've had a field day against a defense that was down its best cornerback. Instead, his 60.1 quarterback rating was his second-worst this season, according to ESPN.com.

More importantly, the Raiders fell a game behind the Chiefs in the AFC West with only three more weeks remaining.","charlie riedelassociated

"Rob Urban, Camila Russo","Bitcoin just landed on Wall Street, and not (yet) with a bang.",2017-12-10T23:22:23Z,bloomberg,"Bitcoin Futures Trading Opens, Bringing Crypto to Wall Street",http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/bitcoin-futures-trading-opens-bringing-crypto-to-wall-street,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i0pn6ps3xEI8/v0/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Bitcoin just landed on Wall Street.

Cboe Global Markets Inc. started letting traders buy and sell bitcoin futures Sunday evening. Though the exchange operator warned volume might be low -- new futures typically take time to build a following -- almost 600 contracts traded in the first hour. As of 7:36 p.m. New York time, contracts expiring in January were priced at $15,800, or about 3 percent higher than bitcoin itself, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The cryptocurrency spiked by more than $1,000 before paring the gain.

“It was pretty easy to trade,” said Joe Van Hecke, managing partner at Chicago-based Grace Hall Trading LLC, said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. “I think you’ll see a robust market as time plays out.”

The launch of futures is a closely watched watershed for bitcoin -- testing infrastructure that will make it easier for legions of mainstream investors to bet on the cryptocurrency’s rise or fall, potentially helping to steer its price. It wasn’t without some drama: Cboe’s website stalled during the launch. The company said its trading systems were fine, though.

Futures trading on a regulated exchange could lure professional investors and traders who had been reluctant, or prohibited by their investment rules, from buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the mostly unregulated markets where it’s traded for years. Some users of those little-policed venues have been targeted by hackers who’ve stolen digital tokens.

CME Group Inc.’s exchange is set to start offering similar futures next week. Investors, traders and even Cboe had been predicting transactions would start modestly before gaining momentum.

Some people who would like to trade the futures are having a harder time accessing the market because not all futures brokers are supporting it currently, said Garrett See, chief executive officer of DV Chain, a sister company of trading firm DV Trading. Participation may also be limited because of higher capital requirements and tighter risk limits, See said.

Being on the sidelines has been painful. This year alone, bitcoin’s up more than 1,400 percent. The surge has been driven largely by demand from individual investors, even as technical obstacles keep out big money managers like mutual funds.

With gains like that, “it feels like the top,” Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Investment Partners, which is raising a crypto hedge fund targeted at $500 million, said last week. “One reason that it might not be the top, in the short run even, is that usually markets end with exhaustion when there are no buyers left. This is a combination of, they can’t process the amount of buyers that want in. And so, I don’t think it’s the top. I think it could have been just a speculative frenzy.”

Derivatives trading is the culmination of a wild year for bitcoin, which captured imaginations and investment around the world, propelled by its stratospheric gains, and its anti-establishment mission as a currency without the backing of a government or a central bank, and a payment system without a reliance on banks. The derivatives contracts should thrust bitcoin more squarely into the realm of regulators, banks and institutional investors.

“There will be a ramp-up time,” said Ari Paul, chief investment officer of Blocktower Capital Advisors LP, said last week, before futures trading had started. “There just isn’t a rush. The professional traders will mostly be looking to do arbitrage, between the futures and bitcoin itself. I don’t expect massive money flows right away but then I expect gradual buying from people who want passive exposure” without buying bitcoin directly.

QuickTake: All about bitcoin, blockchain and the crypto world

Both Cboe and CME on Dec. 1 got permission to offer the contracts after pledging to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don’t run afoul of the law, in a process called self-certification.

Not everyone is convinced it’s a good idea. On Dec. 6, the Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. Last month, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that bitcoin’s large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn’t be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives.

Still, Interactive Brokers is offering its customers access to the futures, though with greater restrictions. They won’t be able to go short -- betting that prices will decline -- and Interactive’s margin requirement, or how much investors have to set aside as collateral, will be at least 50 percent. That’s higher than either Cboe’s or CME’s margin requirements.

QuickTake Q&A: Understanding bitcoin’s rapid price rise

Cboe’s futures are cash-settled and based on the Gemini auction price for bitcoin in U.S. dollars. The exchange plans to impose trading limits to curb volatility, halting trading for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and a five-minute halt kicks in at 20 percent. Margins for Cboe bitcoin futures, which will be cleared by Options Clearing Corp., will be at 40 percent or higher.

“The state of Alabama deserves better,” Shelby said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” citing the accusations of impropriety against Moore by multiple women. Shelby said he has already voted absentee and that he cast a write-in ballot for “a distinguished Republican” he declined to name.

Alabamans vote Tuesday in a special election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general. Shelby, 83, had said earlier in the campaign that he couldn’t support Moore. Yet doing so again on national television in such strong terms -- and less than 48 hours before voters go to the polls -- represented a dramatic and last-minute twist in a race that has whipsawed Alabama voters for months.

Moore, 70, won a primary election in August against Luther Strange, who’d been appointed to fill the seat on an interim basis. In recent weeks, Moore’s been accused of initiating a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old, sexually assaulting a 16-year-old, and romantically pursuing other teenage girls when he was in his 30s.

“I understand we would like to retain that seat in the U.S. Senate,” said Shelby, who has served in the upper chamber for 30 years. “But there’s a lot of stories out there. There’s a lot of smoke. Got to be some fire somewhere.”

Trump’s Backing

In making his comments, Shelby directly clashed with President Donald Trump, who has urged voters to support Moore despite the drumbeat of accusations -- many of which date to a period when Moore was a local district attorney in the 1970s and 1980s.

Trump staged a rally in Pensacola, Florida, close to the Alabama border on Friday night, and he tweeted his support for Moore on Saturday. The president also recorded a pro-Moore robocall expected to go out to voters on Monday, Politico reported.

A fellow Southern Republican, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, chimed in Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” appearing to support Moore’s accusers and underscoring the chaos that the former judge’s candidacy has created for the national Republican Party.

Scott said “the allegations are significantly stronger than then denial” when it came to the accounts provided by Moore’s accusers. If Moore wins, Scott added, “there will immediately be an ethics investigation.”

Distinct Audiences

Like Scott, Shelby appeared to be speaking to two distinct audiences. On one hand, they are targeting Alabama voters weighing Moore’s credibility and character against the possibility of voting for Democrat Doug Jones or a Republican write-in candidate in a state Trump won by almost 30 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

On the other are national Republicans, many of whom are unhappy at the prospect that Moore could be the party’s newest senator at moment when several lawmakers have resigned over sexual-harassment allegations.

Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said on Sunday she was “disappointed” that the Republican National Committee had resumed support for Moore after earlier distancing itself.

Collins said even before the sexual-harassment allegations, she was concerned about Moore’s history of anti-Muslim and anti-gay rhetoric and of his having twice been removed from his post as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for failing to follow lawful judicial orders.

Should Expel

Senator Cory Gardner, the Coloradan who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has said that if Moore wins, the Senate should expel him.

Shelby declined to say if he would support such an effort but said he believes Moore would immediately face an ethics committee investigation.

“I think that the Senate has to look at who is fit to serve in the Senate,” Shelby said.

Dean Young, a political strategist for Moore, downplayed comments that his candidate would immediately face an ethics committee investigation if elected.

“I highly doubt there’s going to be a Senate investigation,” Young said on ABC’s “This Week” program on Sunday. “But if there is, Judge Moore’s going to be found telling the truth, just like he always has.”

Young said the race is “ground zero” for Trump because if Alabama residents vote for “this liberal Democrat” Jones, they’re voting against the president they helped put in office and his agenda.

Brian Chappatta,"To BlackRock Inc.’s Rick Rieder, lost in the discussion about the flattening U.S. yield curve is the fact that shorter-dated Treasuries are the cheapest on a relative basis in a decade.",2017-12-10T05:01:00Z,bloomberg,BlackRock Is Buying the Bonds Most at Risk From Added Fed Hikes,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/blackrock-is-buying-the-bonds-most-at-risk-from-added-fed-hikes,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irtpTd2C8Y7E/v0/1200x787.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"To BlackRock Inc.’s Rick Rieder, lost in the discussion about the flattening U.S. yield curve is the fact that shorter-dated Treasuries are the cheapest on a relative basis in a decade.

And he’s a buyer.

Two-year Treasuries yield about 1.8 percent, rising from 1.25 percent just three months ago. As a result, the extra yield that investors get by extending to 10-year notes shrank to as little as 50 basis points last week, the smallest spread since 2007. The curve flattening makes sense -- the Federal Reserve is set to raise rates this week and projects more hikes in 2018. The two-year note is the most sensitive coupon maturity to central-bank policy.

Bond traders have already built in a buffer against further tightening, with the two-year yield more than 60 basis points above the effective fed funds rate.

Granted, if the Fed sticks to its projected path of three more hikes in 2018, short-term yields will climb even higher. But Colin Robertson at Northern Trust Asset Management only sees one 2018 hike. And for Rieder, who expects three, the value is still there, given that the investor would only hold the debt for a couple of years.

“We like the front end of the curve -- you carry really well in the front end for two years, three years,” Rieder, global chief investment officer for fixed-income at BlackRock, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday.

For all the talk about international buyers swooping in to buy long-term Treasuries and compressing the yield curve, the difference in yield on short-dated securities across countries is pretty stark too.

Investors pick up an extra 253 basis points from owning two-year Treasuries rather than their German counterparts. That’s the most since 1999.

And it wasn’t that long ago that the yield now available on the two-year U.S. maturity was the best one could hope for on a 10-year note. Four days before the 2016 American presidential election, the 10-year yield closed at 1.78 percent.

“To me, two years at 1.8 percent look very attractive,” Robertson, head of fixed income at Northern Trust Asset, said in an interview. Traders are mistaken if they’re anticipating “a lot of moves from the Fed.”

Neither Rieder nor Robertson see the yield curve inverting next year, unlike a growing chorus of Wall Street fixed-income strategists. Rieder says that’s because inflation will pick up and the 10-year yield will gradually rise to 2.5 percent or 2.75 percent. Robertson’s view is that the Fed won’t want to drive the curve toward zero, and will therefore slow its rate hikes.

Either way, the notion that the short end offers good value will serve as the bond market’s backdrop to this week’s Fed decision.

Gregory Viscusi,"President Emmanuel Macron said he doesn’t intend to immediately revive past French Middle East peace initiatives, and would wait to see what proposals emerge for the region from the Trump administration.",2017-12-10T17:31:26Z,bloomberg,Macron Says `Too Early' to Judge U.S. Mideast Peace Efforts,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/macron-says-too-early-to-judge-u-s-middle-east-peace-efforts,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iHrYOayjt9oo/v1/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"President Emmanuel Macron said he doesn’t intend to immediately revive past French Middle East peace initiatives, as Donald Trump’s administration stood behind his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the U.S. embassy there.

“It is preferable not to multiply initiatives because they end up cannibalizing each other,” Macron said Sunday at a press conference in Paris with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “We are favorable for waiting weeks, months, to see what emerges.”

Netanuyahu and Nikki Haley, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, both said Sunday that the decision on Jerusalem would help the Middle East peace process. Macron, though, called it “a danger to peace,” the crown prince of U.S. ally Abu Dhabi said it “extended a lifeline to terrorists,” and several Middle East leaders that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence planned to meet later this month said they now won’t see him.

Haley, in an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” said Trump had been careful not to delineate a border that would forestall negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over the latter’s call for the eastern part of Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state. “No outside group should decide what the final status looks like,” she said.

Read here why Hamas is calling for an uprising

Before heading to Paris, Netanyahu accused European leaders of double standards for criticizing Trump’s move but not denouncing the violent protests and attacks that ensued in Israel and Israeli-occupied territory over the past few days.

Continuing days of violence that left four Palestinians dead, protesters clashed Sunday with Israeli troops in the West Bank and a Palestinian stabbed and seriously wounded an Israeli security guard in downtown Jerusalem. The army said it had demolished a Palestinian attack tunnel running from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, the second discovered in recent months.

In Lebanon, protesters tried to break into the U.S. embassy in Beirut on Sunday.

Netanyahu said his comments weren’t aimed at Macron, who began his remarks by condemning all acts of violence against Israel.

What the Two-State Solution Hasn’t Solved

“The sooner the Palestinians come to grips with reality, the sooner we will find peace,” Netanyahu said. He added that Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years.

“There’s nothing new that Mr. Netanyahu considers Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel,” Macron said. “What’s new is that a powerful outside country unilaterally recognizes something that goes against international law.”

Pence will still meet with Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on his trip despite being rebuffed by others including Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said Jarrod Agen, Pence’s deputy chief of staff, in an email.

“It’s unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region, but the administration remains undeterred in its efforts to help achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians and our peace team remains hard at work putting together a plan,” he said.

Gesture Sought

Earlier on Sunday, Macron’s office said the president talked by telephone with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, urging him to tone down his reaction to Trump’s decision. Erdogan called Israel a “state of occupation,” prompting Netanyahu to say he wouldn’t accept lectures on morality from a leader who has bombed Kurdish villages, jailed journalists and helped Iran evade international sanctions.

Macron said he shared Erdogan’s opposition to Trump’s move and “underlined the necessity of avoiding negative repercussions throughout the region and contributing to an easing of tensions, to restore chances of peace,” his office said in a statement.

While awaiting any new proposals from the Trump administration, Israel should “make gestures towards the Palestinians,” such as freezing the construction of settlements, Macron said.

Previous French leaders, feeling the U.S. was stalling action on behalf of its ally, Israel, have tried to start initiatives to revive talks between Israel and the Palestinians, only to give up. Netanyahu said Sunday he’s always willing to sit down and negotiate with Abbas.

Netanyahu, who’s urged other countries to follow Trump’s lead on the contested holy city, is scheduled to meet foreign ministers from the 28-nation EU in Brussels on Monday.

Nacha Cattan,The leader of Mexico’s largest opposition group is stepping down from his post to prepare for a presidential run under a left-right coalition that’s looking to dislodge the ruling party from power.,2017-12-09T19:42:57Z,bloomberg,Mexico Opposition Leader Resigns for 2018 Presidential Bid,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-09/mexico-opposition-chief-resigns-to-pursue-2018-presidential-bid,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ieUatLXZaa2w/v1/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The leader of Mexico’s largest opposition group is stepping down from his post to prepare for a presidential run under a left-right coalition that’s looking to dislodge the ruling party from power.

Ricardo Anaya’s resignation as party president, effective this weekend, is the first step to seeking the nomination from his National Action Party (PAN) to run in 2018 against the party of President Enrique Pena Nieto.

His decision was confirmed by Santiago Creel, president of PAN’s national election commission, and Juan Adame, regional coordinator of PAN’s national executive committee. Anaya said in a Twitter message that he’s stepping down and will inform the public on Sunday of his plans.

Anaya’s party has been granted the power to choose the presidential nominee for the coalition. The coalition includes his PAN party, which has opposed legal abortion, and the Democratic Revolution Party, which has voted in favor of gay marriage. A third, smaller group, the Citizens’ Movement Party, is also part of the coalition.

In early polls the coalition has taken second place or been tied for first place ahead of the 2018 election. Anaya may still have to compete with other members of his party in a primary if any of them register for the presidential nomination. Primary campaigns officially begin in Mexico on Dec. 14.

‘Fundamental Question’

Anaya and his coalition say they represent an alternative to the PRI, which has been involved in a number of corruption scandals, and to the leftist candidate and early front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who’s put investors on edge with past pledges to reverse the government’s move to open Mexico’s oil industry to private drilling.

July’s election “raises a fundamental question: continuity or change. Do we continue on the same road toward corruption and inefficiency that the PRI represents, or do we propose a change,” Anaya said Friday at an event to register his coalition with the electoral regulator.

“There are two alternatives,” Anaya said. “One of old and failed ideas, the other what the electoral coalition represents, that of intelligent change and a vision for the future.”

The PRI has said it’s cracking down on graft, noting that many corrupt officials have been investigated or jailed. Lopez Obrador, meanwhile, has argued that Mexico’s economic model hasn’t pulled people out of poverty and needs to be revisited.

Polls Tight

Anaya has placed second to Lopez Obrador in some recent opinion polls, while a survey published Dec. 6 showed the pair in a dead heat, with each having support from 23 percent of respondents. PRI candidate Jose Antonio Meade, looking to succeed Pena Nieto, followed with 19 percent. Mexican presidents can serve only one six-year term.

Anaya, 38, has already served as president of Mexico’s lower house at a time when major economic reforms were passed, including the energy overhaul. As president of the National Action Party since 2015 he’s overseen several joint bids for gubernatorial elections with the left-leaning PRD, many of them successful.

Yet he’s also been accused of sowing division within his own party. Former first lady Margarita Zavala, wife of Pena Nieto predecessor Felipe Calderon, said Anaya engaged in undemocratic practices when she split from PAN to become an independent candidate for president in the 2018 race.","national election commission

Justin Ocean,What to buy the billionaire on your list this holiday season.,2017-12-06T16:53:52Z,bloomberg,A Gift Guide for the .0001%,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-06/a-holiday-gift-guide-for-billionaires,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ierdkHn9Eb8c/v0/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"At Bloomberg Pursuits, we understand: Life’s luxuries may make sense for most on your list, but there’s always one person who seems impossible to please. That’s why we’ve tossed the budget in search of the most rarefied experiences and exotic goods. Consider these 10 items your best chance at finding the upper hand in any gift exchange.

A Utopian Vision of Mars

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

Elon Musk can’t have all the Martian fun. As the P.T. Barnum of Futurism whips up excitement for sending SpaceX colonists to the Red Planet by 2024 (and shooting his midnight-cherry Tesla Roadster into orbit), your billionaire can take a more contemplative approach with a historic globe that imagines what life is like out there: “Mars efter Lowell’s Glober 1894-1914.”

The hand-inked and -colored manuscript orb was made by Emmy Ingeborg Brun, a Danish socialist and astronomer, from mistranslated drawings by Giovanni Schiaparelli that interpreted “canali” (natural channels) as man-made canals, evidence of a now-dying Martian population. In those lines, Brun saw evidence of a cooperative society and promoted Mars as a potential site for a socialist Utopia (not so unlike today’s space race). To spread the gospel, she started sending copies of the globe to museums and academic institutions around the world; only eight, including this one, have endured. The varnished, papier mâché globe comes on a bronze base inscribed with the words “Free Land. Free Trade. Free Men.” It would make a handsome mantelpiece item for any earthbound corner office.

Cost: 60,000 pounds ($81,000)

An Expedition to the North Pole

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

Naughty or nice is beside the point when you can skip the letter to Santa and go straight to the source instead. For those short on time, there’s a three-day helicopter flyover (from $20,995); for those long on insanity, the North Pole Marathon will take place on April 9, 2018 (entry fee: 16,000 pounds). For everyone else, Quark Expeditions offers two-week, all-inclusive trips aboard a Russian, nuclear-powered icebreaker to the geographic North Pole. (True magnetic north is a different point that constantly wanders and is best left for the on-board scientists to explain.)

What to expect? Blissful days unplugged from the internet, 24-hour sunshine, the surreal seascapes of Franz Josef Land, an occasional, helicopter-borne scouting mission, and the chance to spot polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales. Daily lectures by marine biologists, climatologists, and glaciologists will address the region’s essence. Once at 90°N—there’s no land here, just forever shifting, meters-thick sea ice—Quark will arrange a barbeque, Champagne toast, and (weather permitting) a hot-air balloon ride. The truly brave can even dunk in the frigid water. Sure, accommodations aren’t luxe (book the Arktika Suite), but that’s kind of the point: to walk away feeling less like a tourist and more like an accomplished adventurer. It’s one thing to say you’re on top of the world, but fewer than 700 people annually can claim literally to have been there.

Cost: $46,900 per person, with transfer package

An Animal-Relocation Safari

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

Animal conservation is a delicate dance that can fall victim to its own success: Too many elephants or rhinos in one area, and they eat all the plants; a juvenile lion kicked out of the pride is going to have a rough and bloody bachelor life, unless he has space to roam. Luckily, this is a problem money most definitely solves.

Charity Travel services travelers who yearn to go beyond Africa’s traditional, twice-daily game drives by matching them up with conservation organizations (Wildlife ACT, African Parks) that need funding to move endangered species out of overpopulated game reserves. Nobody is going to move a lion because a billionaire says so, but with enough notice (ideally a year) and Mother Nature’s blessing, guests can help out, getting up close and personal with the sleeping beastie while snagging a supreme selfie in the process. Rhino de-horning and wild-dog-collaring expeditions are also available—often on the same trip.

Cost: Six-night safaris, from $50,000 per person for lion relocations, $100,000 per person for rhinos, and upwards of $500,000 for elephants. (You have to move the whole herd.) Fees cover the entirety of moving the animal (e.g., helicopters, tranquilizer darts, veterinarians) as well as all-inclusive lodges, ground, and air transfers arranged via the region’s best high-end outfitters.

A Watch Worn by a Legend

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

Unless you’re the anonymous bidder who bought Paul Newman’s actual Paul Newman Daytona Rolex for $17.8 million, Christie’s has a few choice lots left in its Evening of Exceptional Watches. For men, nothing says swagger quite like Joe DiMaggio’s Patek Philippe ref. 130. The baseball legend acquired the 33mm, 18-carat gold chronograph in 1948. It’s still in fantastic condition, from its silvered, Breguet numerals to the original leather strap DiMaggio wore around his wrist.

The ladies in your life can be equally well-served at this auction. There’s a diamond-encrusted Gruen that belonged to jazz singer Billie Holiday during a pivotal moment of her career headlining at Café Society. An inscription reads “To Billie From David, 1938” on the back of the 11mm case; David’s identity is a mystery. Also inscribed is a Cresarrow silver travel watch with gold numerals and a Tiffany & Co. logo on a cream dial; British aviator Amy Johnson gave it to Amelia Earhart circa 1932 after Earhart’s history-making solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. “To Amelia, In Sincere Admiration, Amy”—the sentiment might as well land on whomever receives it.

Cost: High estimates range from $300,000 for the DiMaggio to $18,000 for the Holiday and $120,000 for the Earhart.

The Ultimate Olympic VIP Experience

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

What’s harder? Becoming an Olympic athlete or becoming a billionaire? Tough to say, but certainly the former is more difficult without the latter, as American athletes competing their way up the ladder receive no federal funding for training or coaching (unlike peers in most of the rest of the world). They need corporate and individual sponsors to make medals happen.

In that light, the Champions Club trip to the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, is a feel-good gift for the super-rich ski and snowboard patriots in your life. In return for their support of the U.S. team, they’ll be ensconced in white-glove luxury (from meals to hotels), provided VIP credentials, and invited to private victory celebrations with triumphant American athletes just hours after they’ve stepped off the podium. Two possible waves keep the trip intimate: Feb. 8–17 includes the opening ceremonies; Feb. 17-26 wraps the Games up.

Cost: For two people, a minimum $250,000 donation, plus an additional $90,000 for travel expenses. If your billionaire can’t make it to PyeongChang, U.S. Ski & Snowboard is running a World Championship trip to Åre, Sweden, (2019) and is already talking to donors about Beijing 2022.

An Aston Martin Submarine

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

Billionaires aren’t immune to ennui. After popping the umpteenth bottle of bubbly in the Jacuzzi, sailing up and down the Cote d’Azur can get so … typical. That is, until they take their Aston Martin submarine for a spin. Codenamed “Project Neptune,” the three-person vehicle is the fruit of a collaboration with Florida-based Triton Submarines LLC, a leader in luxury submersibles. Silver, blade-like pontoons give the vessel a silhouette that a Bond villain could appreciate, while the air-conditioned acrylic bubble of a cabin allows unfettered views of underwater domains down to 1,650 feet. The 5.9-foot-tall sub weighs just over 4 tons and can cruise at 3 knots, or 3.5 miles an hour. Deliveries start next year.

Cost: $4 million

Their Name in Lights

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

While nothing says “I’ve made it” quite like 10 figures in the bank, having your billionaire’s name emblazoned on the side of the local baseball stadium certainly states the case. Right now, the home parks for the Washington Nationals, Miami Marlins, and Seattle Mariners are all up for grabs, while the Los Angeles Dodgers are soliciting offers for just the stadium’s grass and dirt. Terms can run into decades and cost millions (the Mariners, for instance, are seeking upwards of $5 million per season), so you may want to double-check their fan interests.

Less controversial—barring any billionaire infighting—is to sponsor a collection or exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The Philadelphia Museum of Art also offers opportunities for shouting a permanent “Adrian!” via naming rights to specific galleries in its landmark building; prices start at $500,000 and proceed to $75 million, according to location, size, and visibility. Endowments to name staff positions begin at $750,000.

Cost: A pretty penny. But if you want to cheap out, trees in the MoMA sculpture garden start at $5,000; a bench in Las Vegas’s Mob Museum fetches $15,000.

A Private Island for the Apocalypse

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

In an uncertain world, everybody could use a good escape plan. And if a $14 million, bunker-ready home in Atlanta (stocked with buckets of dehydrated chili mac) is a bit too close to home, there’s always New Zealand. The isolated South Pacific nation is already a popular bolthole for the mega-rich to hedge their bets should the U.S. or Europe start to go belly-up—Jack Ma, Peter Thiel, Alexander Ambramov, and hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson have all reportedly put down for multimillion-dollar hideaways in the Kiwi countryside.

Still, for your billionaire, only the best: Pakatoa, a 59-acre private island in the Hauraki Gulf, just a 15-minute helicopter ride from Auckland. The facilities that remain from Pakatoa’s previous life as a holiday resort (1965-2000) may be “extremely tired,” but the whole complex has a certain vintage, Lost-like appeal: tennis courts, a bowling green, nine-hole golf course, solarium, and swimming pool, plus enough outbuildings to accommodate an extended clan. The temperate, sunny weather in this region of the North Island makes for prime yachting, too, with a deepwater dock at the ready.

Cost: $24 million, and buyers could qualify for New Zealand residency as well.

An Iconic Automobile

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

Time may be the ultimate luxury—something to be savored, once you’ve achieved major success—but you’d never know it from today’s endless pursuit of the shortest sprint times, highest top speed, and most extreme, seven-figure supercars. A vintage Ferrari, counterintuitively, may be just the ticket to remind your billionaire to slow down.

On sale at RM Sotheby’s Icons auction in Manhattan, this 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Cabriolet Series II (chassis 3009 GT) by acclaimed designer Pininfarina is the epitome of a classic touring Ferrari. Its luscious curves and high-revving, vociferous V12 don’t mind making themselves known, but they also nod toward a more languorous life, saying “I’ve got this” to whatever may be round the bend. Fully restored, with dark Grigio Ortello paint and a tan-leather interior, and with only 600 miles since the restoration, it’s a concours- or rally-ready addition to any blue chip collection.

Cost: Estimated at $1.5 million to $1.8 million

One’s Very Own Cask of Scotch

Illustration: Cynthia Kittler

Don’t get us wrong, giving a four-figure bottle of booze makes a nice gesture. But 600-some bottles of the stuff? Not even your snobbiest, Scotch-loving friends should scoff at that. With offices in Edinburgh and Singapore, Cask 88 sources a selection of primary- and secondary-market casks from brand-name distilleries (Macallan, Dalmore, Bowmore, Laphroaig) as well as since-closed producers with cult cachet (Rosebank, Port Ellen) to sell as alternative assets or passion projects.

Each cask is unique, and samples are available: Does she or he prefer the heathery spice of the Highlands, the smooth approachability of Lowland-style, the fruit notes in a Speyside single malt, or an Islay peat bomb? All casks are stored in bonded warehouses, often at the original distillery, and that’s when the fun begins. The Cask 88 team provides expert guidance on maturation (including re-casking to a new finish), advises when it’s time to bottle (or sell), designs bespoke packaging, and can arrange visits to the ‘Precious’ through the years.

Cost: Varies widely. A five-year-old, second-fill bourbon barrel of Craigellachie (61.3 percent alcohol by volume, 109 liters/approximately 255 bottles) can be had for a mere 3,825 pounds, while a 35-year-old sherry hogshead of Bowmore (45 percent ABV, 57.5 liters/approximately 182 bottles) runs 323,960 pounds. Storage itself is rather cheap: about 500 pounds for every 10 years of maturation.","brandname distilleries macallan dalmore bowmore laphroaig

Kyungji Cho,North Korea said visiting United Nations officials agreed to communicate on a regular basis and help ease tensions on the Korean peninsula.,2017-12-09T04:23:48Z,bloomberg,China Airs Pessimism on North Korea as Kim Touts UN Talks,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-09/north-korea-says-un-expressed-willingness-to-ease-korea-tensions,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iZOVS.3Z0jhM/v0/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"China expressed pessimism about bringing the North Korean standoff to a peaceful resolution, even as Kim Jong Un’s regime touted new United Nations support for “regular” talks.

Chinese Foreign Minster Wang Yi said Saturday “the outlook is not optimistic” on the Korean Peninsula and urged all sides to end what he said was a “vicious cycle” of confrontation. Wang’s remarks -- part of a broad foreign policy speech in Beijing -- came hours after North Korea said a departing UN delegation had agreed to communications to help ease tensions.

Wang said there was still hope for a diplomatic solution to the frictions over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. He reiterated a Chinese ""freeze-for-freeze"" proposal for North Korea to suspend weapons tests while the U.S. halts military drills in the area. “The first step to pull the situation on the peninsula out of the current ‘black hole’ of confrontation is to create the conditions and atmosphere to restart dialogue,” Wang said.

The UN’s top official for political affairs, Undersecretary General Jeffrey Feltman, left North Korea on Saturday. His visit came as the U.S. sent a B-1B bomber to join massive aerial drills with South Korea after Kim recently tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach any American city.

The UN move was part of a flurry of efforts involving countries from Canada to Germany to try and facilitate talks between Kim’s regime and the U.S.

Still, there have been no negotiations with Pyongyang for years on its nuclear program, with Kim refusing to agree to U.S. demands he first halt his arms development, and North Korea in turn accusing the U.S. of planning an invasion and regime change. Repeated calls by South Korea and China for talks have failed to gain traction, even as Kim accelerates his weapons capability with a series of missile and nuclear tests.

North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency said Saturday that Feltman’s visit contributed to a deeper understanding and that they agreed to communicate at “various levels.”

“The UN secretariat’s side expressed its readiness to make a contribution to the relaxation of the tension on the peninsula under the UN Charter,” KCNA said. It added Feltman paid a “courtesy call” on Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and held talks with a vice minister of foreign affairs.

Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, said in an emailed statement on Saturday that Feltman “emphasized the need for the full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions.”

Feltman noted “the urgent need to prevent miscalculations” on the volatile Korean Peninsula, and the benefit of open channels to reduce the risks of conflict, Dujarric said in the statement. The North Korean officials and Feltman agreed that the situation there was “the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue in the world today.”

‘Not Meaningful’

“I don’t believe this in itself is meaningful,” said Shin Beomchul, a professor at Korea National Diplomatic Academy. North Korea wanted to use the UN to gain legitimacy and get the U.S. to acknowledge it as a nuclear state, he said.

The U.S. has refused to consider negotiations while Kim tests increasingly powerful nuclear bombs and lobs missiles into the sea around Japan. In an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said the Trump administration would be ready for talks if North Korea renounced further launches.

Any UN mediation effort would require approval from the UN Security Council, where the U.S. wields veto power. The Security Council has called for the resumption of the so-called six-party talks, which included China, Japan, Russia and South Korea and broke off in 2009.

North Korea Defies the World With Nuclear Ambitions: QuickTake

Weapons tests by North Korea have prompted the Security Council to pass sanctions blocking about 90 percent of that nation’s reported exports, including coal and seafood, as well as imports of some oil products. The KCNA report said Feltman acknowledged the negative effect of sanctions.

U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to pressure China to rein in its ally and neighbor before it acquires a nuclear arsenal advanced enough to deter a U.S. attack. Kim said the recent ICBM test showed North Korea’s nuclear program was complete because it could send an atomic warhead anywhere in the U.S.

While analysts doubt North Korea can deliver a miniaturized nuclear bomb to the U.S. -- including ensuring it survives the heat of reentry to Earth’s atmosphere -- the test put new pressure on the U.S. and its allies to find a solution. By declaring his weapons program complete, Kim may have created a path to resume negotiations from a position of strength.

“North Korea’s effort to strengthen relations with the UN is an extension of its announcement it completed its nuclear program last month in that both aim for negotiations with the U.S.,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.

Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, said all avenues must be pursued to avoid conflict.

“Hope for peace has not yet been eliminated,” Wang said. “The prospect for negotiations still exists. The choice of using force is absolutely unacceptable.”

"Wael Mahdi, Mohammed Sergie","OPEC and its global allies including Russia may end their production cuts before 2019 if the crude market re-balances by June, Kuwait’s oil minister said.",2017-12-10T10:49:40Z,bloomberg,Kuwait Says Global Oil Cuts Can Halt If Market Balances by June,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/kuwait-says-global-oil-cuts-can-halt-if-market-balances-by-june,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i.6AfQuGvxzs/v0/1200x800.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Issam Almarzooq, Kuwait's oil minister, looks on during a news conference at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, Austria, on Friday, Sept. 22, 2017. Oil is heading for a third weekly gain before an OPEC-led committee meets in Vienna to discuss ongoing production curbs.

OPEC and its global allies including Russia may end their production cuts before 2019 if the crude market re-balances by June, Kuwait’s oil minister said.

Russia is keen to end the output-capping deal as early as possible, Issam Almarzooq told Bloomberg on Sunday in Kuwait City. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will study an exit strategy from the global cuts accord at its next meeting in June, he told reporters later.

“We still have a full year left in the agreement, but there is a possibility that we exit the cuts agreement before 2019 if the market is re-balanced by June,” Almarzooq said. “There is pressure from Russia to exit the deal as soon as possible” once the market is balanced, he said.

OPEC and its partners agreed on Nov. 30 to keep curbing production until the end of next year, in a bid to drain oversupplied world markets and prop up prices. Crude dropped in the week after their decision to extend the cuts as investors turned attention to expanding U.S. oil production and gasoline stockpiles. Prices have since edged higher as near-record Chinese orders for foreign crude signaled stronger demand in the world’s second-largest economy.

Price Outlook

U.S. crude production expanded for a seventh week to 9.71 million barrels a day, the highest level in weekly data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration since 1983. Gasoline inventories surged by 6.78 million barrels last week, the biggest gain since January.

Kuwait sees a full re-balancing of the oil market by the end of 2018, Almarzooq said on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. Prices should remain near current levels in 2018, he said.

United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said it was premature to comment on when OPEC will exit the production cuts agreement. OPEC plans to discuss the exit strategy in June but can meet at anytime if needed, he said in Kuwait.

Iraq’s Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said it was “too early to speculate” on what OPEC and its partners in the cuts will decide in June.

“It depends on the market,” al-Luaibi said in Kuwait. “We have an entire year ahead of us. OPEC made a decision to monitor the market, and now it’s studying the market. The developments in the market will be the factor that contributes to decisions.”","organization of arab petroleum exporting

John Binder,"President Trump is warning Alabama voters against voting for Democrat Doug Jones in the Alabama Senate election this week, saying in a robocall that Jones in the United States Senate would be a blow to his ""America First"" immigration agenda.",2017-12-10T14:22:01Z,breitbart-news,Trump: 'If Alabama Elects Liberal Dem Doug Jones' Pro-American Immigration Agenda 'Will Be Stopped Cold',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/12/10/trump-alabama-elects-liberal-dem-doug-jones-pro-american-immigration-agenda-will-stopped-cold/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/12/trump-rally.png,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"In a robocall for populist conservative Roy Moore, Trump pleaded with Alabama voters to support his pro-American immigration agenda — which includes building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, deporting illegal aliens, punishing sanctuary cities that harbor criminal illegal aliens, opposing amnesty and reducing legal immigration levels to benefit American workers — by opposing Jones in the December 12 election.

Trump says in the robocall:

“Democrat Jones is soft on crime, weak on immigration, supports abortion, he’s bad for our military and bad for our vets,” Trump says. “We don’t want him. And he also, by the way, wants higher taxes.”

“If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold,” Trump continues.

“We need Roy voting for us,” Trump says. “I’m stopping illegal immigration and crime, rebuilding a stronger military and protecting the Second Amendment and our pro-life values.”

Jones has taken immigration positions that have put him in-line with the open borders lobby and corporate interests, all of which advocate for more immigration and more imported foreign workers while American workers are forced to compete with a cheaper, imported foreign workforce, further driving down their already stagnant wages.

Most recently, as Breitbart News reported, Moore slammed Jones’s silence on sanctuary cities, which are local jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials, thus giving safe haven to criminal illegal aliens.

Moore said in a statement:

My opponent supports amnesty and has stated that he sees no need for a border wall and has said nothing about sanctuary cities. His election would be a threat to the safety and well-being of the people of Alabama and the United States at large.

When previously asked about sanctuary cities, Jones deflected the question.

“I’ll let someone else talk about sanctuary cities in California,” Jones told the Montgomery Advertiser in July.

Despite its popularity among Alabama voters, Jones has increasingly been a vocal opponent of Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that would serve as the first path to ending illegal immigration in the country.

As Breitbart News reported, Jones said of the wall:

“No, I do not. I think it’s too expensive,” Jones told Fox News when asked if he supported the construction of the border wall. “I don’t think we need to be spending $20 billion dollars,” Jones continued, blasting the border wall. “I want to put it on healthcare, I want to get tax cuts for the middle class.”

Jones’s supposed concerns about the cost of the border wall fail to mention the annual cost of illegal immigration that, while benefitting multinational corporations and the wealthy upper class, has been a detriment to America’s working and middle classes.

As Breitbart News reported, most recent estimates by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), reveal that an illegal alien costs each American taxpayer approximately $8,075, totaling a burden of roughly $116 billion annually.

Jones even went as far as to use talking points from the most pro-open borders governor in the country, California Gov. Jerry Brown (D), Breitbart News reported. In July, Jones compared the building of a border wall to stop illegal immigration to the Berlin Wall, the same comparison made by Brown just months earlier.

Aside from opposing Trump’s border wall, Jones also supports giving amnesty to illegal aliens. Last month, Jones said he not only supported the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program but also supported the DREAM Act, which could lead to all 12 to 30 million illegal aliens in the U.S. receiving a pathway to citizenship.

I support the DACA program and would support the DREAM Act or similar legislation to ensure young people brought here as children who have never known any other nation can remain in the United States.

Moore, on the other hand, not only supports Trump’s border wall, but also supports overall reductions in legal immigration, vowing to support the RAISE Act, which would cut legal immigration down from roughly 1 million new immigrants a year to 500,000 a year, in order to give relief and raise wages for American workers.

“We need to look at the RAISE Act … the Reform of American Immigration for a Strong Economy. We need to look at vetting these people coming into our country,” Moore previously said. “And pick people that are going to do something for our economy. That’s what [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions says.”

The call will hit that many or more Alabamians before election day, a source familiar with its reach told Breitbart News.

In the more-than-minute-long robocall, President Trump calls on Alabama voters to rise up to back conservative Roy Moore over radical leftist Democrat Doug Jones.

“Hi, this is President Donald Trump and I need Alabama to go vote for Roy Moore,” the president says in the call, audio of which was reported by ABC News. “It is so important. We’re already making America great again. I’m going to make America safer and stronger and better than ever before but we need that seat. We need Roy voting for us. I’m stopping illegal immigration and crime, rebuilding our military and protecting the Second Amendment and our pro-life values. But if Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold. We already know Democrat Doug Jones is a puppet Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and he will vote with the Washington liberals every single time. Democrat Jones is soft on crime, weak on immigration, supports abortion, he’s bad for our military and bad for our vets. We don’t want him, and he also, by the way, wants higher taxes. Roy Moore is the guy we need to pass our Make America Great Again agenda. Roy is a conservative who will help me steer this country back on track after eight years of the Obama disaster. Get out and vote for Roy Moore. His vote is our Republican Senate, and it’s needed. We need Roy to help us with the Republican Senate. We will win and we will Make America Great Again.”

Trump’s robocall effort is the most significant yet in the state of Alabama from the president on behalf of Moore, who faces the radical far-outside-the-mainstream leftist Democrat Doug Jones on Tuesday in the Dec. 12 special election. Jones supports full-term abortion, opposes the border wall, backs DACA and another amnesty for illegal aliens, opposes tax cuts, supports Obamacare and even backs transgenders in the military. Moore, on the other hand, is a conservative Republican well in the mainstream of where Alabama voters are on the issues.

President Trump at a rally in nearby Pensacola, Florida, on Friday again publicly endorsed Moore.

“We cannot afford … to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate,” Trump said in Pensacola. “We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our ‘Make America Great Again’ agenda … So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it.”

He also exposed Jones as the radical leftist Democrat he is during that Pensacola rally.

“We can’t afford to have a liberal Democrat who is completely controlled by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,” the president said. “His name is Jones and he’s their total puppet and everybody knows it.”","morethanminutelong robocall

Jeff Poor,"Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” a panel, featuring AL.com columnist Kyle Whitmire, Huntsville, AL radio talk host Dale Jackson and The Washingtonian’s Elaina Plott, analyzed the role of the media in week’s U.S. Senate special election in Alabama.

Stelter wondered why some Alabamians are still supporting Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore, despite allegations against that he acted inappropriately toward underage females decades ago.

Whitmire argued media queries often reinforced why Moore’s base supported him. Jackson responded by pointing out how Moore and President Donald Trump have had success weaponizing the term “fake news,” and argued that the media had itself to blame.

Jackson pointed to a 2015 AL.com column from Whitmire in which a poll question was included about Moore’s sexuality, and suggested it was media attacks like that as to why many Alabama voters don’t trust the media.

Partial transcript as follows:

BRIAN STELTER, HOST, CNN’S “RELIABLE SOURCES’: So, let’s talk about what the next 48 hours of campaigning in store and what could happen Tuesday night.

Kyle Whitmire is here. He’s a state political columnist for The Alabama Media Group. Also, Dale Jackson, the host of “The Dale Jackson Show” on WVNN Radio in Alabama and Elaina Plott, staff writer for The Washingtonian. She’s a native Alabamian who has been covering the election for the magazine.

Kyle, lots to talk about. Let’s start with Roy Moore and his campaigning or lack thereof.

Is it true that he’s mostly missing from the campaign trail in these key final days?

KYLE WHITMIRE, STATE POLITICAL COLUMNIST, ALABAMA MEDIA GROUP: Right. Even before these allegations came out, he was pretty scarce on the campaign trail. Roy Moore has always been a candidate who sort of lets his opponents do a lot of the heavy lifting for him. He has a very, very loyal base in the state.

And when his opponents attack him, when the media questions him, that only just re-enforces their support for Roy Moore. So, yes, he’s been scarce. He’s — even before these allegations, he’s certainly been scarce since these allegations came out, and has not been making himself available to much media except for talk shows and other forums that are sympathetic or friendly to him.

STELTER: Dale, you are a conservative radio host in Huntsville. Have you been able to get the candidate on your show?

DALE JACKSON, HOST, “THE DALE JACKSON SHOW” WVNN: Roy Moore has not come on my radio show in months, and I don’t expect to get him on my show before this election takes place or afterwards. I’ve been very unfriendly to Roy Moore for years here. And the real question about this is why the people don’t believe what the media is saying and the reason is simple — lots of retractions. Donald Trump, a pathological liar, has weaponized the term “fake news” and your guy sitting right there, Kyle Whitmire, months ago, years ago, excuse me, wrote a piece asking if Roy Moore was gay.

Why in the world would anybody listen to the stuff that’s coming out of those outlets? That’s the real problem here.

STELTER: Kyle?

WHITMIRE: Look, these allegations are — they’re credible. And, yes, you know, Dale is right about the piece I wrote years ago. The question was whether this was following a narrative that we’ve seen over and over again with his vitriol toward the LGBTQ community.

But let’s face it — this is an apparatus, a reality distortion field that the Republican Party and the right has created and it’s been in effect here in Alabama that gives people license to disbelieve things that they don’t want to be true.

STELTER: So, I wonder, Elaina, as we think about the broader context here, if this is a preview of what the midterms are going to be like? If Republican candidates are going to run against the press, especially if it works for Roy Moore on Tuesday?

ELAINA PLOTT, STAFF WRITER, WASHINGTONIAN: Well, I can tell you that, I know you cited a poll that is a tossup between Moore and Jones. But I believe, as I have from the beginning of this election, that Roy Moore will win on Tuesday.

And I think what that’s going to show to every single Republican candidate going forward, especially a Chris McDaniel in Mississippi against Roger Wicker, that the media is a credible opponent, that elections for Republicans do not have to be about ideology any longer. Squaring up against an opponent based on policy proposals. You can weaponize fake news as this president has done so well and rally the base around that and feel comfortable going into a Tuesday election.

STELTER: Doesn’t that mean something is broken in our society?

PLOTT: Well, I would say so. But I also think it points to — you know, I kind of think we forget it wasn’t until President Trump that the term “fake news” coursed through society so easily. I mean, you can walk down the street and hear anyone use the term “fake news”, whether jokingly, ironically or not, but I do think that’s a signal that this is a pretty embedded part of our culture at this point and reporters are going to have to consistently come up with ways to make sure that they’re being respected and listened to in spite of that.

STELTER: Dale, you know, I would say that sometimes you’re on the radio tearing down the press, discouraging people from trusting real reporting. I think you might say that we deserve it, right?

JACKSON: Well, the simple fact is this — there has been an agenda against Roy Moore in the state of Alabama going back a decade. Why in the world would people believe the things that are said if it’s always negative over and over and over and over again? That weaponizes the term fake news.

You guys have to look inside your own house to make that conversation, because the bottom line is this — people don’t trust you guys and the reason they don’t trust you is because you are constantly telling them they are wrong, they are stupid, they are racists, and then we’re saying, hey, listen to us you wrong, stupid and racist people. It’s not going to work, they don’t trust you guys.

STELTER: When you say they don’t trust you guys, I think what you mean, Dale, is there’s a percentage of the country primarily conservatives who for years and decades have just trusted the press, who do not trust mainstream reporting. It is not a majority of the country.

JACKSON: I would say it’s a pretty big number. Donald Trump was able to become president of the United States using this same attack. You pointed out a minute ago, Roy Moore is doing the exact same thing.

This election is about Roy Moore and Roy Moore only. None of us sitting on this panel know what Doug Jones believes on absolutely anything because it has become a battle between Roy Moore and you guys and he’s going to win.

STELTER: I do think it’s a problem that Doug Jones has not received more coverage. You just saw a tweet, Kyle, from a viewer who said the media hasn’t really covered the election. They’ve only covered Moore. Quote, you barely know Jones was also running.

Has that been a problem, Kyle, for you on the ground there?

WHITMIRE: I don’t believe that’s fair. I mean, look, yes, we don’t cover houses that aren’t on fire, right? Doug Jones is a pretty vanilla Democrat. That’s sort of what he’s put himself out there as a generic Democrat, for the purpose of not trying to get nailed down on certain issues.

You know, he has had problems with his stance on abortion, but other than that, you look up and down on his list of issues. It’s what you would expect from a Democrat.

Meanwhile, you have Roy Moore who is not a typical Republican in a lot of respects, you know, to the point that this morning, Richard Shelby came out on your network criticizing him again and something that, you know, he couldn’t have criticized him more directly if he were writing an attack ad for the Jones’ campaign.

So, look, yes, we — there has clearly been more coverage of Roy Moore, just because he is such a spectacle and such an abnormality.

STELTER: Elaina, Kyle, Dale, thank you all for being here. I appreciate it.

JACKSON: Thank you.

PLOTT: Thank you, Brian.","alcom columnist kyle whitmire huntsville al radio

The rhetorical bombast may have overshadowed his broader project, of which the Alabama contest constitutes only one small, if unexpectedly lurid, part.

Mr. Bannon has insisted that his intraparty efforts in a “season of war” on the Republican establishment are about nothing less than a basic reorientation of what the parties fight about and who is on which side.

The term for that is “party realignment.” Overhyped claims of an overturned political order are a staple of American politics — just ask the last would-be architect of a new Republican majority coalition, Karl Rove. Mr. Bannon is hardly alone, however, in seeing the potential for realignment in the volatile electoral party dynamics that carried Donald Trump to the White House.","coalition karl rove

Kristina Wong,The U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State on Sunday congratulated the Government of Iraq on its announcement of the liberation of Iraq from ISIS.,2017-12-10T15:17:30Z,breitbart-news,WINNING: U.S.-Led Military Coalition Congratulates Iraq on Liberation from the Islamic State,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/12/10/winning-u-s-led-military-coalition-congratulates-iraq/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/12/iraq1.png,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State on Sunday congratulated the Government of Iraq on its announcement of the liberation of Iraq from ISIS.

“The Coalition congratulates the Government of Iraq on its announcement of the liberation of Iraq from Daesh,” a statement from the coalition said, using a derogatory Arabic term for the terrorist group.

“Much work remains, and we will continue to work by, with and through our Iraqi partners to ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh and prevent its ability to threaten civilization, regionally and globally,” said Army Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk II, commander of Combined Joint Task Force—Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR).

The announcement by the Iraqi government formally marked the end of a more than three-year occupation of major territory in Iraq by the terrorist group, which had subjugated Iraqi civilians to a life of brutality and violence in areas under its control.

“Honorable Iraqis: your land has been completely liberated. The dream of liberation is now a reality,” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in a televised address, according to Reuters. “We have accomplished a very difficult mission. Our heroes have reached the final strongholds of Daesh and purified it. The Iraqi flag flies high today over all Iraqi lands.”

He declared December 10 a national holiday to be celebrated every year.

The terrorist group, in a lightning attack, swept into Mosul and other areas of Iraq in the summer of 2014, threatening the capital of Baghdad itself.

The Obama administration, which had withdrawn all U.S. forces in 2011, sent U.S. forces back to Iraq, beginning with a few hundred advisers. That presence grew to an officially-recognized number of 5,262, but actually included thousands more who were in Iraq on an unofficial, part-time basis.

The Obama administration also sent an official number of 503 U.S. troops into Syria, which obscured hundreds more on the ground on a part-time basis. There were also thousands more U.S. troops based across the border in Kuwait, and in the region.

President Trump campaigned on defeating ISIS, and earlier this year, granted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and U.S. commanders in the field more authority to go after the terrorist group. Mattis implemented an “annihilation” strategy that aimed to surround and annihilate ISIS fighters, instead of an “attrition” strategy that was simply shifting ISIS fighters from one place to another in Iraq.

A coalition official at an undisclosed location in Southwest Asia told reporters from Breitbart News and other outlets visiting the region with Mattis last week that once coalition-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, ISIS’s morale collapsed.

“Once Mosul fell, they lost confidence,” the official said.

The U.S. military presence in Iraq and Syria is shifting from one supporting offensive operations against ISIS to stabilization—in other words, advising Iraqi forces on holding territory liberated from ISIS and returning life back to normal, according to defense officials.

There is no timeline for withdrawal for U.S. forces in either area, but the overall number of U.S. troops is expected to go down. The Pentagon said last week there are about 5,200 U.S. troops in Iraq and about 2,000 in Syria.","obama administration

So excluding Fox, the worst mistakes that press organizations have made in the coverage of Trump has precisely occurred in their effort — their overzealous effort to be fair to the president.”

Daniel Nussbaum,Netflix talk show host and leftist activist Chelsea Handler stepped up her attacks on White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders this weekend by posting a video featuring an impersonator mocking Sanders's appearance.,2017-12-10T08:24:21Z,breitbart-news,Chelsea Handler Escalates Attack on Sarah Huckabee Sanders with Video Mocking Her Appearance,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/12/10/chelsea-handler-escalates-attack-sarah-huckabee-sanders-video-mocking-appearance/,http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/12/HandlerSanders.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Netflix talk show host and leftist activist Chelsea Handler stepped up her attacks on White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders this weekend by posting a video featuring an impersonator mocking Sanders’s appearance.

In the video, posted to Handler’s Twitter account, comedian Fortune Feimster wears a wig in an attempt to resemble Sanders as she runs through an exaggerated beauty routine.

“I used to not know what foundation was, but our great president was kind enough to take me to a Sephora, and he said to the boy, ‘Hey, you see that fella over there? Make him a woman,'” Feimster-as-Sanders says in one of many digs at the press secretary’s looks in the short clip.

The video comes just a few days after Handler — who recently announced her intention to dedicate herself full time to political activism after Netflix canceled her talk show — first attacked Sanders by calling her a “harlot” who wears “whore lipstick.”

Handler’s video drew strong condemnation on social media from users who accused the talk show host of hypocrisy, for regularly claiming to be a feminist while denigrating another woman’s appearance.

“Glad to see how much of a strong feminist you are, by promoting positive body image of other females,” one user wrote to Handler.

“This woman deserves to be taken down. She is pure evil,” Handler replied.

Handler also lashed out at Sanders’s father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, telling her he “raised a liar.”

A feminist @GovMikeHuckabee is someone who supports other women. A feminist is someone who believes the accounts of 15 different women who have similar stories about our President. A feminist doesn’t discount other women. Your daughter is not a feminist. You raised a liar. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) December 7, 2017

This woman deserves to be taken down. She is pure evil. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) December 8, 2017

Huckabee appeared on Fox News over the weekend to comment on the attacks on his daughter, explaining that Handler was likely “jealous” that Sanders is a “balanced” person.

“She seems to be just in a rage. The sad thing about it, she boasts about the two abortions she had at 16. I think in many ways she’s jealous of my daughter,” Huckabee said.

“My daughter has a husband who loves her and is wonderful to her. My daughter has three delightful children. She’s a happy balanced person,” he added. “My daughter has enjoyed life. She’s a pretty straightlaced person. She goes to church and lives a life Chelsea Handler has never known.”

Handler has regularly used her social media account to attack President Donald Trump, his family members, and administration officials.

Earlier this year, the comedian mocked First Lady Melania Trump by saying she could “barely speak English,” and in March, attacked Trump’s then-unborn grandchild in a mocking tweet, misspelling the word, “genes.”

She previously described Trump as “everything that’s wrong in the world.”

Handler was back to attacking the president on Saturday, calling Trump a “fraud on the American public.”

You are a fraud on the American public. You are the least trusted and worst president this country has ever seen. Stop attacking people who tell the truth. You wouldn’t the know the truth if Russia told it to you. #fake election https://t.co/WMy2l2BVop — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) December 9, 2017

Liquidity appears to be thin and Cboe's website has crashed.

The price of bitcoin soared by more than $1,000 after the contracts went live.



Bitcoin futures went live on Cboe Global Markets, the Chicago-based exchange group, Sunday evening and the price of the red-hot coin shot up.

Cboe's future contracts, which trade under the ticker XBT, allow investors to bet on the future price of bitcoin. Bitcoin shot up over $1,000 after investors could start purchasing contracts at 6:00 p.m. ET.

According to data from CoinDesk, bitcoin soared from $14,509 a coin at 5:59 p.m. ET to $15,704 at 6:07 p.m. It gave up some of those gains and was trading at $15,178 at 6:11 p.m. The futures contracts were trading at $16,000 soon after the market went live, higher than where bitcoin was trading in the spot market at the time of print.

Trading in the early stages seemed to be muted, with only a couple hundred contracts purchased. Most trades were of just one contract.

Still, interest in the new market appeared to put pressure on Cboe. Its website experienced outages soon after trading of bitcoin futures was underway. Here's Cboe in a tweet:

""Due to heavy traffic on our website, visitors to http://www.cboe.com may find that it is performing slower than usual and may at times be temporarily unavailable. All trading systems are operating normally.""

""The launch is going as expected sans [Cboe's website] crashing,"" John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist of GFI Group, told Business Insider. ""It speaks to the interest in bitcoin. There hasn't been this much interest in something since the internet boom.""

Bitcoin futures are the latest evolution in the market surrounding the cryptocurrency, which has appreciated more than 1,400% this year. Two other exchange operators are also set to launch their own bitcoin futures contracts.

There are a number of reasons why bitcoin futures products are a big deal for Wall Street and the world of crypto. First, the launch of bitcoin futures by establishment firms is likely to to open the door to wider participation in bitcoin trading by other Wall Street firms. It could also pave the wave for an exchange-traded fund, which could bring more investments into the space. Most importantly, it could help dampen bitcoin's spine-tingling volatility.

Right-wing figures latched onto new reports last week that two investigators on Mueller's team expressed views favoring former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

FBI veterans refute that characterization, saying agents don't let political views interfere with their work.

One former federal prosecutor called the strategy a ""weapon of desperation.""



Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election is ramping up, and with it, President Donald Trump's allies are reaching new heights to discredit Mueller and the Russia probe.

The special counsel has so far charged four of Trump's former associates as part of the investigation: former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former adviser and Manafort associate Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mueller is also said to be building an obstruction-of-justice case against the president, stemming mainly from Trump's decision to fire FBI director James Comey in May.

As Mueller's investigation pushes on, Trump's loyalists in politics and the media have launched a campaign focused on painting the special counsel and his investigators as biased and partisan, while echoing Trump's demands that the FBI also investigate Comey and Trump's former opponent, Hillary Clinton, over their alleged Russia ties.

Conservative talking heads and Trump allies latched onto a string of damaging reports this week about investigators on Mueller's team.

The Washington Post reported that Peter Strzok, a widely respected FBI counterintelligence veteran who used to work with Mueller on the Russia investigation, was ousted in July because he exchanged texts with a colleague at the FBI that could have shown that he favored Clinton over Trump.

Another report said that Strzok was the official who changed Comey's final characterization of Clinton's use of a private email server from ""grossly negligent"" — which would have carried criminal penalties — to ""extremely careless.""

Andrew Weissman, a seasoned prosecutor on Mueller's team who specializes in ""flipping"" witnesses, was also roped into the controversy when the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch released an email on Tuesday in which Weissman praised former acting attorney general Sally Yates for refusing to defend Trump's initial travel ban in January. It also emerged this week that Weissman attended Clinton's election night party at the Jacob Javits Center in New York last year.

Right-wing media lashes out

The revelations drew intense backlash from Trump loyalists.

Sean Hannity, the Fox News opinion commentator who is one of Trump's staunchest defenders, called Mueller's team ""extremely biased"" and ""hyper-partisan"" on Tuesday. He added that Mueller's investigation ""has put the country now on the brink of becoming a banana republic.""

""Mueller's stooges are literally doing everything within their power and then some to try and remove President Trump from office,"" Hannity told his 3 million viewers.

On Hannity's show Wednesday night, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett called Mueller's investigation ""illegitimate and corrupt,"" and accused the special counsel of using the FBI as a political weapon and acting as ""America's secret police.""

""Secret surveillance, wiretapping, intimidation, harassment and threats,"" Jarrett said. ""It's like the old KGB that comes for you in the dark of the night, banging through your door.""

Jarrett added that the FBI had turned into a ""shadow government.""

Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham weighed in on the controversy, as well.

""What we are seeing here is a pattern and practice of Mueller hiring known Clinton and Obama political insiders and boosters, supporters, to undo a presidential election. That was the election of Donald Trump,"" she told viewers on Tuesday.

The right-leaning Wall Street Journal editorial board published a column on Monday pointing to the Strzok texts as evidence of bias on Mueller's team. The board said Mueller was too conflicted to ""investigate the FBI and should step down in favor of someone more credible.""

Trump, who has frequently referred to the Russia investigation as a politically-motivated ""witch hunt,"" threw in his two cents on the Strzok revelations last week, retweeting Twitter user Paul Sperry, who said Strzok was ""busted"" and calling for FBI director Chris Wray to ""clean house"" at the bureau, which he claimed was ""infected"" by anti-Trump bias.

""After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History!"" he tweeted. ""But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.""

'A weapon of desperation'

Former federal prosecutors and FBI agents agreed that investigators should be careful about expressing their personal views while working on politically charged cases, but they pushed back on the claims of bias on Mueller's team from Trump's allies.

""I can tell you I never knew what Andrew [Weissman's] politics were when we were in the same office,"" said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor and longtime white collar defense lawyer who worked with Weissman in the past.

""Politics never comes up between prosecutors in my experience. We have them, of course. We are citizens. But among the feds I worked with, it would have been incredibly inappropriate for anyone to express a political view at work.""

Cotter also added that in the law enforcement field, it was ""rather irrelevant"" to point to officials' political affiliation. ""If you allege bias by someone carrying out their job, point to facts, not fact-free arguments that all Republicans will be corrupt against Democrats or vice versa,"" he told Business Insider.

Joseph Pelcher, a former FBI counterintelligence operative who was stationed in Russia and specialized in organized crime, said that while agents should be careful about openly expressing their opinions, ""there is certainly nothing wrong with holding political views as long as it doesn't interfere with an investigation.""

LaRae Quy, who served as a covert operative at the FBI for 24 years, largely echoed that point.

""It's very important for agents to appear (and be) apolitical. I know that's 'pie in the sky' since we all have political views,"" she told Business Insider. ""But the non-partisan aspect of an agent's job is important.""

That said, ""agents are allowed to express their personal opinions ... and encouraged to vote and be responsible citizens,"" Quy said. ""Almost every agent I know votes and upholds the democratic process. They are just smart enough to keep their mouth shut and their minds open.""

Mainstream conservatives jump on the bandwagon

But it looks like the right-wing and far-right talking point has trickled into the comments of more mainstream conservative figures and lawmakers.

""If it's true that Andrew Weissmann attended Hillary's victory party, this is getting out of hand,"" tweeted Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.

During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, in which Wray was testifying, Republican Rep. Steve Chabot called ""the depths of this anti-Trump bias"" on the special counsel's team ""absolutely shocking.""

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley said this week that Strzok's behavior and involvement in the Clinton email investigation and the Trump-Russia probe ""raises new concerns of inappropriate political influence in the work of the FBI.""

Grassley also demanded more information about Strzok's communications with Lisa Page, the FBI lawyer with whom he exchanged texts about Clinton and Trump.

""The question really is, if Mueller was doing such a great job on investigating the Russian collusion, why could he have not found the conflict of interest within their own agency?"" asked Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina.

Meadows was likely referring to the 2010 Uranium One deal, which was approved by the Obama administration. After the deal made its way back into headlines in October — shortly before Manafort and Gates were indicted — a growing chorus of conservative legislators and commentators began calling for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a second special counsel to investigate Comey's and the Clinton Foundation's roles in the deal's approval.

Extensive reporting and fact-checking found no signs of wrongdoing when the Obama administration allowed Rosatom, a Russian nuclear energy firm, to acquire Canada-based Uranium One, which had significant mining stakes in the US. The deal required approval from several government agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which Clinton had no control over.

Cotter said Sunday that the emergence of the right wing's argument that Mueller or his investigators are politically biased against Trump seems to be ""strong circumstantial evidence that those who fear what the Mueller investigation may find have no actual fact-based criticisms to make.""

Their ""reliance on character attacks,"" he said, are ""a weapon of desperation.""","rightleaning wall street journal editorial board

Maxwell Tani,Sen. Bernie Sanders said President Donald Trump...,2017-12-10T17:59:14Z,business-insider,A growing chorus of Democratic Senators are calling on Trump to resign over sexual misconduct allegations,http://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-want-trump-resign-over-sexual-harassment-2017-12,http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5a2d6df28a49868b358b4c0e-1190-625/a-growing-chorus-of-democratic-senators-are-calling-on-trump-to-resign-over-sexual-misconduct-allegations.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Sen. Bernie Sanders said President Donald Trump should consider resigning over sexual misconduct allegations made against him.

Several Senate Democrats have called for the president to resign in recent days, though they have stopped short of calling for his impeachment.

They spoke up after Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota resigned over his own sexual harassment accusations.



Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Sunday that he thinks President Donald Trump should consider stepping down over his sexual misconduct allegations.

In an interview on ""Meet The Press,"" Sanders noted that Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota resigned after several women accused him of sexual harassment.

""Al Franken felt it proper for him to resign,"" Sanders said. ""Here you have a president who has been accused by many women of assault, who says on a tape that he assaulted women. He might want to think about doing the same.""

The Vermont Senator this week joined a number of Democratic Senators who have called for the president to step aside in the wake of Franken's resignation, citing the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump as well as the president's own boasts about grabbing women without their permission.

In an interview with Vice News last week, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey suggested that the president should follow Franken's example and step down.

""I just watched Al Franken do the honorable thing and resign,"" Booker said. ""My question is — why isn't Donald Trump doing the same thing? Who has more serious allegations against him, with more women who have come forward?""

On Thursday, Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon similarly called on Alabama GOP candidate Roy Moore and the president to step aside, pointing to the allegations of harassment against both men.

""The president should resign because he certainly has a track record with more than 17 women of horrific conduct,"" Merkley told ""Meet The Press Daily.""

For his part, Trump has never made any indication that he would resign willingly before the end of his term, and plans to run for reelection.

The president has repeatedly denied all harassment allegations against him, and has asked Democratic leaders who will run against him in 2020. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Trump told the leaders that Sanders would run ""even if he’s in a wheelchair.""

Though 58 Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump this week, Democratic leadership and many Senate Democrats like Sanders have largely avoided the issue. Sanders said he's not prepared to support impeaching Trump yet.

""I don't think we're there right now,"" Sanders said on Sunday, saying special prosecutor Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election was working to uncover the Trump campaign's role. ""That's what the Mueller investigation is all about.""","the

The Bills had put out a call for volunteer shovelers earlier in the weekend, but the ongoing snow has proved their efforts fruitless.

A ""Snow Bowl"" game so dramatic hasn't been seen since 2013.



Snow has taken over Buffalo, New York, making Sunday's game between the Bills and Colts a cold, wet, and low scoring affair.

After the Northeast was covered in snow on Saturday, the Bills were doing what they could to take preemptive measures to ensure the game could go on as scheduled, putting out a call asking for fans to shovel the field, offering $11 an hour plus a ticket to the game for anyone who put in four hours.

But when Sunday came around, the snow still had not let up, and now the Bills and Colts are playing in a ""Snow Bowl"" game the likes of which the NFL hasn't seen since the Eagles and Lions met on a snowy Sunday in 2013.

Visibility for fans in the stadium is not great.

The scoreboard at far end is no longer visible. Worst I’ve seen it here that I can recall. pic.twitter.com/KlKRrXK0DG — Sal Maiorana (@salmaiorana) December 10, 2017

Of course, Twitter users were quick to have fun with the situation.

With just 30 seconds left in the first half, the Bills scored the first points of the game, with Nathan Peterman connecting with wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin in the end zone.

Noah Friedman and Nathaniel Lee,Chelsea Miller started making custom knives in 2011 and has grown her client list to include some of the best chefs in the world.,2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,business-insider,These are the $800 knives that celebrity chefs like Mario Batali swear by,http://www.businessinsider.com/chelsea-miller-knives-how-to-make-a-custom-chefs-knife-mario-batali-2017-12,http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5a2ada52a3b47486088b4bbc-1190-625/these-are-the-800-knives-that-celebrity-chefs-like-mario-batali-swear-by.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Chelsea Miller started making custom knives in 2011 and has grown her client list to include some of the top chefs in the world. Business Insider visited her Brooklyn studio to learn how she does it. Following is a transcript of video.

Chelsea Miller: I'm Chelsea Miller and I make knives.

Some of the world's best chefs use her knives.

Chelsea Miller: The chefs at Eleven Madison, Mario Batali, Massimo Bottura. Chefs who make some really, really delicious food. Let's say that.

And they don't come cheap.

Chelsea Miller: My smaller knives start at $200, the largest knife, the chef knife are $800.

I moved to New York when I was 18 and I was singing, dancing, acting, and as much as I love that kind of storytelling, I grew up in Vermont on a farm, homeschooled, my father was a blacksmith, and I was really missing that quality of working with your hands and that creative process.

So I went home for a while at the end of 2011 and started playing around in my father's shop. These knives came out of that exploration.

My friends encouraged me to take out a booth at the Brooklyn Flea and the Brooklyn Flea is an incredible place to be as a creator because there's an incredible amount of foot traffic and a lot of high profile writers, photographers, chefs. And that's how I got my first publications in Saveur Magazine and The New York Times and it really blew up from there.

Most of all my knives have a grater on the side, which is very unique because I've never seen a knife with a grater, but also that is the original function of the original material that I make it from. They're made from horseshoe rasps which have that rasp on the side that was originally used for filing horse's hooves. So in my mind, I thought, ""Why take that away?"" We can incorporate that into this new tool.

Since I've started my own business, I've noticed a real progressive movement towards more and more and more handmade things and a lot more consciousness about where you items are coming from. Trying to buy things that are going to last you your lifetime instead of something that's meant to be thrown away the second you open it.

I leave a window of about three to six months. If I were making one knife at a time, that would take me a couple of days, but because I have so many I tend to make them in batches, so as many as I can, I start from the beginning process, maybe 10 knives at the same time. So for a few weeks I'll be working on those first initial processes on those knives altogether. Then I'll move on to the next stage.

I use the forge for all of my smaller knives and essentially what we're doing is we're heating the metal and then using the hammer to hammer out the metal, lengthen the metal, to give us a longer, smoother material. And I don't do that with the chef's knives because I want to leave that grater on the side of the knife.

So with the larger chef's knives, I've already cut out the pieces in Vermont with an oxy acetylene torch and then once I get them here, I start the stock removal process. So I start with my bench grinder, grinding away the excess metal on one side to leave the grater on the other.

And then I'll move to my belt sander, and using a series of belts that go from very coarse to very fine, I'll bring that blade down to a fine edge and make it all shiny and smooth and sharp.

Each piece, depending on the way that it looks, it calls for a different piece of wood. So I'll shuffle through a lot of wood to find the right wood for the right knife.

And we'll cut out the wood, we will sand the handle a little bit, then we'll drill the holes, glue it together, clamp it, and then wait for it to cure. I usually let it cure for about 24 hours.

Then we'll take that off, sand the handle down, all the excess glue off the edges. And then we'll put a final sharpen on the blade, oil up the handle, and it's ready to go off and cut some vegetables.","mario batali massimo bottura

Joe Ciolli,BlackRock Global Chief Investment Officer of...,2017-12-10T13:01:00Z,business-insider,BlackRock's $1.7 trillion bond chief tells us his biggest market fear,http://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-cio-rick-rieder-biggest-market-fear-2017-12,http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5a2ad3afa3b474ee048b4bbc-1190-625/blackrocks-17-trillion-bond-chief-tells-us-his-biggest-market-fear.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"BlackRock Global Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income Rick Rieder shared his biggest market fear with Business Insider as part of a wide-ranging discussion.

Rieder has concerns over complacency creeping into global markets.



If you ask 10 different money managers for their biggest market fear, you might get 10 different answers.

That's not necessarily because some large reckoning is on the horizon. It's more a reflection of how difficult it is to pinpoint the next big disruption.

That said, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock, who oversees $1.7 trillion, is probably someone whose advice you should heed. Having worked at the highest level of money management for multiple decades, Rieder has seen it all through tough market cycles in 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002.

In an interview with Business Insider, Rieder shared his biggest market-related worry. He also gave his thoughts on the Federal Reserve's next steps, the GOP tax plan, the equity and bond markets, and the rise of exchange-traded funds.

It was part of a wide-ranging discussion that also included a deep dive into Rieder's hectic daily schedule, which you can read about here.

Here's what Rieder had to say (emphasis ours):

""Complacency. Some areas of the financing market are too high. Central banks flooded the system with liquidity, and now they should pull back. If you don't have that normal give and take that markets generally calibrate to, prices end up being too high for too long, or yields too low, and you get a complacency that's not good.

That's my biggest fear going forward. The longer you don't recalibrate — and build up volatility in the markets — that can create a bad outcome with real reverberations. It could adversely affect the lending dynamics in the country and shut down companies from investing.

I think what the Fed is doing now is the exact right thing, but I think the ECB and BOJ should start moving as well. Central banks need to pull back and reach some equilibrium.

Geopolitical risk also keeps me up at night, but I don't sleep much anyway, and that will always be there.""","complacency

Richard Shelby explained on Sunday why he didn't vote for Roy Moore.

The senior US Senator from Alabama said he wrote in another Republican, but refused to disclose the Republican's name.

Several women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct, and pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.



Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spoke out against GOP candidate Roy Moore in an interview just two days before the special election to fill the state's US senate seat.

In an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Shelby explained that he did not vote for Moore and instead voted for an unnamed Republican write-in, citing the numerous accusations that Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls.

""I couldn't vote for Roy Moore, I didn't vote for Roy Moore, but I wrote in a distinguished Republican name, and I think a lot of people could do that,"" Shelby said.

""I think the Republican party can do better,"" he added at the end of the interview.

Shelby said the he believed the women who have accused the GOP Senate nominee, noting that there was ""a lot of smoke, gotta be some fire somewhere,"" but understood why President Donald Trump was continuing to back Moore.

""I understand where the president is coming from; we would've liked to retain that seat in the US Senate,"" Shelby said. ""But I tell you what, there's a time — we call it a tipping point. And I think so many accusations, so many cuts, so many drip, drip, drip. When it got to the 14-year-old story, that was enough for me. I said I couldn't vote for Roy Moore.""

Shelby, who supported Sen. Luther Strange in the Alabama Republican primary, previously suggested that Moore should consider dropping out, joining a number of Senate Republicans who have opposed Moore's candidacy since reports revealed the former judge's history of alleged repeated sexual misconduct.

The Senator's comments came just days before the election that recent polls show is a virtual toss up. Moore has denied all of the accusations, painting the women's stories as a liberal smear campaign.

A number of national Democrats have descended on Alabama in recent days to hit the trail for Moore's opponent, Doug Jones, a former US attorney. The special election is on Tuesday.

The company recently raised a massive $250 million (£186 million) round from Japanese investment firm SoftBank.

Business Insider Nordic caught up with Slack's CEO and cofounder Stewart Butterfield to get the latest on the company, its relationship with Microsoft as a competitor, and more.



Slack – the fastest-ever startup to reach a $2 billion (£1.5 billion) price tag – now employs 800 people from Tokyo to Dublin. Overseas markets have surpassed the US in terms of usage and revenues are in the hundreds of millions. IBM and dozens of other Fortune 100 companies rely on the colorful chat app that first exploded among Bay Area startups.

But Stewart Butterfield, the company's outspoken yet media-shy chief executive, is not one to slow down. He raised a $250 million (£186 million) round in September from the SoftBank Vision Fund to muscle up for global expansion and to send a signal ""that Slack is here to stay.""

Although SoftBank described Slack as ""the operating system for today's fast-moving businesses,"" there are plenty of competitors that claim the same distinction.

In particular, the year-old Microsoft Teams – with its potential pool of almost 100 million Office 365-based users, or ten times Slack's overall weekly user base – is raising the stakes in a high-growth enterprise market already populated by players like Atlassian, Oracle, and Facebook Workplace.

Butterfield recently joined Business Insider Nordic to discuss how Slack aims to fight off competition, the ""surprising"" journey to $5,1 billion (£3.8 billion), and his one signature skill.

The Canadian tech icon and former Flickr cofounder was joined by Johann Butting, Slack's Head of Sales of the EMEA region. The following interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Highlights of the interview

Stewart Butterfield on…

The four-year journey with Slack. ""At the beginning, we thought that one day we could get to like $100 million in revenue and that would be the end of it. We blew past that last year, and we're still growing incredibly quickly [with $200 million (£150 million) in annual recurring revenue this year]. So the market opportunity is a lot bigger than we thought at that time. We didn't think about dentists using it, or police detectives using it, we didn't think about people using it in the context of restaurants or a million other things. [...] I think [the opportunity for B2B collaboration software] is at the same scale as Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Google.""

Whether the competition worries him. ""By 2025 we expect the majority of communication to take place in channels; now that could be in Slack, or something similar. The biggest challenge we might face is if someone created a new Slack-like product that's even better. We don't anticipate that happening – we created the category and we have three years of feedback which helped us build a great product. [...] Microsoft is the main competitor. They're the third largest company in the world and if they start channeling all their resources against you, that's a lot to compete with.""

Whether Slack will become a tool for not just internal, but external comms. ""I think it can. [...] We just launched a new feature called Shared Channels a couple of months ago, and the uptake has been fantastic. That will be an important thing for the future. But I don't see Slack transitioning into a principally external tool. [Potentially], we're moving more into helping the business relationships between companies, whether that's invoicing, or secure transmittal of documents or payments or anything like that.""

The Nordics and Sweden: ""We have 3,000 companies in Sweden using Slack. Sweden's definitely number one in Europe – and could be number one in the world on a per capita basis. Sweden's use is probably comparable to San Francisco Bay area, in other words 90% of the startups use Slack. I think there's a predisposition towards the common good in Swedish culture, which may make it more susceptible to products like Slack.""

The interview

BUSINESS INSIDER NORDIC (BI): Talk about the market landscape. Who is your main competitor right now?

STEWART BUTTERFIELD (SB): ""Microsoft is the main competitor. They're the third largest company in the world and if they start channeling all [their] resources against you, that's a lot to compete with. So far, when companies have evaluated us head-to-head we've come out on top, but the competition keeps us hyper-focused on improving Slack.

By 2025 we expect the majority of communication to take place in channels; now that could be in Slack, or something similar. The biggest challenge we might face is if someone created a new Slack-like product that's even better. We don't anticipate that happening – we created the category and we have three years of feedback and data, three quarters of a million customer support tickets, and about the same number of tweets – which helped us build a beloved product with an emotionally invested fan-base, the likes of which has never been seen in enterprise software.

Right now, we are the best and we have a very strong momentum where everyone from enterprise software firms like Oracle and Salesforce to smaller app developers wants to work with us.""

BI: Are you at all worried that you will be the Snapchat to Microsoft's Instagram Stories, that they will copy you?

SB: ""That's a great question. If the question is just, how scared are you of competing with Microsoft because they have better distribution, that's a different question.

In the early 80s, no one would have expected that Microsoft would have ended up being a bigger company than IBM – it would have seemed ridiculous. But by the time IBM wanted to kill Microsoft it was too late.

Fast forward 15 years, and Microsoft sees Google that's got this great business and it's growing quickly: 'That's easy, we have 100 more engineers and money, we can build web search as well.' Then Microsoft throws everything they have at it and spends something like $20 billion over the next ten years, and then it completely failed.

It's not that Google is a one-off, because the same things happened with them with Facebook. They see that Facebook is getting very popular, there's a lot of potential there: 'We can make every YouTube user in the world use Google Plus, and use Gmail for distribution' — and still they fail.

The Instagram versus Snapchat is a different and slightly more interesting analogy.

Instagram has some features, but it's a very basic tool when you compare it to what Microsoft currently offers. In the Office365 bundle, you have Outlook and Exchange, which are obviously really important. Then you have MS Office, but also Yammer, Sharepoint, Skype for Business, Office365 Groups, and now Microsoft Teams. That's just very complicated.

Instagram however, is super fucking simple – the person controlling the software and using it is the same, so it's very easy to add one more thing. In contrast, Slack, and everything like it, works or doesn't at the level of the group.

You can't unilaterally decide you will use Slack to communicate with your colleagues. It's a critical transition. We found that if we don't get to 100% of people on a team, it just goes to zero. It doesn't have to be the whole company, but an organic unit. You have to get the whole group. In a world where there's already a bunch of sunk costs, it will be much more challenging to turn on Microsoft Teams, and hope that they adopt it, when they have that choice.

If you have a proposal you want to get feedback on, you can send it to people on Skype for Business, attach it to an email, put it in Sharepoint or use the comment streams in Yammer – and now Microsoft Teams. So it's a little bit of a bewildering choice and hard to know where the center of gravity is.""

BI: What about all the acquisition rumours swirling around. There was Amazon at one point?

SB: ""Many companies want to buy us, but we need a signal that someone wants to acquire us. It will not happen before we want it to. We definitely talk to all those big companies and have a great relationship with Google, Azure, and AWS at Amazon. For the same reason that it would make sense for a company to acquire us for a lot of money, it would make sense for us to stay independent. Because we think that the market potential is bigger than that.

The challenge for us is how well we execute on the strategic opportunity. We don't take any credit for this; I like to say that we discovered Slack, we didn't invent it. The potential is just huge. The fact how quickly we've grown over the past few years on the basis of the bottom-up demand is proof that the world wants this. There's all kinds of ways we can improve it, and features we can add. But the opportunity I think is at the same scale as Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, or whatever. We'll see if we can execute well enough on that.""

BI: Was there ever an eureka moment at Tiny Speck, the game company you were running before you spun off Slack? And can you talk about how the market has evolved since then?

SB: ""There was definitely an 'aha' moment when we first started – which was that we'll never work without a system like this again. The realization that it could be used for other teams was definitely an eureka moment.

What's interesting though is, when new employees start at Slack, I share with them the presentation that we gave to our investors before we started development. At the time, we thought that one day we could get to $100 million in revenue and that would be the end of it; like 10 or 15 years down the line, when we would have every single person who would want something like Slack. And we blew past that last year, and we're still growing incredibly quickly. So it's a lot bigger market than we thought at that time.

We didn't think about dentists using it, or police detectives using it to pass information to the next detective coming on shift about the case that they're investigating; we didn't think about people using it in the context of restaurants, or a million other things. We just thought of teams that were exactly like us.""

BI: Beyond benefits like channels and transparency, what else is there you think people should know about Slack?

SB: ""One unexpected bit of feedback is that people who are introverted enjoy using Slack. Sometimes they are excluded from participating, because they don't want to speak up in meetings. Maybe it's like a really fast-talking meeting where people are interrupting each other, so they prefer to take more time before they can formulate their thought before they communicate it. So they were just shut out and now they can participate. It wasn't anything that we planned for.

Second thing that's not obvious is that, over the last 20 years, in this world where software product categories keep proliferating, having one common network or thread that runs through the whole organization that can integrate with all of these services is a huge advantage. There are some 1,000 apps in Slack's app directory now. Also 150,000 developers, many of whom inside companies, developing internal integrations.

The other part is, Slack is not the end. We're still very much at the beginning of the evolution of how we best make use of electronic communication.""

BI: You started out mainly in the startup segment. However, you've moved into the corporate segment with more than 40% of Fortune 100 companies being paid subscribers of Slack. Are there any other sorts of businesses using Slack?

SB: ""We're gradually moving into business types that are further and further afield. One mistake and impression that people get, is that the way forward for Slack is just to move just to larger companies. There's definitely a lot of revenue in enterprise software concentrated in the head, versus the long tail. We've got 50,000 customer companies around the world, and some of them are the biggest companies in the world.

There are farms using Slack, there are federal governments in at least four countries. There's state municipal offices, dental offices, restaurants, police departments, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and so on.""

BI: Can you talk about the pros and cons of moving into enterprise, and becoming a competitor to Facebook and Microsoft?

SB: ""There's a different set of requirements, because it depends on the industry. There are a lot of regulatory and compliance-related issues, sometimes for just one customer, and also sometimes for a class of customers.

The process is a bit different for us than for many companies, which is: People just start using Slack, the company doesn't know, they love it, they get a lot of value out of it. Sometimes the user gets squished between us and procurement or IT or decision-making.

There's challenges in making the product work as elegantly for 10,000 people than it does for ten people – because we obviously had 10 people in mind when we first got started, so there's differences there. At the same time there's a lot that's coming – and it's sometimes harder on a bigger scale.""

JOHANN BUTTING (JB): ""The momentum that we have on the large enterprise side, when I joined the company earlier this year, that was for me the one really big surprise. Don't underestimate how far we already are in that process of moving into enterprise. Large enterprise is right now where it's really happening for us. That's just important to understand.""

BI: How is the uptake of Slack in the Nordics, and Sweden in particular?

SB: ""We have 3,000 companies in Sweden using Slack. Sweden's definitely number one in Europe – and could be number one in the world on a per capita basis. If you ask a dozen of Swedish startups if they use Slack, most of them will say yes. Sweden's use is probably comparable to San Francisco Bay area; in other words, 90 percent of the startups use Slack.

I think there's a predisposition towards the common good in Swedish culture, which may make it more susceptible to products like Slack. I think that would be very helpful, though I've never been to the country before – and have an outsider's perspective on the stereotypical Swedes.""

JB: ""If you took the Nordics as a whole it would be our second largest market in EMEA in terms of users and revenue. Sweden was certainly an early adopter of Slack in Europe, and as a result Sweden has the highest amount of Slack users per capita globally. But we've seen good adoption across the region from both startups and large enterprises, particularly in Finland.

For me it's no surprise that Nordic businesses are embracing Slack. Yes, the region has a strong track record for early adoption of technology, but the connection is stronger than that. It's about the strong team culture that characterises the region, and Slack just makes it easier for that culture to thrive and for those teams to get things done.""

BI: You're currently on tour in Sweden, one of the company's true believers. What do you think makes this market special?

JB: ""We have about 4% of Swedish knowledge workers using Slack on a weekly basis, and 90 percent of the Swedish startups. What we clearly see is that the usage in Sweden is more sophisticated, which is another indication that – whether it's cultural background, word of mouth, or a technically advanced society – it is being used more fully here than in other countries. We use Sweden as a blueprint and share those insights with the Brits, French, and Germans, because Sweden's really at the forefront in how Slack is being used in accelerating innovation."" BI: Slack is currently known as strictly an internal comms tool. Can it become relevant for external comms?

SB: ""I think it can. We just launched Shared Channels a couple of months ago, and the uptake has been fantastic. That will be an important thing for the future. But I don't see Slack transitioning into a principally external tool.

Realistically you work with a whole bunch of people on a regular basis who don't work for the same company. [...] The opportunity there for us is really enormous, and that will make one big plank of development. Allowing more than two organizations participate in a shared channels is an obvious one. [And] potentially moving more into helping the business relationships between those companies, whether that's invoicing, or secure transmittal of documents or payments or anything like that.""

BI: What's the one thing Stewart Butterfield does better than anybody else?

SB: ""Thoughtfulness. Doesn't mean I'm the nicest person to work with, but I understand the experience that someone has, and seek opportunities to improve that.

So if there's one thing, that's finding ways to make things simpler, more pleasant or more productive for other people. That's the mission of Slack.""

BI: Finally, do you ever pinch yourself at the journey you've had from zero to 5 billion?

SB: ""Every day. It all still seems unreal.

I've just been incredibly lucky, I think. It could be that today would have been an even better time to be born. But I just found myself in great circumstances along the way.""

Steve Kovach,The FCC will vote to repeal its net neutrality...,2017-12-10T13:30:00Z,business-insider,The FCC plans to repeal net neutrality this week — and it could ruin the internet,http://www.businessinsider.com/fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-will-lead-to-higher-prices-fewer-choices-2017-12,http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5a2b02a8a3b474a60a8b4cfd-1190-625/the-fcc-plans-to-repeal-net-neutrality-this-week--and-it-could-ruin-the-internet.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The FCC will vote to repeal its net neutrality rules on December 14. The outcome is a foregone conclusion.



The repeal of the rules likely won't mean broadband providers will block your access to Google or slow Netflix so it's unwatchable. But the move likely will mean the providers will charge internet companies tolls to be able to send their content or services to you.

Big companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix will be able to afford those tolls. But smaller internet companies could be boxed out.





It's inevitable — this week, the Federal Communications Commission will drive a stake in net neutrality.

On December 14, the agency will vote to repeal the net neutrality rules it put in place in 2015. With Republicans commissioners who oppose the rules outnumbering Democrats who favor them three to two, the outcome of the vote isn't in any doubt. Your protests and #netneutrality tweets will do nothing — this is really happening.

Assuming the move isn't blocked by the courts or overturned by Congress, it could radically reshape the internet by giving an already powerful group of telecommunications companies a great deal of control over what you can see and do online. It will also likely leave you with higher prices and fewer choices.

That's all great news for the telecommunications giants – but not so good for the rest of us.

It's all about the tolls

Net neutrality is the principal that internet service providers should, in general, treat all data sent over the network the same, no matter whether it's an email, an emoji sent over a chat service, a phone call, a political rant live-streamed by a college student from her parents' basement, or the latest show on Netflix. In particular, the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules bar ISPs from blocking, slowing, or providing preferential treatment to particular sites and services.

The battle over the FCC's rules comes amid a period of increasing consolidation among telecommunications and content companies. Comcast owns NBC Universal. AT&T is in a fight to buy Time Warner. Verizon owns AOL and Yahoo. Those companies already had immense power over how you connect to the internet. But they now also have a big stake in what you see and do online.

The repeal of net neutrality will give these giant companies free rein to favor their own sites, services, and content, and discriminate against those of rivals. As long as they tell you what they're doing, the government won't stand in their way.

I don't think this discrimination will come in the form of blocking or throttling access to rival sites, as some net neutrality supporters fear. Instead, I think the telecommunications companies will basically start charging new fees and tolls.

If you're a Comcast customer, you may have to pay extra to be able to stream video from Netflix or Amazon, rather than from NBC or Hulu, which Comcast part-owns. If you're a Verizon customer, you may get charged extra to access Google's news or finance sites rather than Yahoo's.

The rule-free environment the FCC is creating will give such companies the latitude to squeeze as much money as they can from you. The sky's the limit. And you can bet the companies will get creative. There's a reason nearly all of them are cheering net neutrality's demise, and it's not because they plan to save you money.

As a result, the internet will no longer be an open network. Instead, it'll be fractured and split into chunks. What you can access and see on the network will depend on what you're willing to pay.

It's bad for most internet companies except the giants

But the loss of net neutrality is not only going to mean higher prices, it's likely to mean less choice.

That's because it will allow broadband providers to impose new fees not just on you and me, but also on the internet companies that want to send their movies and websites our way. If Netflix wants to be able to stream ""Stranger Things"" to a Comcast customer, it will have to pay a toll to Comcast. If Spotify wants to be able to stream the latest hits to a Verizon customer, it will have to pay a toll to Verizon.

Such tolls will be a costly headache for Netflix, Spotify, Google, and the other big internet companies — but they won't be business breakers. Those companies generally have enough money at their disposal that they'll be able to pay whatever prices the telecommunications companies demand to ensure their customers can continue to access their sites and services.

But tolls could mean real trouble for those companies hoping to be the next Netflix, Amazon, or Google. Those startups could be hobbled by the charges — assuming they can afford to pay them at all.

The loss of net neutrality will mean fewer voices on the internet

One group of companies could be particularly affected by the repeal of the net neutrality rules — those that offer niche content. Such firms likely won't be able to afford the broadband providers' tolls and won't have the clout to broker deals, Aneesh Rajaram, the CEO of Vewd, which runs one of the largest smart TV app stores, warned in a conversation I had with him at Business Insider's IGNITION conference last month.

A company Rajaram knows that streams nature documentaries in ultra-high 4K resolution video is worried it won't be able to reach its customers if and when ISPs start imposing their tolls. If such companies are priced out of the market, more and more of the content available on the internet will come from the telecommunications and internet giants and you'll have access to fewer and fewer independent voices.

That might be OK if we weren't already seeing problems related to the dominance of just a few companies in the internet space, ranging from poor customer service and high prices in some cases to the widespread distribution of propaganda in last year's election. You can expect such matters to only get worse in a post-net neutrality world.

If we want to have any hope of addressing those and related problems, the internet has to remain open to companies that can take on the big incumbents.

Maybe the courts or Congress will do the right thing and overturn the FCC's effort to kill net neutrality. But in the meantime, the future of the internet looks pretty bleak.

Benjamin Zhang,Low-cost carriers accounted for 28% of all...,2017-12-10T13:57:00Z,business-insider,Major airlines are taking on the biggest threat to their business — and it's great for consumers,http://www.businessinsider.com/how-airlines-combat-low-cost-competition-2017-12,http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5a2b0bae8a4986b2088b4d2e-1190-625/major-airlines-are-taking-on-the-biggest-threat-to-their-business--and-its-great-for-consumers.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Low-cost carriers accounted for 28% of all passengers traffic in 2016. It's a percentage that's still growing.

The rise of low-cost carriers has disrupted an industry traditionally dominated by major legacy carriers.

These major airlines are now fighting back with low-cost options of their own.

The availability of more low-cost flights is ultimately better for the consumer.

Over the past two decades, low-cost carriers have turned the airline industry upside down. In 2016, the purveyors of cheap, no-frills flying accounted for 28% of all passenger traffic around the world. That's up 10% since 2014.

Low-cost airlines have transformed the way people fly in the developed world. But for many in the developing world, these airlines made commercial air travel an actual reality.

The effect low-cost carriers have had on modern society is tremendous. But one group that has been caught off guard is the legacy airlines that once operated with impunity around the world. For a big legacy airline, an upstart low-cost carrier is a small nuisance. But once that small nuisance grows in size and market power, low-cost carriers can hold tremendous pricing power. In that, they drive down fares. Great for consumers, but a real pain the in the butt for legacy airlines.

In the US, when Southwest Airlines, the world's largest LCC, enters a market fares drop. It's happened so many times there's even a name for it, ""The Southwest Effect.""

But beyond individual markets, LCCs have shown the ability to massively disrupt an entire continent. A great example of this is the rise of AirAsia. Commercial air travel in Southeast Asia has traditionally been dominated by a collection of large, well-respected legacy airlines like Singapore, Thai Airways, and Malaysia Airlines.

In 2001, a music industry executive named Tony Fernandes along with several others took control of AirAsia for $0.25 and an agreement to assume the airline's $11 million in debt. Over the past 16 years, the two-plane operation has grown to a fleet of more than 200 aircraft. In 2016, AirAsia accounted for 49% of commercial air travel in Malaysia. The airline also holds a 22% market share in Thailand.

""People didn't take us seriously and that was good because Malaysia Airlines thought 'Oh it's another stupid idea that'll die soon,'"" AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes told Business Insider. ""By the time they took us seriously we were too big and too popular.""

AirAsia is but one example of how a low-cost carrier can shake up the airline business. In Europe, LCCs now account for more than 40% of the airline market on the back of carriers such as Ryanair, EasyJet, and Norwegian.

""My personal view is that for especially the first decade of their existence, network carriers like ourselves sort of underestimated, ignored — almost arrogantly ignored — the rise of low-cost carriers,"" KLM Royal Dutch Airlines CEO Pieter Elbers told us. ""With that, we can see that their share in the European landscape has steadily increased and is now anywhere between 42% and 45% of all flights in Europe are with low-cost carriers, and a percentage which is significantly larger than in the US, where it's about a third.""

In response, KLM has made drastic changes to the way it conducts business.

""With that, we have embarked on a program in KLM a few years ago whereby we sort of said, 'We're going to defend our European network, and we're going to make sure that we do the right thing for our customers on the European network,'"" he said.

""So we have lowered our cost. We have increased our fleet utilization. We have changed our commercial offers on probably 60% of all our European destinations, which are about 80 destinations. We do have levels which are matching the low-cost carriers. So this combination of cost-cutting on the one-hand side, investing in our product and our service.""

Legacy airlines flight back

It's not just KLM that's making changes to account for low-cost competition.

In Europe, legacy airlines are fighting back by operating low-cost carriers of their own. KLM has Transavia while sister company Air France launched Joon earlier this month. According to Air France-KLM, Joon will not only be used as a counterpunch to low-cost carriers, it will serve as a testbed for new ideas that could help make the entire company more competitive in terms of costs, efficiency, and customer service.

In 2012, IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, took full control of Spanish low-cost airline Vueling, which services destinations across Europe. Earlier this year, IAG launched Level, a low-cost long-haul carrier designed to take on Norwegian and WOW.

Lufthansa, on the other hand, has been developing its Eurowings and Germanwings low-cost subsidiaries for the past 15 years.

Legacy airlines are also fighting back in Southeast Asia against the rise of AirAsia and others like Lion Air. Singapore Airlines created Budget Aviation Holdings to own and operate regional low-cost carrier Tigerair and long-haul LCC Scoot. According to Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong, separating the company's low-cost operation from the main airline, allows Scoot and Tigerair to create their own brand identities.

All of this is a boon for consumers. With iconic airlines like Singapore, Air France, and British Airways fighting for budget travelers, there are more options than ever for affordable flights. In fact, with LCCs in the market, even those who aren't shopping for ultra-cheap flights benefit from lower prices from greater competition.

US carriers take the basic economy route

In the US, American, Delta, and United are dealing with low-cost competition in a slightly different manner. America's big three tried and failed to launch their own LCCs. Delta's Song lasted only three years; from 2003 to 2006. While United's Ted managed to make it for five years before the financial crisis doomed the carrier in 2009.

Instead, America's legacy carriers have turned to basic economy fares to take on the likes of Spirit and Frontier.

So what does basic economy entail?

Basic economy is a discount fare class that exists within an airline's economy cabin. As a result, the in-flight service and experience will be the same for basic economy as it will be for someone who purchased a pricier main cabin economy ticket. This means passengers who go the basic economy route will sit in the same seats, enjoy the same in-flight perks and amenities as everyone else in coach.

But, there are restrictions placed upon the passengers prior to boarding the aircraft that separate basic economy from other fare classes. The most obvious restriction involves carry-on luggage. All three airlines allow basic economy passengers to bring on board one personal item/bag that will fit underneath the seat.

However, American and United prohibit any luggage that will require the use of an overhead bin. Delta's basic economy luggage policy is the same as its traditional main cabin which allows for a personal item as well as one complimentary carry-on bag.

Basic economy hasn't been as well received by consumers as dedicated LCCs with some referring to the fare as ""sub cattle class."" However, those unconcerned with the frivolities of main cabin air travel may still benefit from cheaper tickets.

As LCCs and legacy carriers dance their dance, consumers will continue to benefit from competition. With more than 7.5 billion people on Earth, there is still plenty of room for commercial aviation to grow. While markets in the US and Europe are fairly mature, there are still many areas of the world where air travel remains relatively underdeveloped and ripe for a well-run low-cost carrier to thrive.","lion air singapore airlines created budget aviation holdings

Bill Whitaker,"When it comes to climate change, California Governor Jerry Brown says President Trump doesn't have the fear of the wrath of God",2017-12-11T00:08:31+00:00,cbs-news,The governor who's castigating the president on climate change,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-governor-whos-castigating-the-president-on-climate-change/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/12/10/9f2d3858-8aa5-4044-bd9e-638ef0282453/brown.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Our country is divided between red states and blue states, a division that has intensified since the election of President Donald Trump. And some of the blue states are intensifying their resistance to the president. Most prominently, California, the country's bluest and most populous state, led by Governor Jerry Brown. Brown has been governor of California twice -- the first time, 40 years ago. He criticizes the president on taxes. California is suing the Trump administration over health care, immigration, and air quality, but nothing raises more righteous passion in Jerry Brown than the issue of climate change. He castigates the president for denying the science and aggravating a problem Governor Brown says is causing California to burn.

This is the most destructive fire season on record in California. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency this past week as raging wildfires, whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds and fueled by bone-dry brush, laid waste to tens-of-thousands of acres in Southern California. The smoke plume that shrouded the Los Angeles area could be seen from space. The fires that ravaged California's famed wine country in October were the deadliest the state has ever seen. Whole neighborhoods were incinerated. Dozens of people were killed.

Governor Jerry Brown: The fire season used to be a few months in the summer, now it's almost year-long. These fires are unprecedented. We've never seen anything like it. Scientists are telling us, ""This is the kind of stuff that's gonna happen."" And we gotta deal with it.

It's going to happen, he says, based on science that predicts extreme swings in weather patterns. This year, Southern California experienced record heat in October and November, creating the perfect conditions for this.

""I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed.""

Governor Jerry Brown: Nature is not a political game. Nature is the ground on which we stand, it's the air which we breathe. The truth of the case is that there's too much carbon being emitted, that heat-trapping gases are building up, the planet is warming and all hell is breaking loose.

Bill Whitaker: President Trump has famously called climate change -- a hoax. When he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord he said this wasn't a good deal for the United States.

Governor Jerry Brown: That's a preposterous idea not even a shred of truth in that statement. So I'd say to Mr. Trump, take a deeper look now is not the time to undo what every country in the world is committed to.

Bill Whitaker: Are you fearful?

Governor Jerry Brown: Oh yeah, you should, anyone who isn't is not looking at the facts. I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed.

If he sounds like a Jesuit seminarian, it's because he was one, years ago. Now, he's a climate missionary, traveling the world, preaching the gospel of renewable energy -- at the Vatican; in China, where President Xi Jinping discussed collaborating with California on cutting greenhouse gases. Brown went to the global climate summit in Bonn, Germany last month. He and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg led a delegation of mayors and legislators representing 40% of the U.S. economy. While the official U.S. delegation, sent by the White House, showed up to promote coal; Brown went to tell the world President Trump doesn't speak for all Americans.

Governor Jerry Brown: California is not waiting for Trump. We're not waiting for all the deniers.

He's already weaning California off fossil fuels. To give us a glimpse of the future, Brown took us to a 62-acre solar farm near Sacramento on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant.

CBS News

Bill Whitaker: You wanna have 50% of California's electricity generated by renewable sources by--

Governor Jerry Brown: By 2030.

Bill Whitaker: --2030. And you--

Governor Jerry Brown: And I think--

Bill Whitaker: --think you're gonna beat that?

Governor Jerry Brown: Yes, no question about it.

With the federal government standing down on climate action, California is blazing its own trail.

Bill Whitaker: What can you, the governor of one state in the United States, do to fill in the void?

Governor Jerry Brown: As governor of California we have a cap and trade system which is a very efficient way to reducing greenhouse gases. We have zero-emission vehicle mandate. We have efficiency standards for our buildings, for our appliances. So California is showing that dealing with climate is good for the economy, not bad.

""The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous.""

California is booming. Under Brown, it has grown from the 9th largest economy in the world to the 6th. It's now bigger than France with a budget surplus of more than $7 billion.

Bill Whitaker: When you first came into office this time. California faced more than $50 billion in debt and deficits. There were headlines that California was going to be the first ""failed state.""

Governor Jerry Brown: The fact is we cut the budget, we raised taxes and the economy roared back.

Bill Whitaker: You cut the budget. You raised taxes. These days that sounds like a prescription for political suicide?

Governor Jerry Brown: You gotta pay some taxes. You have to invest. We need to invest in the technology of tomorrow or somebody else will. And that somebody is China, India and other countries. You're not gonna poor mouth yourself to the future and roads cost money, that's called taxes. R&D cost money, colleges cost money -- schools, childcare, all of that. We're a rich country and we can handle it.

But California's economic success has come at a cost. Housing prices are through the roof. So are the ranks of the homeless. A quarter of the country's homeless live in California.

Governor Jerry Brown: This is not paradise. We have a lot of problems. But California is the engine of America, and I like to remind my fellow citizens when you kinda look askance at this state, you're looking at one of the, not the only one, but a major contributor to the well-being of the whole country.

California is vital to the national economy. That's why Brown is so angered by the new tax overhaul legislation being pushed by House and Senate Republicans. They call it a tax cut, but Brown says by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes it would actually increase the tax burden on high tax blue states like California. He and other blue state governors say the bill is retaliation against Trump's opponents. Brown called it evil and divisive.

Bill Whitaker: Do you think the Republicans are intentionally trying to punish the blue states that didn't vote for President Trump?

Governor Jerry Brown: I know this. The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous.

CBS News

But California Republicans say Brown's tax hikes are irresponsible. In Trump's America, Jerry Brown's California seems far out on the frontier. California doesn't look like the rest of the country: Minorities now are the majority of the population. It doesn't act like the rest of the country: The state voted to legalize recreational marijuana starting in January; will soon offer a third gender choice on drivers' licenses. Hillary Clinton trounced President Trump here by more than 4 million votes.

Bill Whitaker: It seems that California is way out of step with the rest of the country.

Governor Jerry Brown: I'd say we're more in tune with the future than many parts of the rest of the country.

Bill Whitaker: You think the country is going to look more like California in the future?

Governor Jerry Brown: I think it will. I was asking myself, ""Why did Democrats in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan, Pennsylvania, why'd they vote for Trump?"" Not a lot of 'em did, but enough to give him those states' electoral votes.

Bill Whitaker: And your answer?

Governor Jerry Brown: There's more confidence here; there's less fear. People are looking to the future. They're not scared, they're not going inward, they're not scapegoating, they're not blaming Mexican immigrants. They're not blaming the stranger. Just the opposite. It's is a place that's alive. It's dynamic. It's a culture that's on the move, not pulling up the drawbridge out of fear and and economic insecurity.

Jerry Brown is California's 39th and oldest governor. When he first held the office in 1975 he had a full head of hair. His father, Pat Brown had been governor eight years before. When you look at all the staid portraits of his predecessors in the capitol rotunda, it's obvious Jerry Brown is not like the others. Not many politicians spent four years in the seminary as Brown did in the 1950s. Or dated a rock star. He went out with Linda Rondstadt in the 70s.

Governor Jerry Brown: I've seen a lotta different things. I've worked with Mother Theresa. I've spent six months doing Zen meditation in Kamakura, Japan and I've run for President three times. I've done very incompatible things.

Bill Whitaker: People who like you will say that that's evidence of intellectual flexibility. People who don't like you say that that's evidence of your being flighty.

Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I'm not gonna -- that's that psycho babble.

Whatever you call it, his far-out politics his first time in office earned him the moniker Governor Moonbeam. We found him to be down to earth. He's California casual at the office. His dog Colusa has the run of the place.

Bill Whitaker: Are you better at being governor this time?

Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah, it's a different experience. 79 is not 36. Different ball game in every way. So I would say I know more, I understand more.

Bill Whitaker: What have you learned about yourself in those intervening years?

CBS News

Governor Jerry Brown: There's something you lose with age, your physical prowess -- but mental acuity and -- just life experience is very important. So, I enjoy the job a lot more.

It's hard to see why. His liberal policies make him a punching bag for conservatives and he's not universally loved by liberals. He's a political maverick. He's rolling back state union pensions. He refuses to curb oil production until there's a viable alternative. A majority of Californians like what he's doing. But he's been doing this for almost 50 years and he says it's time to hang up his political spurs. When he leaves office in January 2019, he swears he's going to leave elective politics behind.

Bill Whitaker: I think you're gonna miss this.

Governor Jerry Brown: No I won't.

Bill Whitaker: You don't think so?

Governor Jerry Brown: Next year I'll be 80, okay? And what do I want to do with my life? That's my question.

Bill Whitaker: What do you want to do?

Governor Jerry Brown: Well, I want to spend time with my wife.

A go it alone bachelor nearly all of his adult life, Jerry Brown now has a partner to share his life -- Anne Gust Brown, a former executive at The Gap. They married in 2005. Their plan is to retire to a ranch, in a golden valley north of Sacramento. They're building their dream ranch house - with solar panels, of course. It's off the grid and way off the beaten path.

The governor and Colusa, showed us around.

Bill Whitaker: This is beautiful governor. This is pretty steep.

Governor Jerry Brown: Oh you haven't seen nothing yet.

He told us he's going out at his peak, stepping away from the fray on land his great-grandfather settled in the 1860s. He said he intends to be a modest rancher. He's going to unplug and unwind.

Bill Whitaker: Do ya think this man sitting next to you is going to be content puttering around the ranch?

Governor Jerry Brown: I wouldn't call it ""puttering."" I don't ""putter.""

Anne Gust Brown: He sure doesn't putter. No--

Bill Whitaker: Running- - as he said, running a modest ranch.

Anne Gust Brown: We both wonder about it. 'Cause we've been running a hundred miles an hour and now we're gonna be in a place that's almost the opposite of that and we'll see.

Governor Jerry Brown: Yeah we're on the frontier, as it were.

Bill Whitaker: And you're going to like that?

Governor Jerry Brown: Well I like being on the frontier. That's for sure.

CBS News,"The Thomas Fire has scorched 173,000 acres and left more than 85,000 customers without power",2017-12-10T16:39:57+00:00,cbs-news,Raging Thomas Fire triggers new evacuation orders in California,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-thomas-fire-triggers-new-evacuation/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/12/10/0df19617-34ff-4efb-98a7-84e0da0b1369/wildfires.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"VENTURA -- The raging Thomas fire triggered new evacuation orders Sunday for the Ventura-Santa Barbara county lines, authorities said. Overnight, new orders were sent out for the Carpinteria and Montecito areas as one structure was lost, CBS Los Angeles reports.

Residents in areas north of Carpinteria from Toro Canyon Road east to the Santa Barbara County line and north of Highway 192 have been told to evacuate, as well as areas east of Buena Vista Drive to the county line and north of Highway 192.

Voluntary evacuation orders have been issued for areas east of San Ysidro to the county line, and south of Highway 192 to the ocean.

An evacuation shelter has been established at the UCSD Recreation Center at 516 Ocean Road, authorities said.

The fire, which has scorched 173,000 acres, has also interrupted transmission lines for the Santa Barbara area, leaving more than 85,000 customers without power.

The fire erupted seven days ago and resulted in 88,000 people having to evacuate throughout that time period.

""This fire literally started on the first day of our Santa Ana wind event, which it couldn't have started on a worse day,"" said Capt. Steve Kaufmann of the Ventura County Fire Department. ""Last night, because we're still under the Santa Ana wind event, the fire activity increased overnight.""

Kaufmann said the fire ""blew up"" very aggressively overnight into Santa Barbara County.

""If you're sitting on the 101 right now and you look up at the Camino Cielo ridgetop, you're going to be able to see fire that's crested the ridgetop that looks like it's heading down towards Montecito, Carpinteria, Summerland,"" he said.

An upwards of 4,000 firefighters have been deployed to the firefight.

""Please heed our warnings: the time for people to evacuate is not when we are trying to get our fire engines into the neighborhoods so if we do do an evacuation order, please make sure that you get out as soon as you can,"" he said.","ventura county fire department

Emily Tillett,"""I think it's a different situation if the allegations are not known, or if they occur while the person is sitting in the Senate,"" explained Collins on Sunday",2017-12-10T17:03:43+00:00,cbs-news,"If Moore is elected, Collins says senators will face ""tough decision"" on overturning Ala. voters",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/if-moore-is-elected-sen-collins-says-senators-will-face-tough-decision-on-overturning-ala-voters/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/12/10/5420fbcb-5779-4223-894b-aa1adb0cbf3a/ftn-collins2-121017.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, says lawmakers will face a ""tough decision"" regarding overturning ""the will of the people"" if Alabama Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore wins his state's special election this coming Tuesday in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct against him.

""If the allegations are known prior to the election, which they weren't in the case of Al Franken, for example, then we have a very tough decision to make about whether it's our role as senators to overturn the will of the people,"" Collins said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday.

""I think it's a different situation if the allegations are not known, or if they occur while the person is sitting in the Senate,"" she said.

Collins said she was ""disappointed"" in the Republican National Committee after it announced it would resume its financial support of Moore's campaign, something she says is a ""mistake.""

""I would point out that I did not support Mr. Moore even prior to these allegations of sexual misconduct because I was concerned about his anti-Muslim comments, his anti-LGBT comments, and also, most important of all, he'd been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for failure to follow lawful judicial orders,"" she added on Moore.

Collins' comments also come just one week after President Trump formally announced his full endorsement of Moore. He later held a rally in Florida aimed at Alabama voters, saying that the country ""can't afford"" to lose a Senate seat and have Democrat Doug Jones in the Senate.

In light of the RNC's renewed support of the embattled candidate, Collins maintains that ""Republicans care just as much as Democrats about sexual misconduct and sexual harassment.""

She called it a ""new awakening in our country"" after three lawmakers on Capitol Hill announced they would be stepping down in light of separate allegations of misconduct.

""This is pervasive, whether we're talking about Hollywood or Wall Street or the media, or Capitol Hill. And that's why I'm joining a bipartisan group of senators who are trying to look at our own procedures on Capitol Hill to assure that allegations of sexual misconduct involving members or staff are dealt with seriously,"" said Collins.

Meanwhile, Collins did not shed any light on where she stood on the Republican-led tax bill that now awaits conference to hash out any differences between the House and Senate bills, differences that Collins says in her eyes were ""major.""

""I don't know where the bill is going to come out. I also obviously care very much about amendments that I was successful in getting in the bill that particularly help middle income families,"" said Collins.","republican national committee

CBS News spoke with more than a dozen cadets, and four of them agreed to speak on camera to share their stories with Norah O'Donnell.

Two cadets who are currently enrolled at the Academy talk with O'Donnell in silhouette because they fear risking their careers by going public. Two former cadets, who left the Academy in 2013 -- after being sexually assaulted -- share their stories for the first time in an on-camera interview.

These cadets' accounts and the results of the investigation led by investigative producer Jennifer Janisch begin airing Monday, Dec. 11, on ""CBS This Morning.""

A preview aired Sunday night on ""CBS Evening News."" O'Donnell spoke with one cadet named Emily Hazen who described her encounter.

""I was sexually assaulted my freshman year and I did an administrative turn back for a semester and the sexual harassment I endured eventually made me leave,"" Hazen said. ""My perpetrator would follow me on runs. He would ... tell me he urinated on my car. He would write crude things on my car, like, in the fog. He would send me horrible text messages. He would stalk me, he would ask me where I was going in my little brown dress.""

O'Donnell asked if this man was ever reprimanded in any way?

""He was talked to by his commander about a very crude text message I received and told that that was unbecoming of an officer,"" Hazen said.

That cadet ended up graduating; Hazen left the Academy.

CBS News

Tuesday's ""CBS This Morning"" will feature the first television interview with Teresa Beasley, who worked for a decade as the Air Force Academy's top official on sexual assault prevention and response. Beasley tells O'Donnell she has serious concerns about how the Academy accounts for sexual assaults and says commanders are not supportive of those who file complaints.

Beasley also reveals -- and CBS News confirms -- previously undisclosed details about two violent attacks on cadets that occurred on a public trail behind the Air Force Academy in Dec. 2014 and Jan. 2015.

Also Tuesday, the Air Force Academy's Superintendent, Major General Jay Silveria is scheduled to join the broadcast live in-studio.

Emily Tillett,"When asked what she thinks of the ""cultural shift going on in America right now,"" Haley said she is ""incredibly proud of the women who have come forward""",2017-12-10T15:22:32+00:00,cbs-news,"Nikki Haley on Trump accusers: Women who accuse anyone ""should be heard"" and ""dealt with""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-on-trump-accusers-women-who-accuse-anyone-should-be-heard-and-dealt-with/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/09/04/22fce103-b70b-4e64-bd95-73b6205c169e/nikki-haley-unsc.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Sunday, in light of a growing number of probes into sexual misconduct against lawmakers, that ""the time has come"" to start bringing ""a conscience"" to the situation surrounding the treatment of women in the workplace as well as on Capitol Hill.

When asked what she thinks of the ""cultural shift"" taking place in the U.S., Haley said she is ""incredibly proud of the women who have come forward.""

""I'm proud of their strength. I'm proud of their courage,"" Haley said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""

Haley's comments came after three lawmakers in one week, including Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan and Rep. Trent Franks, R-Arizona, announced they would step down from office following allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment.

When asked to assess similar allegations of misconduct leveled against President Trump during the 2016 campaign, Haley replied, ""Women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with.""

""I think we heard from them prior to the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up,"" she added.

Meanwhile, Haley applauded the president's move in announcing the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel -- a controversial move that has ignited protests in the Middle East.

She told CBS News' John Dickerson that Mr. Trump's announcement on Wednesday was ""the right thing to do.""

""It is absolutely the right thing to do. And look, for the last 22 years, everyone around every president has said, 'Just wait, just wait, just wait.' And President Trump's not going to wait anymore,"" said Haley, calling the president's decision a ""courageous"" one.

When asked if Mr. Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital and begin the early stages of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to the city would further inflame tensions and disrupt work on the peace process, Haley said, ""I think that when you recognize the truth, when both parties recognize reality, peace comes.""

""If you notice when the president spoke, he made it very clear. He didn't talk about boundaries. He didn't talk about borders. He didn't get into any of that because the final status of Jerusalem is between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It's not for the Americans to decide.""

She added, ""The sky is not falling. If anything, what we're going to see is both sides are going to come to the table. They're going to decide what they think Jerusalem should look like. And we're going to support that process.""

While the latest move by the administration may impact the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, as Vice President Mike Pence prepares to visit the Middle East, Haley maintains that ""both sides"" will come to table and ""decide what they think Jerusalem should look like.""

""What he did was take it off the table. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Take that off the table. Tell both sides to come together and say, 'Okay, you decide how you want to split up Jerusalem. You decide if you're going to create boundaries or borders there.' And let them decide,"" said Haley.

To critics of the president's plan, Haley says the decision ""will go down in history to show he made the move that finally got the two parties to come to the table.""","united nations nikki haley

Mei Rui said she was flying to New York on Friday to participate in a cancer research study. She filmed the incident, and said before the cabin door was closed, she started breastfeeding. Flight attendants told her to stop and put the child into his seat, but Mei said she asked for a few minutes to finish to prevent her son from waking up.

Cellphone footage shows her son in his seat crying when another flight attendant instructs them to leave the plane. ""You just don't have to treat people that way. He was making very loud noises, but that's not criminal,"" Mei said.

In a statement, Spirit Airlines stood by its flight attendants' decision to remove the family from the flight.

""Our records indicate a passenger was removed from Flight 712 after refusing to comply with crew instructions several times during taxi to runway and safety briefing,"" the statement said. ""To protect the safety of our guests and crew, FAA regulations and airline policies require all passengers to stay seated and buckled during takeoff and landing.""

Mei received a full refund but told KHOU that she won't be flying with Spirit Airlines again.

""It was humiliating to be chased off a plane in front of hundreds of people. We had never been through anything close to this,"" Mei said. ""We're not lawbreakers or trouble seekers.

AP,State officeholders who said they intended to vote for Moore often cited the need to keep the seat in Republican hands,2017-12-10T17:39:36+00:00,cbs-news,Most Alabama GOP leaders say they are voting for Roy Moore,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-alabama-gop-leaders-say-they-are-voting-for-roy-moore/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/16/d1a5f880-4b19-4c63-af60-ed5f134987cb/gettyimages-874297046-2.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Most Republican leaders in Alabama say they plan to vote for Roy Moore on Tuesday despite sexual misconduct allegations against the former judge that have prompted others around the country to say he should never be allowed to join the U.S. Senate.

Sen. Richard Shelby is an exception — he said Sunday that the ""tipping point"" in his decision to cast a write-in ballot rather than vote for Moore or Democrat Doug Jones was an allegation that Moore molested a 14-year-old girl decades ago.

But Shelby's outspokenness against a man who could become his colleague was the exception rather than the rule.

""I have stated both publicly and privately over the last month that unless these allegations were proven to be true I would continue to plan to vote for the Republican nominee, Judge Roy Moore,"" Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill wrote in a text message to The Associated Press. ""I have already cast my absentee ballot and I voted for Judge Moore.""

The accusations against Moore have left many GOP voters and leaders in a quandary. Voters face the decision of whether to vote for Moore, accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers decades ago when he was a county prosecutor, or sending Jones to Washington, which would narrow the GOP's already precarious majority in the Senate.

They also could write in a name on their ballots or simply stay home. Meanwhile, most GOP politicians in the state must run for re-election next year — where they will face Moore's enthusiastic voting base at the polls.

The AP tried to find out how Republican leaders from Alabama plan to vote. Most officeholders or their staffs responded, while others have publicly stated their plans during public appearances or to other media outlets.

However, several officeholders did not respond to calls, emails or texts from the AP. They include U.S. Reps. Martha Roby, Mike Rogers and Gary Palmer, as well as state Treasurer Young Boozer and state House Speaker Mac McCutcheon.

State officeholders who said they intended to vote for Moore often cited the need to keep the seat in Republican hands.

In addition to Merrill, others who plan to vote for Moore include Gov. Kay Ivey; Attorney General Steve Marshall; state Auditor Jim Zeigler; Agriculture Commissioner John McMillan; state Senate President Pro Tempore Del Marsh; and Public Service Commissioner Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, who previously led the state GOP. Also voting for Moore are current state party head Terry Lathan and U.S. Reps. Mo Brooks of Huntsville and Robert Aderholt of Haleyville.

The state's most influential politician, Shelby has said he wrote in a ""distinguished Republican"" on his absentee ballot rather than vote for Moore.

Shelby told CNN on Sunday he had to vote Republican as a party officeholder, but he was swayed by a woman's claims that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 14.

""There's a lot of smoke,"" said Shelby. ""Got to be some fire somewhere.""

Shelby's decision has played prominently in Jones ads pointing out Republicans who are not voting for their party's nominee.

CNN reported last month that U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne said he will vote Republican and that he does not cast write-in votes. In a statement to the AP, Byrne said it is up to voters to decide.

""Some serious allegations have been made and Judge Moore has vehemently denied them. Frankly, I don't think the people of Alabama want me, any national politician, or the national news media telling them what to think or how to vote,"" Byrne said in the statement. ""The decision is ultimately up to the people of Alabama to evaluate the information they have before them and make an informed decision. We must respect the voters' decision.""

Sen. Luther Strange, who lost to Moore in the Republican primary, did not respond to a request for comment from AP, but told The Washington Post recently that the election is up to voters.

""I'm staying out of it now. I think everybody knows how I feel about Judge Moore. We made our case and the voters made a different decision,"" Strange told the newspaper in a video on its website.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who resigned from the Senate to join the Trump administration, declined to say how he would vote. Moore and Jones are competing for his old job.

""There have been some ads that may have suggested I endorsed a candidate, that is not so,"" Sessions said. ""I believe that the people of Alabama will make their own decision.""

State party loyalty rules could prohibit a GOP politician, or someone who aspires to be one, from publicly backing Moore's opponent. The rule says anyone who openly supports another party's nominee over a Republican could be barred from running as a Republican in the future.

Ivey became governor earlier this year after Robert Bentley resigned amid a sex scandal involving a much younger female political aide. When reached by the AP, Bentley declined to say who he is voting for Tuesday.

Ivey said last month that she has no reason to disbelieve the women who have accused Moore and is bothered by their allegations. But Ivey, who plans to run for governor in 2018, said she will vote for Moore anyway for the sake of GOP power in Congress. Her office did not respond to a request for an updated comment.","martha roby mike rogers

The agency's Metro Detroit post says a woman recently reported that her car was hit by gunfire on Thursday along Interstate 94 on the city's east side. Police say the gunfire occurred on the same day and in the same area as three other shootings.

One of the shootings along I-94 left a driver with a leg wound. Three other vehicles were struck but drivers weren't injured.

None of the first three victims appear to know each other, so investigators do believe the shootings are random, CBS Detroit reports.

It was unknown as of Saturday night if the fourth victim knows any of the other victims, the station reported.

Police said they're looking for a silver or gray sedan seen at some of the shootings. Extra police patrols have been added to area freeways.","agencys metro detroit post

Birmingham, London Stansted and London Luton airports briefly suspended flights as runways were cleared. The airports advised passengers to contact their airlines to check the status of flights.

Heathrow Airport just outside London, the busiest airport in Europe, expressed regret that weather conditions in the U.K. resulted in disruptions for passengers.

BBC reporter Matt Cole was stuck on his plane for 4.5 hours after his plane landed on the tarmac at Heathrow from Dublin. ""I am now stuck in baggage hall hell.There is information to say where bags are and the baggage office counter is apparently closed. A recently landed pilot says my bags are somewhere amidst 19,000 on carousels,"" Cole said.

Airports worked through the early evening to clear the backlog of flights. But in the world of interconnected air travel, the effects of any extended disruptions can persist for hours, with planes and flight crews quickly knocked out of rotation for their next assignments.

""Airlines are responsible for ensuring their flights are fully de-iced before they are operated, and this is resulting in some delays and cancellations,"" Heathrow Airport said in a statement posted on Twitter.

Weather-related troubles were also evident on U.K. roads. Police advised people to stay home unless travel was critical.

The M1 motorway -- the main highway between London and northeast England -- was partially closed in Leicestershire.

Police in Wales warned against all but the most essential travel amid persistent snowfall that was forecast to last throughout Sunday. Strong winds slammed the Welsh coast. The Met Office warned of wind and rain for London and southern England, with gusts of up to 70 mph predicted.","birmingham london stansted

Fred Imbert,"Bitcoin futures set to begin trading at the Cboe Futures Exchange on Sunday, following a huge ramp-up in the digital currency's price.",2017-12-10T22:00:40Z,cnbc,Bitcoin futures set to trade on CBOE Sunday evening after a wild surge for the cryptocurrency,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/10/bitcoin-futures-set-to-trade-on-cboe-sunday-evening.html,https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/12/08/104888290-GettyImages-494697042-cboe.1910x1000.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Bitcoin prices jumped on Sunday evening right as the Cboe Futures Exchange began trading futures on the cryptocurrency.

The digital currency was at $14,890 right at 6 p.m. New York time and then surged about $600 to $15,500.13 as of 7:17 p.m. on the Coinbase exchange.

The new futures were up 2.6 percent to $15,860 on the Cboe in very early trading. They also turned negative for a brief moment at about 6:55 p.m. New York time before bouncing back.The exchange launched the futures under the 'XBT' ticker symbol following a huge ramp-up in the digital currency's price this year.

""So far, trading has been smooth. I think that was the biggest worry for people"" heading into the launch, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""We've been trading for about an hour and more than 700 contracts have been traded. So, I'd say this is a successful launch.""

Interest was so great in the new product, it appeared to be overloading Cboe's website. ""Due to heavy traffic on our website, visitors to http://www.cboe.com may find that it is performing slower than usual and may at times be temporarily unavailable,"" the exchange said in a statement. ""All trading systems are operating normally.""

The launch lets institutional investors buy into the cryptocurrency space. Until now, bitcoin has been mostly owned and traded by a few entrepreneurs.

But not everyone was ready to jump head first into the cryptocurrencies pool on Sunday. Andrew Keene, CEO of AlphaShark Trading, noted that trading volume on the futures was very low. Keene noted that the low volume could be a sign that traders want to see how the futures launch goes before trading them.

He also said that the bid-to-ask price spread was ""too wide"" for him to trade the futures right away. ""I can't trade a product when the spread is $120. If those spreads tighten up, then it will be much easier"" for people to trade. Keene noted that the low volume could be a sign that traders want to see how the futures launch goes before trading them.

Bitcoin has become immensely popular this year, sending its price through the roof. In 2017 alone, bitcoin has shot up more than 1,000 percent. In the past month, the cryptocurrency is up more than $8,000 to trade at $14,950.06 on the Coinbase exchange shortly before the beginning of futures trading Sunday. It briefly broke above $19,000 on that exchange Thursday, before retreating.

Bitcoin year to date

Source: CoinDesk

Cboe will base the price of bitcoin futures using the Gemini Trust Company, an exchange co-founded by the Winklevoss twins. One futures contract will be worth one bitcoin at the Cboe.

Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets in the world right now rising and falling more than 20 percent at times in the span of a day. On Thursday, for example, bitcoin hit a high of $19,340 before falling more than 20 percent from that level. Such volatile trading — along with cybersecurity concerns and an association with criminal activity — has raised skepticism from major Wall Street institutions.

But launching bitcoin futures at the Cboe — one of the largest exchanges in the world — gives the digital currency some legitimacy it in the eyes of institutional investors. Bitcoin will also get a second dose of legitimacy after the CME Group launches its own bitcoin futures a week later. One CME bitcoin futures contract will be worth five bitcoins.

""The introduction of derivatives provides the necessary market structure for institutions to allocate to crypto-currencies,"" which are short-term and long-term positives, according to Tom Lee, founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. He also notes derivatives are ""the first step to enable the creation of ETFs and other more liquid instruments.""","fundstrat global advisors

Bob Pisani,CNBC's Bob Pisani gets insight from traders in the new bitcoin futures.,2017-12-10T23:57:18Z,cnbc,Trader of the new bitcoin futures on the gain at the start: 'Just figuring out its sea legs',https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/10/trader-of-the-new-bitcoin-futures-on-the-gain-at-the-start-just-figuring-out-its-sea-legs.html,https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/11/13/104839137-GettyImages-872408878.1910x1000.jpg,business,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Trading in bitcoin futures has begun on the CBOE. The open has been quiet.

At 6:35 PM ET, 341 lots had traded, according to one market maker, with each lot representing one bitcoin. The last print was $16,000, which is a premium to the spot price on the Gemini exchange, which was $15,680.

Doug Cifu, CEO of Virtu, one of several market makers in the Cboe bitcoin futures, said he is posting bids and offers for the futures based on the spot price on the Gemini exchange. As the start of futures trading approached, the spot priced swung wildly.

Shortly before the start of futures trading, at 5:55 PM ET, the spot price on Gemini was $14,610. At 6:03 PM, three minutes after the start of futures trading, the price rocketed to $15,900.

Given the wild price swings in bitcoin—the price on the Gemini exchange has doubled in about a month—interest in bitcoin futures has been high. Whether the start of futures will reduce volatility in bitcoin is still unclear.

Cifu is not surprised by the relatively quiet start. ""It's a young market, just figuring out its sea legs. It will find its level, like every market does.""

Nor is it clear if futures trading will make bitcoin any more respectable. What is clear is that it is a further step toward (limited) regulation, and at least makes parts of the bitcoin universe more transparent.

""This is your first opportunity to take a bitcoin deriviative and put it on a centrally cleared exchange that has transparency,"" JJ Kinahan, Chief Derivatives Strategist at AmeriTrade, told me.

Cifu definitely believes more transparency will help: ""I would not have participated in this if it was not on a regulated exchange.""","gemini exchange

In a robocall advertisement released by the Moore campaign, Trump issued a passionate call for voters to ""get out and vote for Roy Moore. His vote is our Republican Senate and its needed.""

In recent days, Trump has slowly embraced the Alabama Republican in the wake of a blizzard of allegations of sexual improprieties.

With polls showing a tight race between Moore and Democratic challenger Doug Jones, the president also suggested Moore's candidacy was necessary to pass Trump's agenda in the Senate, where Republicans hold a razor-thin majority.

""I need Alabama to go vote for Roy Moore. It is so important. We're already making America great again,"" Trump's voice stated on the advertisement, as he attacked Moore's challenger as antithetical to GOP interests.

""I'm going to make America safer and stronger and better than ever before but we need that seat. We need Roy voting for us,"" Trump said, as he disparaged Jones as ""a puppet of [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer. And he will vote with Washington liberals every single time.""","advertisement

Pavlopoulo is currently studying for her second masters degree, hoping it will increase the chances of being employed in the sustainable environment sector. She recently got a job offer with a monthly salary of 1,000 euros ($1,178). Although she will accept, Pavlopoulo will have to continue living with her parents.

Unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular, remain one of the biggest struggles in Greece. In 2016, 47.3 percent of the Greek population aged below 25 was out of work. That's nearly half of the population and more than two times the average rate across the euro zone.

The one wish that teacher Stathis Nikitopoulos, 38, has for 2018 is for his friends and family, who work in the private sector, to worry less about potentially losing their jobs.

""I work in the public sector and I think I can feel safe about my job, because the previous government has already cut positions in the public sector,"" Nikitopoulos, who teaches physical education, told CNBC.

Tice, who's known for running the Prudent Bear Fund before selling it to Federated in 2008, predicts stocks could sharply rise again in 2018.

""There's potentially a 50 percent chance there will be a 25 percent rally,"" he said to CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" this week. ""The market is going up some more... People are still not talking at cocktail parties about the hot stocks,"" he said.

A 25 percent jump would take the Dow to over 30,400, a gain of more than 6000 points from current levels. Yet his bold forecast included a risk that's hard to ignore.

""[There's a] 25 percent chance that we can have a 50 percent decline,"" he warned. ""Longer-term, the market is going to suck.""

A 50 percent drop would slice the Dow to a little over 12,000, a level at which it hasn't traded since June 2012.

The odds are high a black swan event will hit stocks within the next year, according to Tice. He lists North Korea as the top threat to the rally.

Tice is also citing history as a reason to turn pessimistic. Based historical data from the Shiller price-earnings (PE) Ratio, he sees the next ten years' return for stocks being anemic.

Tice has made bearish calls like this in the past. He called for a 30 to 50 percent stock market pullback in 2012 and 2014, as well. He acknowledged the wrongness of those early calls, but stood by his prediction.

""I've been wrong a lot by being too early, and I know where this ends long-term. Longer term, I'm completely confident this market is going to be down a lot,"" he argued.

Tice is urging investors to dramatically cut their exposure to the stock market, and put at least 15 percent into gold.

""If you think you could be really smart, you think you could get out, you think you could play it for six or eight months, then I can't argue about you being in stocks,"" Tice said. ""It's still a greater fool theory bet. It's a bit of Ponzi investing type of bet. And, I think it's dangerous.""","shiller priceearnings pe

The bitcoin craze could pose a real risk to the broader market next year, Deutsche Bank warned last week, ahead of the cryptocurrency's launch on futures exchanges, scheduled to take place Sunday.



Torsten Slok, the firm's chief international economist, sent to clients a list of significant risks to the market in 2018. Included on that list: A crash in the price of bitcoin, higher inflation and the threat of North Korea.



Bitcoin has emerged as a financial phenomenon this year as the digital currency sees $1,000-plus swings within hours. At this juncture, as the cryptocurrency has advanced quadruple digits this year, Slok said the markets have not correctly priced in the broader impact bitcoin could potentially have.

Deutsche Bank's risks to the market in 2018

""It is something that I think financial markets so far have been discounting as a small issue,"" the economist said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" He said he worries about whether bitcoin and its wild price swings could become ""more systemic"" next year if the current trends continue.



""The worry, of course, that one can have is that it's catching on quite substantially. And of course with the speed with which prices are going up, then you do wonder where prices will be even by the end of 2017. But we do think that in 2018, this, of course, will continue to be a topic, and there are a number of questions that remain unanswered,"" Slok said.

While bitcoin has more than its share of true believers — many of whom have sent its price on a dizzying rally to around $19,000 just last week — the digital currency's volatility and lack of transparency has earned it a fair number of critics.

Last week, ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer likened bitcoin trading to ""an abstruse casino game that seems to have only winners and no losers. You've got to like that, right? I think, though, that could change,"" Cramer said.

Specifically, questions persist around regulation of the cryptocurrency and transparency in what exactly investors hold, according to Deutsche's Slok.



The cryptocurrency's price rose above $19,000 for the first time on Thursday before tumbling more than 20 percent, according to Coinbase data.



Its volatility could intensify in days ahead as exchanges prepare to launch bitcoin futures trading.

The United States and South Korea conducted large-scale military drills last week, which the North said made the outbreak of war ""an established fact.""

North Korea has fired missiles over Japan as it pursues nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. sanctions and international condemnation. On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States.

This week's exercises will be the sixth drills sharing information in tracking ballistic missiles among the three nations, the defense force said.

It did not say whether the controversial THAAD system would be involved. The installation of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea has angered China, which fears its powerful radar could look deep into China and threaten its own security.

North Korea's missile test last month prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea's leadership would be ""utterly destroyed"" if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests.

The United States has also pressured China and other nations to cut trade and diplomatic ties with North Korea, as part of international efforts to dry up Pyongyang's illegal cash flows that could fund its weapons programs.

On Sunday, South Korea said it would impose new unilateral sanctions on 20 institutions and a dozen individuals in North Korea, barring any financial transactions between those sanctioned and any South Koreans.

""This unilateral sanction will prevent illegal funds flowing to North Korea and contribute to reinforce international communities' sanctions against North Korea,"" South Korea's finance ministry said in a statement.

The move is largely symbolic as trade and financial exchanges between the two Koreas have been barred since May 2010 following the torpedoing of a South Korean warship, which the North denied.

North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, Japan and the United States and says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.","north korea south koreas finance ministry

The Nasdaq created jitters in the market about a week ago, after it underperformed the S&P 500 index by its widest margin over a five-day period since May 2009.

Investors had seen it as a warning sign that the rally could be over, but Hickey has an entirely different prediction.

""When the best-performing sector sees a major move like that, it tends to raise eyebrows. So, the question everyone wonders is – is this the beginning of the end for the growth trade?"" Hickey asked recently on CNBC's ""Futures Now.""

Hickey's answer is no. He referred to the situation as a ""temporary speed bump"" for tech stocks.

""When you look at these types of prior or similar occurrences, you see short-term underperformance by tech in the week, and maybe even over a month,"" he said. ""But over three and six months going back to [2009], tech rebounded and outperformed.""

The Nasdaq fell 0.60 percent the week ended Dec. 1. It failed to muster up enough momentum to go positive last week — sliding by a tenth of a percent.

The index has surged 27 percent so far this year. And the Nasdaq 100, which includes high-flying FANG stocks Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet, has rallied 30 percent.

Right now, the Nasdaq is trading a fraction of a percent away from its all-time high.

""There's nothing to tell us something different is going to happen this time. The market internals are holding up well,"" Hickey said.","underperformance

Recently, the largest U.S. mall owner, Simon Property Group, claimed a high-profile victory in court over Starbucks, which was planning to close 77 of its Teavana stores across Simon's properties. Starbucks previously announced this summer it was planning to shutter all Teavana locations by the spring of 2018, as they were dragging down Starbucks' overall financial performance.

However, an Indiana judge has ruled in Simon's favor, preventing the coffee giant from closing 77 doors or facilitating any ""going out of business"" or similar sales, court documents reviewed by CNBC showed.

The lease agreements Starbucks originally signed with Simon for the Teavana brand require the tenant to be ""open and operating during normal business hours."" Some of those 77 leases still extend for up to another decade.

""We are disappointed in the judge's ruling,"" a Starbucks spokeswoman told CNBC. ""Our focus continues to be on finding a resolution.""

Then, on Thursday, a Washington court issued a similar ruling against grocery chain Whole Foods, which recently shuttered one of its 365-branded locations in a Bellevue, Washington shopping center, giving that landlord and other surrounding tenants little-to-no notice.

The lease that Whole Foods signed with ""Bellevue Square LLC"" in 2015 required the grocery chain to carry on business ""without interruption"" for the first 10 years of the contract. But Whole Foods moved quickly in October to close down that 365 store, neglecting its obligations and citing ""site challenges"" and underperformance.","bellevue washington

Two on Mueller's team have been focused on for potential anti-Trump bias

Washington (CNN) Rep. Adam Schiff is dismissing the GOP's accusations of bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, saying they're partisan efforts to discredit the significance of the investigation's potential findings.

On CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, host Jake Tapper asked the California Democrat about the GOP's accusations of bias within the investigation into allegations of collusion by the Trump campaign in Russia's efforts to influence last year's election. Schiff, who serves as the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Republicans' criticisms are ""an effort to tear at the very idea that there is an objective truth.""

""(T)he intent here is not to do oversight,"" Schiff said. ""The intent here is nothing short of discrediting Mueller, then discrediting the Justice Department, then discrediting the FBI, then discrediting the judiciary, should the judiciary convict some of the people that Mueller has charged or may charge in the future.""

Several incidents within Mueller's team have sparked the GOP's criticism in recent weeks. Senior FBI agent Peter Strzok was removed from the Mueller investigation over the summer after an internal investigation found he sent messages that could be interpreted as showing political bias for Clinton and against Trump. Electronic records show that Strzok also changed a key phrase in former FBI Director James Comey's description of how former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton handled classified information, modifying draft language describing Clinton's actions from ""grossly negligent"" to ""extremely careless,"" according to US officials familiar with the matter.

According to government emails published by the conservative activist group Judicial Watch, another lawyer on the Mueller team, Andrew Weissmann, praised former acting Attorney General Sally Yates after her decision in January not to enforce the Trump administration's travel ban -- a move that led soon after to her firing by President Donald Trump . Weissman served under Yates as a top prosecutor in the Justice Department's criminal division at the time.","antitrump bias washington cnn

The FBI email from March bolsters the explanation by the Justice Department for why Sessions didn't disclose contacts with the Russian ambassador in his application for a US security clearance. When the omission of the foreign contacts on the form was first reported by CNN in May, the Justice Department said Sessions' office was advised by the FBI that he didn't need to disclose the meetings.

An FBI agent, whose name isn't made public in the document released by the bureau, was responding in March to a query from Sessions' assistant. The assistant sought confirmation of what she said was an earlier conversation on the matter. At the time, news of Sessions' Russian contacts had recently become public and prompted fierce political criticism.

The agent didn't recall the earlier conversation but affirmed that ""he was not required to list foreign government contacts while in official government business unless he developed personal relationships from such contacts.""

The agent sent an email to his supervisor describing the new inquiry from Sessions' assistant.

(CNN) Outrage! That's what we saw from some Fox News on-air personalities this past week. So why the Fox freak-out? Simple: Robert Mueller's investigation.

In response to the investigation heating up, Fox News gave us a synchronized display of the same talking points -- all designed to undermine Mueller and help Donald Trump. These Fox News personalities truly seem more outraged at Mueller than at the Russian government for attacking our democracy!

There was the captain of Trump's cheerleading squad, Sean Hannity, declaring on his Fox News TV show that Mueller and his team of investigators were an ""utter disgrace."" Hannity then amped up the hysterics by claiming that this investigation poses a ""direct threat to you, the American people, and our American republic,"" as he called for Mueller to resign.

Then there was Laura Ingraham, who said of the Mueller investigation : ""What a total travesty, they should all step aside ... including Bob Mueller.""

Lou Dobbs also partook in the attack-Mueller reindeer games on his Fox Business network show, proclaiming it was ""time to kill the investigation."" Dobbs then bizarrely added that ""the person who should be investigated is Barack Obama."" Why? According to Dobbs, because the Russian interference ""occurred under his administration."" Apparently he thinks that Obama helped Trump get elected so that Trump could try to dismantle every accomplishment of his presidency.

Fox's Gregg Jarrett deserves an award for his unique take on how to dump Mueller. He called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation because he had failed to disclose his own contacts with a Russian diplomat during his Senate confirmation process, to now "" un-recuse himself "" for the ""sole purpose"" of getting rid of ""partisans, including Robert Mueller.""

Even former Speaker of the House and Fox News political contributor Newt Gingrich, who had praised Mueller when he was first appointed in May as a ""superb choice"" whose reputation was ""impeccable for honesty and integrity,"" said on air this week that ""Mueller is corrupt. The senior FBI is corrupt.""

This was like an updated version of ""All the President's Men,"" as Fox News's on-air talent toed the party line in defense of the President.

The purported reason for much of Team Fox's outrage was because they had just learned that back in August, Mueller had removed an FBI agent, Peter Strzok, from his investigation, after finding out that Strzok and a colleague had exchanged messages that could be interpreted as pro-Hillary Clinton. This proved, as Hannity put it , that Muller and his colleagues are a ""partisan, extremely biased, hyperpartisan attack team.""

Never mind that Mueller himself was a registered Republican and that he had been appointed to head the FBI in 2001 by Republican President George W. Bush.

In reality, it was likely the recent guilty plea by Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI that has been scaring the bejesus out of these Mueller-bashers. All of a sudden, the prospect of Trump being implicated in this scandal -- or at least dogged by it for years to come -- got very real.

Presumably, the realpolitik goal of Trump's Fox News defenders is to undermine any findings by Mueller that could implicate Trump in wrongdoing. After all, impeachment is a political remedy, and with the GOP controlling the House of Representatives, where the impeachment process must start per the Constitution, Fox is doing its best to convince Republican voters that any anti-Trump conclusions by Mueller are biased and should be ignored -- and to relieve some of the pressure on Republican House members to impeach Trump, should things get to that point.

But while Fox may be able to convince its viewers to ignore Mueller, it won't be so easy to get those outside the Fox bubble to get on board. A recent Washington Post-ABC poll found that 58% of Americans approve of Mueller's handling of this investigation -- with only 28% disapproving.

Even 38% of Republicans approved of Mueller's handling of this investigation.

These numbers also spell trouble for Trump if he were to follow the advice of his Fox friends and fire Mueller. Dumping Mueller -- who has far higher approval ratings than Trump -- could translate into a bloodbath for Congressional Republicans come the 2018 midterm elections, as voters could use these elections to send a message to the President.

It's unsettling that some are more worked up about Mueller than the Russian government's attack on our election, our democracy. But at least we can rest easy knowing that, despite the Fox freak out, the Mueller investigation is continuing.","fox freakout simple robert muellers

"Andrew Kaczynski, CNN","Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore appeared on a conspiracy-driven radio show twice in 2011, where he told the hosts in an interview that getting rid of constitutional amendments after the Tenth Amendment would 'eliminate many problems' in the way the US government is structured.",2017-12-10T23:10:13Z,cnn,Roy Moore in 2011: Getting rid of amendments after 10th would 'eliminate many problems',http://us.cnn.com/2017/12/10/politics/kfile-roy-moore-aroostook-watchmen/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171113190204-02-roy-moore-1111-super-tease.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"(CNN) Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore appeared on a conspiracy-driven radio show twice in 2011, where he told the hosts in an interview that getting rid of constitutional amendments after the Tenth Amendment would 'eliminate many problems' in the way the US government is structured.

Alabama's special election for Senate, in which Moore is facing Democrat Doug Jones, will be held Tuesday. Moore's controversial views on a variety of subjects -- including homosexuality, Islam, and evolution -- have come into sharper focus in the final days of the campaign, even as Moore has had to deal with multiple accusations from women who say that he sexually assaulted or pursued relationships with them as teenagers when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied all allegations.

Moore also faced criticism for comments he made in September at a campaign rally. According to the Los Angeles Times, when asked by a black member of the audience when he thought the last time America was great, Moore answered, ""I think it was great at the time when families were united — even though we had slavery — they cared for one another. Our families were strong, our country had a direction.""

Moore made his comments about constitutional amendments in a June 2011 appearance on the ""Aroostook Watchmen"" show, which is hosted by Maine residents Jack McCarthy and Steve Martin . The hosts have argued that the US government is illegitimate and who have said that the September 11, 2001, attacks , the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, the Boston bombing, and other mass shootings and terrorist attacks are false flag attacks committed by the government. (False flag attacks refer to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.)

The hosts have also spread conspiracy theories about the raid that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden and have pushed the false claim that former President Barack Obama was not born in the US.

CNN's KFile obtained audio from Moore's two appearances on the show. In the same June episode, Moore invoked Adolf Hitler in a discussion about Obama's birth certificate. In a May 2011 episode, Moore told the two radio hosts, who have repeatedly rejected the official explanation for the 9/11 attacks, that he would be open to hearings looking into ""what really happened"" on that day.

In Moore's June appearance, one of the hosts says he would like to see an amendment that would void all the amendments after the Tenth.

""That would eliminate many problems,"" Moore replied. ""You know people don't understand how some of these amendments have completely tried to wreck the form of government that our forefathers intended.""

Moore cited the 17th Amendment, which calls for the direct election of senators by voters rather than state legislatures, as one he particularly found troublesome.

The host agreed with Moore, before turning his attention to the 14th Amendment, which was passed during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War and guaranteed citizenship and equal rights and protection to former slaves and has been used in landmark Supreme Court cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and Obergefell v. Hodges.

""People also don't understand, and being from the South I bet you get it, the 14th Amendment was only approved at the point of the gun,"" the host said.

""Yeah, it had very serious problems with its approval by the states,"" Moore replied. ""The danger in the 14th Amendment, which was to restrict, it has been a restriction on the states using the first Ten Amendments by and through the 14th Amendment. To restrict the states from doing something that the federal government was restricted from doing and allowing the federal government to do something which the first Ten Amendments prevented them from doing. If you understand the incorporation doctrine used by the courts and what it meant. You'd understand what I'm talking about.""

Moore explained further that the first ten amendments restricted the federal government in certain areas.

""For example, the right to keep and bear arms, the First Amendment, freedom of press liberty. Those various freedoms and restrictions have been imposed on the states through the 14th Amendment. And yet the federal government is violating just about every one of them saying that -- they don't they don't -- are not restrained by them.""

Besides the 14th and 17th Amendments, amendments adopted after the Bill of Rights include the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, the 15th Amendment which prohibited the federal and state governments from denying citizens the right to vote based on that person's ""race, color, or previous condition of servitude,"" and the 19th Amendment, which extended the right to vote to women.

Moore's campaign spokesman told CNN's KFile that Moore does not believe all amendments after the Tenth should be eliminated.

""Once again, the media is taking a discussion about the overall framework for the separation of powers as laid out in the constitution to twist Roy Moore's position on specific issues,"" Doster said in an emailed statement. ""Roy Moore does not now nor has he ever favored limiting an individual's right to vote, and as a judge, he was noted for his fairness and for being a champion of civil rights.

""Judge Moore has expressed concern, as many other conservatives have, that the historical trend since the ratification of the Bill of Rights has been for federal empowerment over state empowerment.""

In the same June episode, Moore invoked Adolf Hitler in a discussion about Obama's birth certificate. Moore has in the past repeatedly questioned Obama's citizenship.

""Now let me ask you a question. You think that Barry Soetoro -- oh I'm sorry, Barack Obama -- you think you could get the security clearance that you got,"" a host asked.

""Well, I don't know about that. I don't know. I haven't, I haven't explored that. But my personal opinion. My personal opinion --,"" Moore responded.

""I think his dog could get a security clearance easier, the dog's got papers,"" the host interjected.

""I know what you mean Jack,"" Moore said.

The host then said that when he was in the military, Obama's documentation would not suffice to get him on a submarine.

Moore responded, ""Well that's, that's a problem. You know Hitler once said, 'you tell a big enough lie long enough, people to believe it.' And that's that's the problem. We've got to look at simple facts of the case, and we need to recognize we need a new administration in Washington. And it just doesn't, based upon party, we need like people that uphold the Constitution not undermine it.""

In the May 2011 episode of Aroostook Watchmen, after one of the hosts asks Moore if he would be ""interested in new hearings into what really happened on 9/11,"" Moore replies, ""Well, I think they need to explore that, yes, but it's something that's already done and now we have to live with the consequences. But I know what you're talking about. If there's any new evidence, we always go back to the truth. If there's anything that's not been revealed, we need to know about it,"" he said.

""Excellent,"" the host responded.

Moore campaign spokesman Brett Doster told CNN that Moore ""believes that Islamic terrorists were responsible for the 9/11 attacks, has made rebuilding the military one of his key campaign purposes, and is the only Senate candidate with experience serving in a combat zone.""","cnn alabama republican senate

Shelby said he doesn't have a reason not to believe the allegations against Moore

Washington (CNN) Sen. Richard Shelby says he wants a Republican elected to the Senate on Tuesday to represent Alabama, but that he didn't vote for GOP candidate Roy Moore in the special election.

The Alabama Republican said he's already cast his ballot, and that he chose a write-in candidate.

""I'd rather see the Republican win, but I'd rather see a Republican write-in. I couldn't vote for Roy Moore. I didn't vote for Roy Moore,"" Shelby told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""

Moore has been accused of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. In some cases, the women who have come forward about the relationships have alleged sexual abuse or assault. Moore has denied all the allegations.

Shelby said in November that he would probably write-in a candidate instead of casting a vote for Moore.

Moore said in the interview that when he stated he had never met any of the women, he was referring to the ones who have accused him of sexual assault or molestation.

Google and Amazon only record what they need to. Plus, you've read 1984, watched Big Brother (and thought the contestants were nuts for being watched 24-7) and you think spying on people's everyday lives is generally bad.

And yet, look at us. We're marinating in surveillance tech. We carry an always-on combination tracker and eavesdropping device everywhere we go (a smartphone). We agonize over picking out the best smart home microphone-speaker combination. We snarf up the latest in connected appliances. We say ""yes"" to all the apps, and surf the web looking for deals like it's the pre-condom era of porn.

We know the connected devices, no matter how big the company they come from, are all bug-infested, insecure, preyed upon and riddled with shady backroom data deals. And yet.

And yet.

The trend toward in-home surveillance devices is only continuing, with this year's gift-giving aspirations. Here at Engadget, we're modeling the trend: decrying privacy invasions, yet playing with privacy fire, indulging our lust for convenience and futurism with all the sexy gadgets on our 2017 best-of gift list.

We want the Echo, the Google Home, a Sonos One and all the privacy-devouring spy tech we can cram into our voice-activated games console. I'm with you! Yet, I know better than to let companies spy on me! Give me a new MacBook, a Chomebook, an iPad or a Surface, damn the easily-hackable onboard cameras and microphones, full-speed ahead. I'd push grandpa into a mall fountain and jam his walker into Best Buy's revolving doors to get my hands on the hottest new tracking devices, the iPhone, a Pixel, a Galaxy.

And that's the thing: We all know the risks these days. It's not like 10 years ago when some of us were trying to raise the alarm about webcam hacking and data dealing, and everyone thought we were fringey conspiracy weirdos in tinfoil bras doing Flickr updates from our freaky internet-connected phones.

If anything, security and surveillance are even bigger concerns. Just in October, a woman's new webcam was taken over practically the minute she plugged it in. In a Facebook post, she described the incident, going on to film the camera's complete hijacking while in progress. But here's the thing: The story didn't surprise anyone and didn't compete with any headlines. We're all like, yeah, that's a thing that happens now, while in our heads we silently practice what we'll do when it happens to us.

I know what you were thinking when your eyes traveled the wish list above, with the Echos and the Homes and the highly desirable appliances that make Inspector Gadget's kit look like unimaginative stupidity. You're thinking, ""but Amazon will protect me from unlawful requests"" and ""Google Home wouldn't do that on purpose; it would harm consumer trust.""

And in the instances we know of, you'd be right. When a man was murdered in November 2015, Amazon initially refused to hand over its Alexa data from the scene of the crime when prosecutors demanded the records. The company said that Alexa's questions and answers are protected by the First a+Amendment and Amazon ""seeks to protect the privacy rights of its customers."" Amazon later relented and shared the data when the defendant, the Echo's owner, gave permission. That a hacker had fun turning the Echo into a wiretap did not endeavor to reassure.

And that whole thing where Google Home was recording everything just this last October, well, that was a ""bug."" Never mind that ""bug"" is Facebook's perennial catch-all term/excuse for getting caught doing something people don't like (and that's not a good look for anyone). Google said its little smart home speaker was having an ""issue"" that caused it ""to behave incorrectly."" That probably wasn't reassuring for journalist Artem Russakovskii, who discovered he was being recorded 24-7.

What can we do, but take Google and Amazon at their word? No one trusts these companies or their interests in serving us better ads or suggestions. They say they'll protect us, they're big companies and can afford to properly test everything, and they fix their mistakes when we find them.

Haven't we learned anything from dystopian books and films? How is this now aspirational? Or is it just that we're so miserable from politics that a little convenience-at-a-cost is our only salve to soothe our tortured souls?

Don't feel bad. Everyone's doing it, the gleeful self-surveillance. Even hackers, who know better than anyone, I can tell you that they're shopping for the same things and going home to strip down and roll in piles of connected crap like they hate privacy, too. We're all going to privacy hell together.

I'm sure it'll be fine. As long as we remember that it pays to be paranoid because we're all so depressed and angry at the state of the state that we deserve a little fluff, a little fun, a little convenience.

Facebook may be insidious, Apple might've conditioned us, and everyone with a stake in the surveillance pie has tried to soothe us. But we still need to cover our webcams, turn off geotagging, drill into settings to fight the data creeping and stay awake and alert to the ways that companies make us targets.

Take my advice for the holidays: Shop like no one's watching, but never forget that someone might be listening.

We take a closer look.,2017-12-08T19:15:00Z,engadget,Patreon’s fee change punishes supporters who make small pledges,https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/08/patreon-fee-change-will-hurt-small-contributions/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D4595%252C2953%252C0%252C0%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1028%26image_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252Fd4f48c3a3bba867535760fa05f02dd2e%252F205934803%252Fone-dollar-banknotes-are-arranged-for-a-photograph-in-tokyo-japan-on-picture-id843957734%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3D7c9ad3bd889317ce10e881d1fb4e9df9c7f53778&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=02b8168a0ad78dc12cc12a675ba90d68c3c82e6e,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"If you're unfamiliar with Patreon, it's a service that allows individual people to financially support creators, such as webcomics authors, writers, podcasters and YouTube stars. Rather than a service like PayPal or Venmo, which offers one-time payments, Patreon operates on a per-month basis. Supporters pledge a certain amount per month -- $1 is the minimum -- and their cards are automatically charged at the beginning of the month for the amount they've committed across the platform. And obviously Patreon takes a cut, which is how it makes money.

Until now, it's been a pretty simple, no-frills system that many people in creative fields have taken advantage of. Musician Amanda Palmer, podcaster Sam Harris, YouTube star Jackson Bird and comics creator Jon Rosenberg are just a few of the big names that use the service.

In the interest of full disclosure, I personally use Patreon to cover the expenses of a podcast I'm the cohost of, called Desi Geek Girls. We make a reasonable amount per month, but we certainly aren't dependent on it. That's not the case for many creators, who rely on the service to support themselves on a day-to-day basis, using the service to pay rent, purchase groceries and buy equipment and supplies for their creative endeavors.

This week, though, Patreon introduced new changes that turns all of this upside down. On Wednesday, the service sent an email to creators outlining changes to the fee structure of pledges. Rather than extracting a processing fee from the creator side, Patreon is going to start charging supporters extra. The new service fee is 2.9 percent plus 35 cents per pledge. It's effective on December 18th for new pledges and as of January 1st for existing ones. Additionally, patrons will now be charged individually on the date of their pledge anniversary, rather than in bulk at the beginning of the month.

Now, this may not seem like a lot, but from anecdotal and personal experience, $1 pledges make up the backbone of Patreon. Generally speaking, people have a limited amount they're able to pledge, and rather than send $10 to one thing, they will often send $1 to 10 different projects they want to support. This new fee structure will wreak havoc on that system. Every $1 pledge will cost patrons $1.38 under this new model. Small donors are, in essence, going to pay 38 percent more under this new system. This change incentivizes bigger individual pledges. One $10 pledge will now cost a supporter $10.64 per month, while ten $1 pledges will be $13.80. This change will gut the $1, and perhaps the $5, economy on Patreon.

After the backlash, Patreon updated its announcement post to address some of its users' concerns and explain the fee change further. The team claims that creators and patrons both found the old payments system incredibly confusing, which resulted in thousands of support tickets from confused customers. The fee structure was also unclear -- a 5 percent fee from Patreon, plus a processing fee that ranged from 2 percent to 10 percent from a third party. It's true that this updated model simplifies things. The issue is who is bearing the burden of these fees.

Patreon has positioned this change as a benefit to creators; their announcement email had the subject line ""Creators now take home exactly 95 percent."" When creators receive their pledges every month, there is always some variability in exactly how much makes it to their accounts because of Patreon's fees. Now, creators will receive 95 percent of what they're pledged; Patreon will take the other 5 percent, plus the service fee from patrons. While this ""streamlining"" of fees might make things more predictable, it's already having negative effects. The creator of the popular webcomic Questionable Content, Jeph Jacques, told Engadget that as of this morning, he's lost between 200 and 250 patrons, out of over 5,000. Meanwhile, comic creator Kate Leth told Engadget she's lost around 50 supporters, out of almost 1,500. The fee change went public yesterday, and hasn't even starting hitting people's wallets yet.

Patreon update: yes, the change matters to people pic.twitter.com/Yx6qfGW3Kd — Mikey Neumann (@mikeyface) December 8, 2017

It's not just about number of patrons, though. It's about percentages. Ryan North, the writer of Marvel's The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl and creator of the popular webcomic Dinosaur Comics, told Engadget that in November, he had 734 patrons (He has 687 at the time of this writing, for comparison). Fifty-three percent, or 392, were at $1 or less. An additional 278 are at the $3 level. That's a whopping 91 percent of North's supporters. This illustrates how important small donors are, and they already might be getting scared off.

Creators have asked Patreon if they can continue to bear the burden of the service fees. The answer has been a resounding ""no."" Everyone has to move to the new model, whether they like it or not, and for both creator and patron, it's not good for the bottom line. Patreon maintains that this fee change ""was never (and still isn't) about making more money for Patreon as a company."" While many users of the service have taken issue with that statement, positioning this as a cash grab, the fact is that Patreon is a company. It has the right to try and increase its revenue. But claiming that it's trying to do what's best for both creators and supporters, when both are vocal about how this change is harmful, is disingenuous, to say the least.","popular webcomic dinosaur

Edgar Alvarez,"Snapchat's original shows are key to its future, but just how viable are they? Nobody knows.",2017-12-08T16:00:00Z,engadget,Nobody knows if Snapchat shows are actually successful,https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/08/snapchat-shows/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F3cb4e82fe2b441af25a4f48bd4548b6f%2F205931896%2Ftvs-lede-3.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=801a635299754d9d1a4eb27d2fba8cabf95b1393,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Over the past few months, Snapchat has lined up a slew of TV networks to create exclusive content for its Shows platform, such as A+E Networks, Discovery, ESPN, NBCUniversal and Turner (owner of CNN, TBS and TNT). According to The Wall Street Journal, Snapchat is also in talks with CBS and Fox, two of the biggest players in the TV industry. It's an ambitious effort, and Snapchat appears confident that it has the perfect formula for viable mobile-first, short-form video programming.

NBCUniversal, which invested $500 million as part of Snap's IPO in May, was one of the first networks to put the potential of Snapchat Shows on display. The company, like many other traditional media outlets, craves the young demographic that live on Snapchat. Last July, NBCUniversal launched Stay Tuned, a twice-daily news show created from the ground up with Snapchat users in mind. The show features two- to five-minute episodes shot in portrait mode, the ideal format for watching on-the-go on a smartphone. It's complemented by bright, colorful imagery and large text overlays that are displayed as the host discusses the news of the day.

So far, NBCUniversal's bet seems to be paying off, with the network claiming the show has garnered more than 29 million viewers since its debut. That number, however, needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Snapchat does not disclose valuable metrics like user watch time and series retention stats, so it's hard to know what exactly qualifies as a ""viewer."" The company also doesn't disclose monthly active users, which is considered a key metric in determining user growth.

A spokesperson for Snapchat did not provide specific viewership numbers but did say that Stay Tuned has more than 4 million subscribers. That's rather small when you consider that Snapchat has 178 million daily active users. Snapchat told Engadget that networks find its platform appealing because they can connect with audiences different than those who watch traditional TV. According to Snap, more than 60 percent of the people who watch Stay Tuned are under 25 years old. And it's no secret that ""millennials"" are a highly coveted demographic, not just by media companies but fashion and tech brands, as well.

Stay Tuned on Snapchat.

ESPN, which is owned by Disney, is another network that recently launched a show on Snapchat. Last month, it announced a mobile-focused version of its flagship TV news program, SportsCenter, exclusively for Snapchat. It features many of the same traits seen on Stay Tuned: vertical scenes, large text overlays and GIFs. You'll also notice young hosts with upbeat personalities and casual outfits. ESPN and NBCUniversal are betting that they have a better chance connecting with Snapchat users than, say, 40- or 50-year-old anchors in suits.

An ESPN representative declined to share viewer stats for SportsCenter on Snapchat, citing Snap's reservation about releasing usage data to external parties. The spokesperson said numbers for the show are ""very promising"" since it launched last month, but noted that it's early and there's not enough data to quantify accurate regular behavior.","ae networks discovery espn nbcuniversal

""Without an open internet, the music industry wouldn't be where it is today.""

Smith runs the digital-marketing firm Overflow, whose client list includes Coca-Cola, T-Mobile and Universal Music Group. He realizes that many of the marketing tools he uses began life as dorm-room projects that were then uploaded to the internet -- like Facebook and Twitter. ""If the major media behemoths of the time could have paid the right people to restrict those platforms from getting where they are, they surely would have.""

Mayer Hawthorne

For Andrew ""Mayer Hawthorne"" Cohen, it's clear: ""I wouldn't have a career without net neutrality,"" he said. ""Reversing net neutrality gives already-dominant megacorporations like Apple, Ticketmaster, Live Nation, Clear Channel even more power to snuff out the little guy.""

Cohen is from Ann Arbor, Michigan, a city known for being a college town with a gigantic football stadium -- not launching recording careers. Had it not been for Soundcloud and Twitter, the chances of him making a living as a musician were slim. In 2005, Hawthorne moved to Los Angeles and started recording for legendary hip-hop label Stones Throw Records. ""Those startups introduced my independent music to new listeners around the world and circumvented the keymasters/traditional modes of discovery like terrestrial radio.""

Frustrated by a lack of attention for heavy metal in Michigan, Jen Lorenski launched MoshPitNation, an online network that connects Michigan metalheads with the music they love. Lorenski also works as a digital marketer and is one of the driving forces behind TaxFormGals, a women-owned small business that, as the name suggests, supplies other small businesses with necessary tax forms, among other services. ""The openness of the internet has been crucial for small businesses like mine,"" she said. ""If the costs of being online become too steep, I could see a point where other small businesses scale back their investment"" and cause her to lose money.

For Rob Sheridan, an open internet launched a career he never thought possible. But before he served as Nine Inch Nails' art director, he was ""tragically, indirectly"" responsible for what could be the internet's first meme: the dancing baby. You know, the creepy CGI infant that busted a groove across the screen on Ally McBeal. Sheridan discovered the image file back when he was scouring bulletin boards and Usenet groups as a teenager.

""I just found this file of a CGI baby dancing to music, and it had no context,"" he recalled. ""It was just creepy as fuck."" After putting it on his personal homepage, he'd started getting a lot of messages about it. So, he gave the animation its own website on a server owned by his locally owned dial-up ISP in Seattle. The rest is history. ""Before I know it, I'm getting contacted by USA Today to interview me about it because the baby had just been on Ally McBeal,"" he said. ""It's kind of my fault.""

Beyond working on websites starring disturbing infants, Sheridan had a fansite dedicated to NIN. Someone from the industrial band's camp stumbled upon it, reached out, and by the end of his first year of art school at Pratt, Sheridan was designing NIN's website. ""[Net neutrality] changed my entire career,"" he said. ""I don't know where I'd be because I didn't even finish college.""

What's worrisome about the upcoming deregulation is that no one really knows what will happen in its wake. When the government deregulated the airline industry in the '70s, the result was dramatically lower fares but also delayed flights and overbooked planes. In 2017, the list of companies that favor deregulation are almost exclusively ISPs, which makes sense because they stand to make more money.

Net neutrality is about fostering fair competition. A kid in Iowa has the same access to upload her latest mixtape to SoundCloud as an established artist, and the small business down the block doesn't have to worry about paying extra for the same level of service as a global conglomerate.

The FCC recently issued a ""myth vs. fact"" press release stating that deregulation will be a boon for small businesses and startups. ""They will continue to flourish with more opportunities to innovate once those regulations are repealed,"" it said. ""Companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter all started and experienced tremendous growth under the previous light-touch rules.""

Lorenski disagreed. She said if ISPs started giving preference to huge conglomerations, like TaxFormGals' direct competitor QuickBooks, she might need to change her business model.

""Anyone trying to spew some bullshit that this would benefit small businesses in any way is completely up their own ass,"" Sheridan admonished. ""Imagine if Target was able to pay Comcast money to have their website load 10 times faster than people who hadn't paid it.""

While you might not think of places like Reddit or Etsy as small businesses, they play host to countless creators and makers. Any change to how people access either site would cause serious ripple effects to the people who earn a living selling their stuff online.

You can't overstate how many small businesses and creators have benefited from net neutrality. And in turn, how much culture has benefited from them.","andrew mayer hawthorne cohen

James Hibberd,,2017-12-10T23:49:44Z,entertainment-weekly,Donald Trump reportedly watches up to 8 hours of TV every day,http://ew.com/tv/2017/12/10/trump-tv/,https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-622148822.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630,entertainment,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"According to a lengthy The New York Times report about President Donald Trump’s “hour-by-hour battle for self-preservation” as leader of the free world, the former host of The Apprentice spends a minimum of four hours watching television every day … and up to eight hours total, or what amounts to a standard workday for 40-hours per week employees.

The report cites people close to the president familiar with his daily routine.

As you might expect, Trump isn’t binging Stranger Things 2 or catching up on This Is Us, but rather watching cable news, with Fox News’ Fox & Friends being a particular favorite. He also occasionally “hate-watches” CNN “to get worked up,” according to the Times.

Trump reportedly had a 60-inch TV installed in his White House dining room to consume more shows. And like sitcom dads of yore, the president has a rule about nobody else touching the remote control — unless they’re “technical support staff” (the need for which is left unexplained).

Trump has previously stated he doesn’t watch as much TV as people think he does. “I do not watch much television,” he said last month. “I know they like to say — people that don’t know me — they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources — you know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don’t get to watch much television, primarily because of documents. I’m reading documents a lot.”","selfpreservation

We gave it an A+

Philip wakes up and, this seems perfectly in line with his personality, goes outside to put himself through a series of timed, vigorous exercises. (You can take the boy out of Gordonstoun, etc. etc.) But he’s pulled a muscle in his neck and it bothers him enough that he’s taken to see an osteopath named Stephen Ward. Ward apparently comes highly recommended by the likes of Winston Churchill and Duncan Sandys (what a pair!), and he quietly manipulates Philip’s neck while speaking in soothing tones about tension and emotional strain. The men figure out they know some people in common, and Ward talks about the house parties he throws. Philip’s eye is caught by a beautiful brunette in a picture frame on the mantle; her name is Christine, and Ward tells him that she’ll certainly be at the parties too. “I enjoy putting people together,” says Ward, and oh brother is that the truth.

PREVIOUSLY: The Crown recap: ‘Paterfamilias’

(We’ve hit the point in the episode when I first looked up the details of the Profumo affair — the scandal that propels the plot of this whole episode. I’ve been led to believe I’d know it all cold if I had grown up in England, but instead I am American and I have Wikipedia and let me tell you, it’s fascinating stuff and will help fill in any gaps of what exactly happened. You can read all about it here. )

There’s an investigation with the beautiful Christine — turns out she’s also been having relations with a soviet spy. Oh, and maybe John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War. Where did they meet? Stephen Ward’s house, naturally. There’s a photograph of a lanky, big-eared fellow with his back turned who sure looks familiar. Christine doesn’t say who he is. He’s labeled Mystery Man.

Prime Minister Macmillan has a man-to-man talk with Profumo. Profumo denies everything and Macmillan tells his wife later that he believes him. He tells her confidently he knows a face of a liar — remember he’s telling this to a woman who had another lover for decades. She nails it when she calls him an incredulous, trusting fool.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth has to do one of the more unpleasant parts of her job — dealing with the rest of the family complaining about Margaret. Turns out Mags is redoing her house and the banging and hammering is unbearable to Aunt Marina. Elizabeth assures her she’ll have a word with Margaret, and then, excitedly, meets with a doctor who tells her she is pregnant. Claire Foy is such a tremendous actress that you can see her flush prettily. But the joy is a little tempered by the fact that she has low iron levels and must take it easy during this pregnancy.

She goes off to tell her husband the good news but he’s nowhere. She’s informed by a rather snooty staff member that His Royal Highness is away for a house party for the weekend. “It’s Wednesday,” says the queen. Sigh.

Meanwhile things are closing in on Stephen Ward. We get a nifty piece of exposition as a reporter explains that Ward sang like an osteopathic canary — about the call girls and the Russian spy and Profumo. Profumo will be no doubt resigning any moment! Guess who he’s talking to? Hotter-than-hot Matthew Goode, a.k.a. Tony Snowdon, who is talking about going on assignment to Paris. We hear he’s just been in New York and Tokyo and shouldn’t he be spending more time at home? Nah, he says, his home is a construction site. Margaret is apparently pregnant again and Tony says it’s good to know what bonds a couple. For them, it’s absence. Oh, boy.

Elizabeth goes to see Margaret and it turns out that Tony is not wrong: There’s an awful lot of construction going on. Margaret, as usual, looks fabulous and not a second pregnant. There’s some chatter about how modern it is to have a dining room table near the kitchen and then the two sisters are sort of sweet with each other, discussing their respective pregnancies. Of course that sweetness does not last when Elizabeth tells Margaret to chill out on the noise. In fact, Margaret’s irritation may lead her to spitefully tell Elizabeth about a rumor they’ve heard: She shows Elizabeth the Mystery Man photo and is all — look like anyone we know? Elizabeth tries to keep her face neutral but it is a struggle.

This woman needs to rest, but there’s no time for that. Macmillan has come to see her and tell her he’s ready to resign. She’s like, Uh, no way, bro. She needs him to pull it together and lead the country. She needs to go Scotland (her safe place) to rest for the baby and he needs to step it up. She tells him it would mean a great deal to her personally. Then she rings her goodbye bell. God, I love her goodbye bell.

Macmillan is taking a drubbing from the public. His wife gleefully tells him all about how this satire group makes fun of him and how she laughed and laughed and laughed. I kind of hate her. I don’t love him either, but she seems just straight up mean. She tells him to go see for himself.

Philip packs more than anyone I’ve ever seen. Elizabeth goes to see him and for a hot second thinks the luggage means he’s coming with her to Scotland. Not a chance: He’s going to St. Moritz. “How mysterious,” she bites out. “You enjoy the mountains, dear.” Yeow.

We get a cross-cut between Elizabeth on the beautiful scenic train ride up to Scotland, pensively looking out the window. Macmillan has taken the masochistic path of seeing the show for himself and it’s just as bad as you might imagine. We also see a bit of Ward’s trial and of him sketching in a notebook. Things do not look great for him as we hear things like: “Men like Ward don’t deserve our pity, only our contempt…he is a thoroughly filthy fellow.” Before he can hear his verdict, he kills himself. While going through his things, they flip through his sketchpad and find a drawing of Philip. The plot thickens, does it not?

Earlier this weekend, a video started to make the rounds on Twitter of a boy from Knoxville, Tennessee, tearfully explaining that he’s being severely bullied at school.

“Why do they bully, what’s the point of it?” the boy, Keaton Jones, asks his mother as she’s filming. “People that are different don’t need to be criticized about it, it’s not their fault. But if you are made fun of, don’t let it bother you. stay strong, I guess. It’s hard. But, it’ll probably get better one day.”

On Sunday, Captain America and Avengers star Chris Evans caught wind of the video and offered his support to Keaton, as well as a ticket to the premiere of one of the most-anticipated films of 2018.

“Stay strong, Keaton. Don’t let them make you turn cold. I promise it gets better,” Evans tweeted. “While those punks at your school are deciding what kind of people they want to be in this world, how would you and your mom like to come to the Avengers premiere in LA next year?”

Avengers: Infinity War is due in theaters May 4. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige told Vanity Fair recently that the untitled fourth Avengers film set for 2019 is intended to be a “finale” for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it.

Several other celebrities sent similar messages of goodwill to Keaton, including Evans’ Avengers costar Mark Ruffalo, Star Wars icon Mark Hamill, and Stranger Things breakout Millie Bobby Brown. Check out some highlights below.

Shutterstock photographer Chelsea Lauren posted crowd-shot footage on Instagram in which her camera is struck by Homme’s foot. “It was obviously intentional,” Lauren said in an interview with Variety.

“I saw him coming over and I was shooting away,” she recalled. “The next thing I know his foot connects with my camera and my camera connects with my face, really hard. He looked straight at me, swung his leg back pretty hard and full-blown kicked me in the face. He continued performing, I was startled, I kind of stopped looking at him, I just got down and was holding my face because it hurt so badly.”

Lauren also said she went to the ER and plans to file a police report.

In a statement provided to EW by a representative Sunday, Homme said, “Last night, while in a state of being lost in performance, I kicked over various lighting and equipment on our stage. Today it was brought to my attention that this included a camera held by photographer Chelsea Lauren. I did not mean for that to happen and I am very sorry. I would never intentionally cause harm to anyone working at or attending one of our shows and I hope Chelsea will accept my sincere apology.”

In a follow-up Instagram post published before Homme’s statement, Lauren stressed that she holds Homme solely responsible for the incident and added, “Assault in any form is not okay, no matter what the reasoning. Alcohol and drugs are no excuse. I was where I was allowed to be, I was not breaking any rules. I was simply trying to do my job.”

Lauren also told Variety that Homme deliberately cut his forehead and dripped blood during his set, and that he insulted the sold-out crowd as well as headlining act Muse.","midperformance

type TV Show Current Status In Season seasons 1 run date 11/04/16 author Nancy Bilyeau broadcaster Netflix publisher Touchstone genre Drama

We gave it an A-

Hello, it’s Sara V, here, taking over for the final stretch. (True story: A category on Jeopardy last week was prime ministers during Queen Elizabeth’s reign, and I nailed it. Thank you, The Crown!). Anyway, let’s dig in: Were you thinking: Gee, the queen is fascinating to follow as a character and ruler but what I really would like is an episode just about the male members of the house? Well, then, you are in luck because this episode takes a long hard look at the inner workings of young Prince Charles and his father Philip — both as an adult and as a child. (I’m convinced — convinced — that this episode is some serious foreshadowing to three seasons from now when The Crown tackles the Diana years and her death. But I’m getting ahead of myself.)

PREVIOUSLY: The Crown recap: ‘Dear Mrs. Kennedy’

We begin with seeing that our young prince is struggling at school. Kids don’t seem to like him. The queen is told that other boys that age can be cruel. (Um, that age?) Charles is…different. He’s shy and sensitive and delicate. She’s advised that Eton is the right place to send him to school and you can see she’s relieved. She tells Charles — who is equally psyched — that he’ll be within sight of the castle and can come up the hill and sleep in his bed. They just need his father to sign off. Oh yeah, about that…

Charles writes to his uncle Dickie about how happy and relieved he is. Dick writes back — with a really sweet tone we’ve not really seen before — about how lucky Charles is. He takes Charles shopping and there’s a Pretty Woman-like montage straight out of Kingsman. The posh clothes make Charles stand just a little bit taller. He almost beams.

Philip comes bounding up the palace steps in good, long, athletic strides, a trophy cup in his hand. He and Elizabeth banter cutely about rich people sports and she tries to casually slide in the news that Charles is going to Eton. Over my dead body, Philip more or less says, in the kind of way that makes it clear there is no wiggle room. He later breaks the news to his son that his former school, Gordonstoun, is what made him the man he is today. (If Elizabeth sniffed somewhere off camera, we did not hear it.) He tells Charles that the palace life he’s in is not the real world and Charles must say goodbye to those nice clothes in exchange for some drab jumpers instead.

We have our first flashback to a young Philip — handsome, tall, pouty — and you can tell just by looking at him that this is a very different kind of kid than the one he will one day have. He’s in Germany — we can tell by all the Nazis standing around him — and he complains that he doesn’t want to go, doesn’t want to leave his beloved sister. His favorite sister. The best sister ever. (Got it? He loves this sister.) She’s going to fly him to school even though she hates flying so much she wears black in case it turns into her funeral. Inside the plane they hit some air and she freaks out — a lot of people are screaming in German which, I can tell you, is never ever calming — and Philip holds her hand. Turns out the reason he’s being sent to Scotland is because his father thought he should be educated by a genius, like Dr. Hahn. Of course Dr. Hahn is a Jew so couldn’t stay in German for obvious reasons. (Ugh.) As usual, the rich have very interesting logic when it comes to right and wrong and individual choices.

Philip flies Charles to school himself, quietly carrying on a tradition he doesn’t verbalize. Dr. Hahn is still there and is happy to see him. Philip is beaming as he booms out a cheery halllooo to the boys, and takes a deep, satisfied breath that the school is still so gray and cold. He tells Hahn he doesn’t want his son “mollycoddled” in some luxury hotel. (Mmmm, luxury hotel.) The boys have given Charles his father’s old bed by the window.

Back in England, Elizabeth watches the news covering Charles’s arrival and about how the school is famed for some TriWizard-like tournament. On the first night Charles discovers the bed by the window is actually the worst as he gets rained on all night and snapped at by the boys when he tries to stay dry.

We flash back to a morning when young Philip didn’t want to get out of that same bed. He complains about the cold and coughs in the damp Scottish air and runs in mud and, gotta say, I’m with the boys here — this looks real unfun. However, Philip’s stubborn streak is an impressive thing to behold. Even though he’s freezing, he shows those boys he can take whatever is dished out and stands under the ice cold shower with a look on his face like, How you like them royal apples? Charles may not have inherited this streak.

Yet Philip continues to resist the ways of the school, brooding by the window and refusing to do assigned tasks as he deems it beneath him as manual labor. Seems like we know who the real mollycoddled namby-pamby was, no? The other lads tease him, using some fun sharp barbs about his sisters being Nazis and the like. Philip fights one of them and gets tossed out the window. He arrives in Hahn’s office with a bloodied lip and a dark expression. Hahn, who seems like a good dude, tells Philip to think of this place as a haven away from the madness (good on him for not being like, Well your family DOES like Nazis and tossed me out of my own dang country). He tells Philip the world needs saviors.

Philip calls his sister and she’s sweet and tells him she’s expecting a baby and that he can come and spend the Christmas break with her. She then has to go back because the Nazis are partying. (Next: Charles and Philip each struggle)","individual choices philip flies charles

type TV Show Current Status In Season tvpgr TV-14 seasons 41 run date 10/11/75 Producer Lorne Michaels broadcaster NBC genre Comedy

We gave it a B-

James Franco hosted SNL for the fourth time on Saturday. Ostensibly the gig was meant to promote his new movie The Disaster Artist, about the making of so-bad-it’s-good cult classic The Room. But in a surprising development, The Disaster Artist was mentioned only once in the entire episode, and eccentric impresario Tommy Wiseau (whom Franco portrays in the film) went without a name-check. Instead, Franco relied on his tried-and-true method for comedy — namely, showing off his famous friends. Luckily, he got some major support from musical guest SZA, who put on one of the most electrifying SNL performances in a while.

Cold Open

Aside from SZA’s performances, this episode felt pretty half-assed. It all started with the cold open, which mostly consisted of a skit featuring Kenan Thompson as a department-store Santa Claus who has to fend off questions from curious kids about recent political news. In some ways I sympathize with SNL; the news cycle has now gone so far off the rails, it’s hard to expect them to come up with humorous commentary about the Alabama Senate race AND moving Israel’s capital to Jerusalem AND the opioid crisis AND the NFL kneeling protests AND the political fall of SNL veteran Al Franken. But even so, bringing out cute kids to basically just read a list of trending Twitter topics feels like the most low-hanging fruit possible.

Monologue

For those of you who haven’t seen it, The Disaster Artist is a hilarious look at how two clueless, talentless dreamers (played by the Franco brothers) ended up creating one of the worst films ever made. That’s an intrinsically funny story, but Franco pads it out further by casting almost every part with one of his celebrity friends. It’s hard to focus too much on the specifics of the underdog story when you’re constantly going, “Wow, there’s Seth Rogen! Wow, there’s Judd Apatow!”

Well, I must inform you that Franco adopted the exact same strategy for his SNL monologue this week. There were hardly any jokes to be found. Instead, Franco called on audience members for questions. Almost all of them turned out to be celebrities: Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, and Steve Martin all showed up. It was fine if you watch SNL just to see celebrities hang out, but surprisingly devoid of actual jokes.

Weekend Update

Even with the reference-filled open, there was still plenty of news to talk about when Weekend Update finally swung around. Colin Jost started things off talking about President Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and diagnosed it as a distraction from domestic issues. But things got more problematic after that.

As if the cold open wasn’t enough already, SNL also devoted a good amount of Weekend Update time to sticking up for former cast member Al Franken. Franken has been accused by several women of sexual misconduct, including unwanted groping. In the midst of the ongoing post-Weinstein #MeToo moment around sexual harassment, pressure built up from both Democratic voters and politicians for Franken to resign. On Thursday, Franken formally announced his plans to resign, making sure to complain that it was an unfair double standard that he was being forced out of politics while Republican politicians facing similar or worse accusations (such as Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and President Donald Trump himself) remain unpunished by their own party. It is certainly a shame that not all of Congress’ accused harassers are being punished, but SNL spending so much time trying to defend their friend is just not a good look.

But this Weekend Update session redeemed itself at the end with a skit about Michael Che going undercover as a white liberal woman named Gretchen. Che didn’t wear any “whiteface” makeup for his disguise, but he didn’t need to. As it turns out, all you need to do to hide among liberal white women is pretend to have a needlessly thoughtful opinion about Cardi B.

Best Sketch: Za

Thanks to the popularity of recent O.J. Simpson retrospectives, there have been a lot of pop culture riffs on court cases recently. The premise of this sketch is deceptively simple (Franco plays an attorney trying to catch a client by proving that he meant “lasagna,” not “pizza,” when he said “za”) but manages to put a new twist on court dynamics thanks to Franco’s extravagant graphs about the exact pronunciation of “za.” Like The Room, it’s so stupid it’s actually really funny.

Worst Sketch: “Gift Wrap”

It’s always a bad sign for an SNL episode when an early skit goes on way too long. Franco played a stubborn gift-wrapper in one of the show’s early segments, but it only had one joke (he refuses to treat his bleeding extremities as he works himself slowly to death) repeated over and over.

Most Expected Cameo: “Reunion”

There was no Tommy Wiseau appearance here, but one of Franco’s The Disaster Artist co-stars did show up: his brother Dave! And in a sketch about an awkward family reunion, no less.

Best of SZA: “The Weekend”

Franco’s humor was relatively shallow this episode, but his saving grace was being paired with SZA. The young R&B musician’s Ctrl is one of the best albums of the year, and SZA capably amplified the songs for the live SNL setting. “The Weekend,” for instance, came complete with a new flute intro and backing choir. It was hard to watch the performance in anything but stunned silence.

Cast MVP: Pete Davidson

On the sketches where Franco did unleash his eccentric humor, Davidson was around to play a capable straight man. Whether it was the defendant in the “za” court case or a spelling bee contestant helplessly asking for a normal word from Franco’s disturbed moderator (and getting “littlepigboy” in response), Davidson was able to balance out Franco’s wackiness.","seth rogen jonah hill

In Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, the answer for most people is: Not the real one.

Life is miserable. Poverty is rampant. The only escape is a virtual-reality simulation called the OASIS that is steeped in pop-culture from the 1980s.

Even the new trailer just hints at the toy box full of familiar characters and vehicles in this movie, out in March 2018.

“There are so many more compelling reasons to escape into the OASIS than exist in real life,” Spielberg tells EW about his dystopian adventure, which is based on the 2011 novel by Ernest Cline.

“A lot of our movie is a comparative study,” the director adds. “Which world would they rather spend their lives in — with all the distractions and complexities and perks of the digital world of the OASIS, or with the responsibilities of being a student or a parent living in real life? It’s real life versus virtual life. Which is more compelling?”

But those worlds are both at risk when the creator of the OASIS dies and leaves behind a puzzle that will decide ownership of these technological wonders.

Where they’re going, to steal a line from one iconic ’80s movie being referenced, they don’t need roads.

There’s more to come, as EW will dive into the trailer to decode some of its references and secrets.","responsibilities

With all the major studios forgoing new wide releases for the second week in a row, Disney and Pixar’s Day of the Dead-themed animated musical is set to top the box office for a third consecutive weekend, grossing an estimated $18.3 million in 3,748 theaters in the U.S. and Canada.

That would bring Coco’s domestic total to $135.5 million after 19 days in theaters, while an estimated $55.3 million from foreign markets this weekend would push its international total to $254 million (for a worldwide total of $389.5 million).

Directed by Lee Unkrich and co-directed by Adrian Molina, Coco centers on a 12-year-old Mexican boy (voiced by newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) who confronts his family’s ancestral ban on music. The cast includes Gael García Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, and Alanna Ubach. The film received excellent reviews from critics and an A-plus CinemaScore from moviegoers.

Disney/Pixar

Meanwhile, James Franco’s meta-movie comedy The Disaster Artist is poised to break into the top five after expanding to 840 theaters from 19 last week. The A24 release is on pace for about $6.4 million, edging out Marvel’s threequel Thor: Ragnarok ($6.3 million) for fourth place and bringing its domestic total to $8 million.

Directed by and starring Franco, and based on Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell’s book of the same name, The Disaster Artist chronicles the making of Tommy Wiseau’s notoriously bad — and much beloved — 2003 independent film The Room. Critics have applauded Franco’s film, which also stars brother Dave Franco (as Sestero), Seth Rogen, Alison Brie, and Ari Graynor.

Rounding out the top five are Warner Bros. and DC’s Justice League at No. 2, with an estimated $9.6 million, and Lionsgate’s Wonder at No. 3, with an estimated $8.5 million.

The former film recently crossed the $200-million mark domestically and is now north of $600 million globally; the latter movie is on track to break $100 million by the end of the weekend.

Squeaking in to the top 10 is the ironically titled comedy Just Getting Started, which represents the final production from embattled upstart Broad Green Pictures. Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Morgan Freeman, and Rene Russo, and directed by Ron Shelton, the film is set to debut in 2,161 theaters with about $3.2 million.

On the specialty front, the darkly comic Tonya Harding biopic I, Tonya is bowing in four theaters with an estimated $245,602, which works out to a robust per-screen average of $61,400. The critically acclaimed film stars Margot Robbie as the infamous figure skater, along with Allison Janney, Sebastian Stan, and Julianne Nicholson. Craig Gillespie directed, and Neon/30West are distributing.

He walked off the field on his own but was later ruled out for the rest of the game.,2017-12-11T00:09:19Z,espn,Eagles' Wentz exits with knee injury vs. Rams,http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/21733078/philadelphia-eagles-qb-carson-wentz-exits-game-vs-los-angeles-rams-knee-injury,http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1210%2Fr300958_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"LOS ANGELES -- The Philadelphia Eagles are concerned that quarterback Carson Wentz tore his left ACL, sources tell ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Wentz exited the Eagles' 43-35 win against Los Angeles Rams late in the third quarter Sunday with a left knee injury and was ruled out.

He came up limping after absorbing multiple hits on a touchdown run that was negated by a holding penalty.

Wentz stayed in the game for the remainder of the drive, which he capped with a fourth-down touchdown throw to Alshon Jeffery that gave the Eagles the lead.

Following the series, Wentz went to the trainers tent to be evaluated, and he was taken indoors a short time later.

Nick Foles immediately began practicing snaps with center Jason Kelce on the sideline in anticipation of going in.

Wentz had four touchdowns on the day. He passed Sonny Jurgensen for the most touchdowns in a single season (33) in franchise history, a record that had stood since 1961.

The Eagles clinched the NFC East and a playoff spot with their win.","philadelphia eagles

Kevin SeifertNFL Nation ,"If the Texans QB could show potential symptoms one moment then be back behind center the next, the policy isn't good enough. Here's how to improve it.",2017-12-10T23:25:07Z,espn,Tom Savage concussion makes clear that NFL's protocol has major issues,http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/261076/tom-savage-concussion-makes-clear-that-nfls-protocol-has-major-issues,http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1210%2Fr301007_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Tom Savage appears to be shaken up after taking a hard hit in the end zone. Savage goes through concussion protocol and returns for a series, but is later replaced by T.J. Yates. (0:33)

The NFL's concussion protocol cannot possibly be considered adequate if it allowed Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage back into Sunday's 26-16 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The policy has been improved and expanded dramatically in recent years, most recently to include discipline for failure to comply, but clearly it remains lacking in a fundamental way.

The image will be seared in our minds for some time. We all saw Savage's helmet slam off the NRG Stadium turf in Houston. He rolled over, his arms bracketed in an apparent display of what's known as the ""fencing response."" His hands twitched as though he were seizing.

Referee John Hussey immediately recognized Savage's distress. According to Texans coach Bill O'Brien, the team's medical staff administered a concussion test when the quarterback reached the sideline. And then, for reasons that will and should be under discussion in the NFL office at this very moment, Savage was cleared and returned to the game for one series. Only when further testing revealed a concussion were the Texans forced to declare Savage out.

Aside from its potential impact on Savage's long-term health, here's the biggest problem with that apparent order of events. If it happened that way, and our current evidence suggests that it did, then the Texans didn't violate the NFL concussion policy as I understand it. It's possible for concussion symptoms to be delayed, and we have several examples in recent years of players passing the test at one moment and then failing it later, including in Week 10 with Indianapolis Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett.

That's the first question the NFL must face as it reviews this policy in the coming weeks and months. Is the test too lenient if Brissett, Savage and others passed it moments after suffering the head trauma that ultimately caused a concussion? Should there be a mandatory waiting period after a hit to the head, one that would guard against the onset of belated symptoms?

People watching the game on TV often have a better view of what happened during a play than medical officials on either sideline. That's why the NFL has installed two certified athletic trainers in a booth above the field, each with a replay machine and a dedicated radio connection to the sidelines. There is also video equipment on the sideline for team doctors and unaffiliated neurological consultants (UNC) to review the mechanism of the injury.

So how could Savage possibly have been sent back into the game when the replay showed obvious concussion symptoms? While the policy provides the equipment, it does not require it to be used during the initial test. Instead, the policy states: ""The sideline medical staff will be able to review the game film on the sidelines to obtain information on particular plays involving possible injury.""

It's difficult to imagine that any of the medical personnel who initially tested Savage, at least anyone with a vested interest in his health, saw the replay before clearing him. All O'Brien said was that ""the evaluators made the determination to put him back in the game."" So, perhaps the NFL should require at least one medical official to view the replay to ensure nothing has been missed before any player can be cleared.

Such a requirement could delay the return of some healthy players, which could perhaps impact the competitive balance of the game. But as we discussed last week, the NFL and its players have given fans too many opportunities this season to question their commitment to brain health. Now is not the time, and really there isn't a good time at all, to prioritize competition over head trauma.

Two years ago, the league installed a discipline schedule for teams that don't follow the protocol. I'm sure the Texans need to explain what happened to the league's medical staff, starting with chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills. There is a maximum of a $150,000 fine to the club on first offense of a documented violation.

I'm not sure how quickly we'll learn the answers. As of Sunday night, the league had not announced the results of its investigation into the Seattle Seahawks' apparent failure to subject quarterback Russell Wilson to an immediate test during a Week 10 game against the Cardinals.

But let's be clear: At the heart of the concussion policy is the credibility of the NFL's commitment to brain health, especially -- but not exclusively -- when you have a player exhibiting the sickening symptoms that Savage did. If a player can be in that position one moment, then back behind center at another, the policy isn't good enough.","indianapolis colts

Steve Fainaru,"How former Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich leveraged big deals and big-time basketball to build the university into a sports powerhouse, only to watch it burn amid charges of excess, exploitation and corruption.",2017-12-10T12:00:00Z,espn,OTL: The making of The University of Adidas at Louisville,http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/21710106/louisville-athletic-director-tom-jurich-leveraged-big-deals-build-university-sports-powerhouse-only-watch-burn-amid-charges-excess,http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1209%2Fadidas_ms_1296x729.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's Dec. 25 'Tis The Season Issue. Subscribe today!

ON THE MORNING of Sept. 26, more than two dozen Adidas employees gathered inside a gym at the University of Louisville. They had flown in from as far away as Europe -- marketers and athletic performance specialists, top designers from Adidas' secretive Brooklyn Creator Farm. They were participating in a weeklong workshop to imagine gear, products and advertising built around Louisville's most valuable commodity: the men's basketball team.

The exercise was meant to simulate the vision behind a $160 million partnership between Adidas and Louisville, which had been announced the previous month. One of the largest all-school sponsorship agreements in Adidas' history, it was much more than a shoe deal. In internal strategy documents, Louisville vowed to ""write the next chapter for college athletics, for streetwear and fashion."" Adidas, a $7.9 billion corporation, would have access not only to the university's amateur athletes but also to the business, law and music schools to help create and market new products.

As the participants prepared for Day 2, Julianne Waldron, Louisville's associate athletic director of marketing and an architect of the deal, received a call.

""Julianne, there's a story that just broke. You need to read it,"" said a public relations official. ""It has to do with Adidas.""

""They're with me right now,"" she replied, confused.

The story involved a different blockbuster deal between Adidas and Louisville -- one that had played out in the shadows but was now being revealed by the U.S. Department of Justice, in New York City. That morning, the FBI had announced a sweeping corruption investigation into college basketball. In one of the most explosive allegations, Adidas employees -- colleagues of the same people who were gathered in the gym -- had paid a $100,000 bribe to a blue-chip recruit's family.

Nothing has been the same in Louisville since. While other schools have avoided taking drastic action in response to the ongoing probe, Louisville has blown up its athletic department. The morning after the FBI's announcement, Dr. Gregory Postel, the interim president, removed not only Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino but also athletic director Tom Jurich, one of the state's most powerful people. Over the past 20 years, Jurich had built a sports empire on top of a midlevel commuter school near the Ohio River, transforming the campus and infusing a genteel Southern city that lacked a professional team with the excitement of big-time sports. Jurich was so successful generating money that ""I wished I could turn them upside down and shake out their pocket change for the academic side,"" says Thomas B. Byers, a professor emeritus in the English department.

Perhaps more than any other place in America, Louisville came to embody the contradictions of college athletics -- a multibillion-dollar industry built on amateur athletes. The Adidas partnership was supposed to be a crowning achievement that validated the university as a national power. The agreement represented an undeniable windfall, with potential opportunities for the entire university, but to some it also exploited the athletes it purported to benefit while encouraging the criminal behavior later alleged by the FBI. Ultimately, the scandal -- on top of two earlier ones involving Louisville basketball, the financial engine of the athletic department -- cost Jurich his job. And it did so while underscoring the moral compromises and questionable priorities at the heart of his success, according to interviews by Outside the Lines with more than three dozen current and former Louisville administrators, athletic department staffers, government officials, state regulators, faculty and local media, as well as independent audits and documents obtained under Kentucky's Open Records Act.

According to the FBI timeline, Adidas and Jurich were nailing down the sponsorship agreement while company representatives were allegedly working to bring 6-foot-7 small forward Brian Bowen to the university. Whether those two deals -- one announced at a news conference, the other negotiated illicitly in the presence of an undercover agent -- were somehow related is one of the major unanswered questions of the spiraling scandal. Jurich, who conceived of the partnership with the shoe company during Adidas-sponsored retreats in Santa Barbara, California, and Banff, Alberta, says he knew nothing about the Bowen deal, but he acknowledged that Adidas, which was to pay Louisville cash incentives for Final Four appearances and NCAA championships, had a financial interest in Louisville's success.

""We all agree with that,"" Jurich says. ""But I didn't think they would have to do it at this cost.""

An Adidas spokeswoman said the company is conducting an investigation of its college basketball programs, and due to the FBI investigation, ""we cannot provide more details.""

When the Adidas contract was announced, it marked the ultimate realization of Jurich's dream to build a national power. Now, to many, it symbolizes something entirely different: the corruption of a public university.

""It's a hustle. I mean, that's what it is,"" says professor Ricky Jones, chairman of Louisville's Pan-African studies department. ""It's about making money. It's about, you know, folks from shoe companies and all the people in their orbit setting up a system that is pimping kids out.""

After the FBI bombshell, Louisville and Adidas quietly shut down the workshop one day early. Waldron, who'd spent 18 months on the partnership, was crushed. Early in her career, she had been deputy director of radio during the Clinton presidency, only to see her work life taken over by the White House sex scandal.

""This is worse,"" she says.

ON A BRIGHT Saturday afternoon in November, Jurich sits inside the Palm Pavilion Beachside Bar & Grill in Clearwater Beach, Florida, having lunch with his wife, Terrilynn, and two of their close friends. Back in Louisville, it's 45 degrees; the football team is set to take on Virginia at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. In Clearwater, Jurich is planning to watch the game at his condo down the street. He wears shorts and a white Louisville baseball T-shirt, one of four times he arrives for interviews wearing Cardinals gear. ""That's my school,"" he says. ""I poured every ounce of myself into that place for 20 years.""

Jurich is a man of average height, but even at 61, he carries himself with a pugnacious, intimidating intensity. Charming and warm one minute, he is sometimes defensive and suspicious. As athletic director, Jurich rarely texted or used email, fearful it could be used against him. ""Why have more fodder for people?"" he says. ""You know how I communicated with people? I picked up the phone, and I went to their face."" Since the university began digging into his records, he says, ""That's the question I get most: 'How do you conduct business?' Well, I think we conducted it pretty damn good.""

When Jurich came to Louisville from Colorado State in 1997, boosters took him and Terrilynn through campus. ""She won't tell you this, but she started crying,"" Jurich says. Terrilynn had grown up in Wyoming, Jurich in Southern California. At Colorado State, where Jurich had been athletic director, the football stadium looked out on the Rockies. In Louisville, the Juriches found an industrial wasteland. The defining landmarks were a pair of silos, which stood between the campus and Interstate 65.

""What did you get us into?"" Terrilynn asked.

Louisville had won NCAA titles in men's basketball under Denny Crum in 1980 and 1986, but most other sports were underfunded and neglected. Jurich says he spoke with Lamar Daniel, a former investigator in the U.S. Office for Civil Rights, who told him Louisville was facing a potential lawsuit over its failure to comply with Title IX. ""He said, 'This is the worst school in the United States,'"" Jurich says. Louisville's athletics budget then was $16.5 million. Jurich embarked on an ambitious growth strategy that would solve Louisville's Title IX problems and build up nonrevenue sports such as swimming and soccer while ensuring that the basketball and football teams were successful enough to support the enterprise.

The strategy required prodigious cash; by this year, Louisville's athletics budget was up to $104.5 million. ""He treated his donors like investors,"" says Jurich's friend Larry Benz, a member of the Louisville Athletic Association, which oversees the department. Jurich built $280 million in arenas, playing fields and athletic offices by convincing rich people of the facilities' vital importance. ""I can give $5 million to stem cell research and it's gonna help stem cell research,"" says Dr. Mark Lynn, an optometry-chain owner whose name adorns the soccer complex. ""I give $5 million to a soccer stadium and it's gonna help everything."" Lynn says sports bring the school visibility.

Jurich's record included three Final Four appearances and a national championship in men's basketball, a Sugar Bowl victory, a Heisman Trophy winner, two title-game appearances in women's basketball and four appearances in the College World Series. Louisville won 67 conference titles and produced 287 All-Americans. The athlete graduation rate shot up 30 points, to 86 percent. Waldron, the sports marketing director, calls Jurich ""probably the finest leader I ever worked for,"" pointing out that he promoted women inside and outside the department. ""He's a feminist, really,"" she says.

Learning that Jurich had been fired was ""like a death,"" she says.

MUCH OF THE athletic department's finances was shrouded in secrecy, hidden from the Louisville Athletic Association and the board of trustees. Two former trustees told Outside the Lines that they were unaware of large real estate transactions involving the athletic department and the Louisville Foundation, the school's endowment, which raises money for education and research.

Dawn Heinecken, a professor who sits on the athletic association board, says the board learned about the Adidas deal ""after it was announced publicly. That was the first I heard about it.""

James Ramsey, who was president of both the university and the foundation, resigned last year amid allegations that he mismanaged endowment funds. Ramsey and Jurich had a close working relationship: Ramsey, in secret, approved additional compensation that earned Jurich an average of $2.77 million annually over the past seven years and approved several real estate transactions that benefited the athletic department. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Jurich's perks included tax ""gross-ups"" -- meaning the university paid some of his taxes -- membership in three country clubs and premium seats at the Kentucky Derby.

""I don't think Tom Jurich gets this, and I don't think Jim Ramsey got it,"" says state Rep. Jim Wayne, whose district includes parts of Louisville. ""The University of Louisville is a state facility ... and it is not their kingdom. They are not the kings, and the princes, and the nobility in the kingdom. They're temporary stewards of these programs. And instead of seeing this as something that they should be responsible for and hold high ethical standards as they execute their jobs, they're doing just the opposite.""

Out of 125 FBS schools required to report financial data to the U.S. Department of Education, Louisville is the only one that derives more than half of its men's sports revenue from basketball, says Jonathan Jensen, a sports marketing professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Much of that revenue comes from a $238 million taxpayer-funded arena, the KFC Yum Center, which opened downtown in 2010 and has become a heavy burden on taxpayers. The lease was negotiated by Jurich and the arena authority. Under the terms, taxpayer contributions make up 75 percent of the arena's operating income while Louisville gets to keep most of the revenue -- an arrangement that ""blew our mind,"" says state auditor Mike Harmon, whose office examined the arena's finances. ""It was like, 'This is ridiculous.' It's like co-signing the loan for a friend's home and then having to pay three-fourths of the mortgage.""

Denis Frankenberger, a local businessman who has dissected the lease in minute detail, calls it ""the biggest taxpayer scandal in the history of Louisville.""

In the arena's first year, men's basketball revenue jumped 58 percent, from $25.9 million to $40.9 million, a trend that continued as the program became the richest in the country. Under the lease, Louisville keeps 88 percent of premium seat licensing, 97 percent of suite sales, all program revenue and half of concessions.

""Why is it I'm accountable for everything and all we've done is been successful? But these other people get a free pass? If I was a humanities professor, do you think I'd sit there and say, 'Man, I can't get it done, poor me'? I'd never say that. I'd go find a way to get it done."" Ex-Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich

As Louisville was growing richer, the arena was failing -- partly due to the lopsided lease, partly due to tax estimates based on ""flawed data,"" Harmon says. By early this year, the arena required a bailout to keep it from defaulting on more than $300 million in bond debt. Jurich's athletic department agreed to pay an additional $2.4 million a year. The public, meanwhile, was saddled with another 25 years of arena-related taxes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. In the end, the arena will cost more than $1 billion, with taxpayers funding most of it. Despite the bailout, some experts fear the FBI probe's effect on the arena's primary tenant could be catastrophic.

""We took all the risk"" on the arena, Jurich insists, pointing out that the athletic budget is heavily dependent on arena funds. When told that the city and taxpayers primarily support the arena, Jurich says he wanted to build it on campus, but city officials persuaded him to move it downtown. ""Nobody twisted their arm,"" he says. ""They brought this offer to us. I didn't go to them and say I got to have this, this and this and this.""

Told of Jurich's comments, Wayne, the state representative, responds: ""That's pure hogwash. They didn't take any risk. When you're getting over 90 percent of all the suite revenue and 90 percent of that revenue goes to the University of Louisville's athletic facilities, and their funds, where's the risk?""

F. Chris Gorman, a former Kentucky attorney general, says: ""I think that the tragedy here is this is probably the only community that uses public money to fund a Division I athletic program. That's what led to all this corruption: They had all this money -- money from the foundation, money from the arena, money from the students. You add all that up, and then they have a budget to compete with the Ohio States of the world. But they haven't done it in an honest way. They've done it by fleecing the taxpayers and by taking money from the foundation, men and women that worked all their lives and thought they were giving money to education.""

Jurich bristles at such implications, saying the transactions were aboveboard and brought enormous benefits to the university and the city. He says he can't understand why people now blame him for raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build a world-class athletic program.

""Wasn't that what I was hired to do?"" he says.

JURICH'S BUILDING SPREE transformed the Louisville campus and parts of the city. Bars and restaurants opened in the riverfront neighborhood around the KFC Yum Center. Cardinal Park, which houses the track, soccer and softball stadiums, as well as a community playground and public athletic facilities, became the ""front lawn"" of the university for visitors and students on South Floyd Street. Louisville, which belonged to Conference USA when Jurich became athletic director, joined the ACC in 2014, bringing in $47.7 million in the first two years. Matt Jones, a frequent Jurich critic who broadcasts out of Lexington for Kentucky Sports Radio, says Jurich and Pitino changed the attitude of the university. ""They made that campus appealing,"" Jones says. ""They injected self-confidence in a place that really needed it. They told everybody, 'You don't have to be second fiddle to Kentucky.'""

Jurich and his supporters predicted that the rising tide that accompanied Louisville's migration to the ACC would lift up the academic boat. Yet the university, which is ranked 165th in U.S. News & World Report among national universities, continued to languish. Between 2008 and 2017, Kentucky cut state funding for higher education by 26.4 percent. The disparity between the athletic department's soaring budget and the realities of a shrinking university demoralized faculty; some referred to the chasm as East and West Berlin. Susan Jarosi, an associate professor of women's and gender studies and art history who played soccer at the University of Virginia, says the new sports facilities were less inspiring than soul-crushing: ""It sucks, it just sucks, to come off another year, and you're walking around, you're driving around, and there's this massive construction, summer after summer. It's like, 'Where is this money coming from?'""

Jurich pulled in far more than the $1.4 million base salary that ranked him among the highest-paid ADs in the nation. Including other compensation, he earned $5.3 million in 2016, which, as The Courier-Journal points out, was more than the budgets of the biology, English, history and math departments. Jurich and his wife have vacation homes in Clearwater Beach and in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Their son Mark, a former pro baseball player, was paid an average of $133,545 to work as senior associate athletic director for development. To circumvent Louisville's nepotism policy, most of that salary was paid by the Louisville Foundation. Earlier this year, before the Adidas deal was announced, Jurich's daughter Haley, who has experience in sports marketing, was hired by the company to serve as a liaison between Adidas and Louisville. (She was initially placed on administrative leave after the FBI scandal and is planning to move to company headquarters in Portland, Oregon.) Pitino was to make $7.7 million this season in total pay. He is suing the Louisville Athletic Association for more than $35 million, as well as Adidas, which terminated a personal services contract that was believed to pay him well over $1 million annually.

Jarosi, who has taught at Louisville for 10 years, recently saw her annual salary increase from $60,000 to $66,000. She was grateful for the raise but says she's appalled by the disparity between academic salaries and ""the alternate universe"" of the athletic department: ""Just the idea that someone at Louisville is a multi-multimillionaire for seven years of service, that just makes me ... I don't know what. It's horrifying!""

Told about the frustrations expressed by several professors, Jurich wonders why some academic departments can't rebuild themselves in the same way he built up the athletic department. ""They couldn't have gone out and raised money?"" he says. ""Why is it I'm accountable for everything and all we've done is been successful? But these other people get a free pass? If I was a humanities professor, do you think I'd sit there and say, 'Man, I can't get it done, poor me'? I'd never say that. I'd go find a way to get it done. You know what? Those schools have alumni too. Those schools have very rich graduates too. Nobody handed me anything when I walked into this place. Nobody. It was quite the contrary.""

The athletic department's unfettered growth was undented by the scandals that occurred under Jurich's watch. Jurich refused to fire Pitino despite a string of public embarrassments, including Pitino's affair with a woman who was later sent to prison for trying to extort him, and ""Strippergate,"" in which a Pitino assistant coach, over a period of four years, brought in dancers and prostitutes to entertain recruits at a university dorm. Louisville is appealing NCAA sanctions for Strippergate and if denied will be stripped of 123 wins, including its 2013 national title. In 2013, Jurich retained a former assistant football coach, even after the NCAA had sanctioned the coach for receiving and handing out thousands of dollars while at the University of Miami. In 2014, with Louisville about to join the ACC, Jurich brought back Bobby Petrino as football coach after he had been fired by Arkansas for lying about his own affair with a 25-year-old assistant.

""I looked at each situation the best way I possibly could,"" Jurich says.

Jurich sought to neutralize the scandals and shape the athletic department's image by controlling the local media, according to interviews with more than half a dozen journalists and media executives -- many of whom requested anonymity out of fear of reprisals from Louisville, even with Jurich gone. They described consistent and aggressive efforts to influence coverage, including abusive calls to radio talk-show hosts and executives by Jurich and his surrogates; threats to get advertising pulled from stations; and attempts to influence hiring and firing. Jurich denies he sought to influence advertisers or pressure the media. Nearly all of the media members identified Bob Gunnell, a public relations specialist, as Jurich's main surrogate and attack dog. The Louisville athletic department has a sports information group that employs 11 people, but contracts obtained by Outside the Lines show Jurich paid Gunnell's outside PR firm, Boxcar, up to $130,000 per year dating to 2014. Shortly after Jurich was fired, Gunnell cut ties with the university. He now represents Jurich personally.

This year Jones, the well-connected host of Kentucky Sports Radio, told his audience he had heard Jurich's job was in jeopardy. Jones later said on Periscope that Boxcar pressured his bosses to retract the report and issue an on-air apology. Jones, facing a suspension, initially refused and says he agreed to apologize only because he was scheduled to broadcast from an event the next day and some listeners were traveling long distances to attend. But he extracted a promise: When he was proved right, he could go on the air and say his bosses had ordered him to lie.

When Jurich was fired, Jones did just that, telling his listeners: ""My bosses forced me to go on the air and lie to people.""

Gunnell says his role was to assist the university's sports information office and review media rights proposals. ""I wasn't Tom's attack dog,"" he says. Gunnell says he does not believe that he pressured Jones' bosses to issue a retraction.

""It's about making money. It's about, you know, folks from shoe companies and all the people in their orbit setting up a system that is pimping kids out."" Ricky Jones, chairman of Louisville's Pan-African studies department

ADIDAS DIDN'T SEEM to care much about Louisville's scandals.

On June 15, the NCAA announced that it had suspended Pitino for five conference games over Strippergate and ordered Louisville to forfeit dozens of games, including the 2013 NCAA title. On Aug. 25, at Louisville, Jurich and Adidas held a joint news conference to announce the new $160 million sponsorship agreement.

""We're part of the Adidas family, and I certainly hope they know they are part of the Cardinal family,"" Jurich said then.

When Jurich signed Louisville's first all-school deal with Adidas, in 1998, he was happy just to get a discount on gear. At that point, it was about appearances. But as Louisville became more successful, the value went up. In 2014, the two sides signed a five-year, $39 million extension. Within two years, Jurich was thinking bigger. At an Adidas-sponsored retreat for athletic directors in May 2016 in Santa Barbara, Jurich says he told Jim Murphy, Adidas' sports marketing director for NCAA matters: ""If we're going to be with you, I want a long-term deal. And I want it to be one of the biggest deals in the country.""

He had a lot of leverage. In 2013, in addition to winning the national championship in men's basketball, Louisville beat No. 3 Florida in the Sugar Bowl and made the finals in baseball and women's hoops. Jurich commissioned a $185,000 documentary, Year of the Cardinal, which aired on ESPNU.

The Adidas deal quadrupled the company's commitment to Louisville in cash and gear and was a huge bet on Jurich's vision. The average annual compensation of the 10-year contract was exceeded only by Under Armour's deal with UCLA ($18.7 million) and Nike's deals with Ohio State ($16.8 million) and Texas ($16.7 million) -- universities with at least twice Louisville's enrollment.

Waldron says she was oblivious to the recruiting negotiations that allegedly were taking place simultaneously between representatives of Louisville and Adidas.

The talks began in May 2017, according to the FBI. To lure Brian Bowen, an unsigned five-star recruit from Saginaw, Michigan, an unidentified Louisville assistant allegedly conspired with Jim Gatto, Adidas' director of global sports marketing for basketball; Merl Code Jr., who came to Adidas after running Nike's powerful grassroots program; sports agent Christian Dawkins; and financial planner J. Munish Sood to funnel $100,000 to Bowen's family.

During a July conversation recorded by the FBI, Code explained the plan to pay off Bowen as ""one of those instances where we needed to step up and help one of our flagship schools ... secure a five-star-caliber kid. Obviously, that helps, you know, our potential business.""

For the next four months, under FBI surveillance, the men engineered the payment to Bowen's father while plotting how to route money to another Louisville recruit. Brad Augustine, an Adidas-sponsored AAU program director, predicted in one meeting that Pitino would be instrumental because ""no one swings a bigger d--- at Adidas than"" him. Neither Pitino nor any other head coach or university is named in the FBI affidavit, but ABC News has identified Pitino as the one referred to as ""Coach-2.""

After Bowen committed to Louisville, Pitino told Terry Meiners of News Radio 840: ""We got lucky on this one. ... We spent zero dollars recruiting a five-star athlete who I loved when I saw him play. In my 40 years of coaching, this is the luckiest I've been.""

The Adidas spokeswoman says the firm put Gatto on administrative leave and ended ""any consulting relationships related to the allegations,"" an apparent reference to Code.

When it all came crashing down, Jurich was in Washington, D.C., at the ACC meetings. He received a call from Kenny Klein, Louisville's senior associate athletic director for sports information. Jurich says he has never heard of Gatto or Code and that he had dealt exclusively with Murphy and Chris McGuire, Adidas' senior director of sports marketing, who signed the sponsorship agreement. When he made it back to Louisville, Jurich says, he confronted Pitino and then-assistant coach David Padgett, who later replaced Pitino. Both denied that they were aware of the payment to Bowen.

The next day, Jurich was summoned to the office of Postel, the interim president, who he says asked him to resign. Jurich refused. Postel then handed him a letter informing him that he'd been placed on administrative leave, pending a decision by the board of trustees. The meeting lasted roughly 90 seconds, Jurich says.

Postel initially said he wanted to review the Adidas contract. Louisville spokesman John Karman III says the university has since decided to ""move forward with the contract as planned next year.""

During a meeting recorded by the FBI, Adidas' Merl Code Jr., center, explained that a plan to pay the family of a five-star recruit for him to attend Louisville was ""one of those instances where we needed to step up and help one of our flagship schools."" Stephanie Keith/Getty Images

BEFORE HE WAS fired, Jurich's colleagues had been planning a surprise gala to celebrate his 20th anniversary as athletic director. The party was to take place on Oct. 12 at the PNC Club, a 20,000-square-foot suite at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium on South Floyd Street, the Vegas Strip of glittering athletic facilities that Jurich built.

That party, of course, was canceled. Jurich says he was told he was forbidden even to return to his office, which for weeks remained on lockdown, like a crime scene. Karman says that is standard university procedure toward dismissed employees, who can return later to retrieve items.

On Oct. 18, Jurich was fired by a 10-3 vote of the trustees. His termination letter, delivered by Postel, was a two-page screed. Jurich had created ""a culture of tolerance,"" Postel wrote, entered into secret transactions ""for your own financial or other benefit"" and engaged in ""willful misconduct demonstrated through ineffective management, divisive leadership, unprofessional conduct, and a lack of collegiality best characterized as intimidation and bullying that extends from student government to the University's senior leadership. This has caused substantial damage to the University.""

Jurich, in the aftermath, seems like a man who feels bewildered and betrayed, as if he were fired for doing his job too well.

""I've given this school 20 years of dignity,"" Jurich says. ""I would hope I would get a little bit in return, and I certainly haven't yet.""","louisvilles panafrican studies department adidas

David SchoenfieldESPN Senior Writer ,"It has been a slow offseason so far in Major League Baseball. But as MLB descends on Disney World, all sorts of magic might happen.",2017-12-10T11:30:00Z,espn,"Your guide to the winter meetings: Superstars, blockbusters -- and total chaos",http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/21710587/superstars-blockbusters-total-chaos,http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1209%2Fmlb_winter_meetings3_16x9.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"This had been a slow cooker of a month since the World Series ended, with little happening outside the purview of Jerry Dipoto. Then Shohei Ohtani announced he's going to the Angels! Then the Marlins and Yankees agreed to terms on a Giancarlo Stanton trade! Game on.

Still, the top 21 free agents on Keith Law's top-50 list remained unsigned. At this point, however, it's clear many of these deals aren't going to come down until late January or even the early days of spring training. I think three issues have slowed the market:

1. Ohtani and Stanton. This was only a minor effect on what's happened, because Ohtani's initial contract -- the major league minimum -- shouldn't have influenced a team's other offseason moves. He'd merely have been considered a bonus acquisition. The exhausting Stanton dispatches impacted only a few teams, although maybe the Cardinals and Giants held off on other moves.

MLB Offseason From Keith Law's free-agent rankings to all the big moves, we have the MLB offseason covered.

• Complete MLB hot stove coverage »

2. It's a risky free-agent class. There isn't a free agent out there without an obvious flaw or two. J.D. Martinez is the best hitter available and he's a 30-year-old corner outfielder with below-average defense who probably has to move to DH in a couple seasons (if not immediately). Yu Darvish is the best pitcher, but he has a Tommy John surgery in his past and concerns about his durability and postseason performance. Eric Hosmer had a terrific 2017 but has been wildly inconsistent throughout his career. And so on. Does J.D. Martinez sound like a $200 million ballplayer to you? Of course not. Front offices are simply waiting for the agents to drop their asking prices.

3. Teams are saving money for 2018-19, a much deeper class of free agents that includes Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Josh Donaldson, Charlie Blackmon, probably Clayton Kershaw, and a whole slew of dominant relievers.

The good news is the winter meetings start Sunday at Disney World. Lots of face-to-face communication! The expectation that deals will be made! Agents and sports writers acting like best buddies to get inside information! It all means the dam is about to burst and we should finally see some major action. Here's a preview:

Top five stars who could be traded

Marcell Ozuna, OF, Marlins. The Marlins have said they want to keep Ozuna (and Christian Yelich), but if the Astros-like teardown is happening, then you might as well strip everything to the bones. Ozuna is coming off a monster .312/.376/.548 year and has two seasons left until free agency. Is there value to keeping him around if Stanton is gone and you're rebuilding?

Jose Abreu, 1B, White Sox. We've heard the Red Sox rumors, and it makes some sense for them to trade for Abreu and about $40 million in arbitration salaries the next two seasons rather than spend $100 million-plus on Hosmer. Even though the White Sox are unlikely contenders the next two seasons and cashing in Abreu for more young talent sounds logical, they might just keep him. The front office values his leadership in the clubhouse and views him as a mentor to all the young players, especially fellow Cuban Yoan Moncada. They'll have to be blown away to make a deal.

Chris Archer finished third in the AL last season with 249 strikeouts. Patrick Gorski/USA TODAY Sports

Chris Archer, P, Rays. Yes, another winter meetings with Archer trade rumors. He's attractive not just because he's good and a workhorse -- three straight seasons with 200 innings, one of just five pitchers who can make that claim -- but because his contract is so team-friendly. He's owed just $34 million and change over the next four seasons. The Rays also have a nice group of young starters in Blake Snell, Jake Faria, Brent Honeywell and Jose De Leon. They have to be realistic: Can they contend right now with the Red Sox and Yankees? If they can get a couple of impact prospects for Archer, maybe it's time to finally deal him.

Editor's Picks Five trades we'd love to see at the winter meetings A star slugger to the Cardinals? A coveted young ace to the Dodgers? With baseball's winter meetings just days away, we offer a handful of deals that make sense for all sides.

Andrew McCutchen, OF, Pirates. He's no longer an MVP candidate and shouldn't be considered a center fielder at this point in his career, but the bat still plays. He has one season remaining until free agency. The Pirates could also look to deal Gerrit Cole, who has two years left of team control.

Victor Robles, OF, Nationals. OK, he's a future star. While he seems like the heir apparent to replace Bryce Harper, the Yankees' trade for Stanton also means it's more likely Harper remains in Washington after 2018. If the Nationals decide they want another starting pitcher, maybe Robles is the bait.

Five teams that can create winter meetings chaos

San Francisco Giants. Even after losing out on Stanton and Ohtani, the Giants have a lot of wheels spinning. At the minimum, they need a center fielder and third baseman, and the front office has talked of reconstructing the bullpen. They could still use a power bat in the outfield (which ranked last in the majors in home runs).

Chicago Cubs. They filled one rotation hole with Tyler Chatwood, but the big question remains: Do they trade a young position player? The Cubs have Addison Russell, Javier Baez, Kyle Schwarber, Ian Happ and Albert Almora -- five players for four positions. That doesn't even include veteran Ben Zobrist, who is signed for two more years. They need another starting pitcher and a closer.

Boston Red Sox. We know they're going to add a big bat. It could be Abreu or Martinez or Hosmer, or maybe they simply sign Carlos Santana or Logan Morrison.

Los Angeles Dodgers. They're not going to sit quietly. They never seemed eager to join in the Stanton sweepstakes, but are they happy with a Joc Pederson/Enrique Hernandez platoon in left field? Or do they feel Alex Verdugo is ready? They need a setup guy for Kenley Jansen, whether it's re-signing Brandon Morrow or somebody else. They traded for Yu Darvish last year to bolster the rotation, so they could acquire a starter. They have money and prospects, and Andrew Friedman and company will do something.

St. Louis Cardinals. They signed Miles Mikolas for the rotation, but more moves are needed to compete with the Cubs, Dodgers and Nationals. Their desire for an impact hitter is known, as they have depth but need a star. They could maybe still use another starter. The bullpen needs another arm or two.

Five other players who could be traded

Billy Hamilton finished second in the majors last season with 59 stolen bases. Andy Lyons/Getty Images

Billy Hamilton, CF, Reds. We just mentioned the Giants need a center fielder. The Rangers need one. The Mariners needed one but traded for Dee Gordon and plan to move him there. The Orioles could trade for a center fielder and move Adam Jones to a corner.

Yasmani Grandal, C, Dodgers. By the postseason, Austin Barnes became the starter. It could be a catching controversy if you keep both, and Grandal is in his final season before free agency. You can see this one both ways. Having two good catchers is a great luxury; having two good catchers is an unnecessary luxury. The Nationals need an upgrade over Matt Wieters, but would the Dodgers trade Grandal to one of their top rivals for National League supremacy?

Jake Odorizzi, P, Rays. If they keep Archer, maybe the Rays instead trade Odorizzi, although he's coming off a 30-homer season that hurts his value.

Ian Kinsler, 2B, Tigers. As the Tigers rebuild, there's no point keeping Kinsler, who is signed through 2018. After averaging 5.7 WAR from 2013 to 2016, Kinsler slipped to 2.1 in 2017, and he'll be entering his age-36 season. That hurts his trade value and there isn't a contending team with an obvious hole at second base. One possibility is the Red Sox, as Dustin Pedroia isn't expected back until May after knee surgery. The Angels are another.

Cesar Hernandez, 2B, Phillies. Rookie Scott Kingery is ready to take over at second, making Hernandez and his .373 OBP nice trade bait.

Five players who should be traded

Raisel Iglesias, P, Reds. Iglesias has been one of the more underrated relievers the past two seasons, compiling a 2.51 ERA in a tough park for pitchers. Still, the Reds are early in their rebuilding process, and a good closer is a luxury for a bad team. Iglesias is especially attractive, since he's cost-controlled for the next three seasons at less than $16 million, plus an arbitration year in 2021. For four years of Iglesias, the Reds should be able to get an impact prospect and a couple of lottery tickets.

Brad Hand, P, Padres. Like Iglesias, Hand is a luxury. The Padres resisted trading him last summer, and it might be difficult dealing him while relievers such as Wade Davis, Jake McGee and Anthony Swarzak are available on the free-agent market. Still, Hand has developed into one of the better lefty relievers in the game with a 2.56 the past two seasons (while having one of the heaviest workloads for a reliever). He's under team control for two more seasons. The Padres could wait until the 2018 trade deadline, but in waiting, they risk injury and performance decline.

Danny Salazar, P, Indians. The Indians are the one team with a surplus of starting pitching, with enough depth thanks to Mike Clevinger's breakout that even trading Salazar leaves Josh Tomlin as the No. 5 starter. Among pitchers with at least 100 innings, Salazar ranked fourth in the majors in strikeout rate. He did miss some time with injuries in June and July but was throwing well at season's end and is still under team control for three more seasons. With Santana departing as a free agent, they need a first baseman, although more prospect depth doesn't hurt.

Kyle Schwarber, OF, Cubs. Despite a short stint in the minors, Schwarber still managed to slug 30 home runs -- he also hit just .211 with a .315 OBP. Throw in his poor defense and Schwarber was worth 0.0 WAR. We know how much the Cubs love him and Schwarber is working hard to drop some weight this offseason. He also hit .255/.338/.565 after his return from the minors, and maybe that's his true upside at the plate. At heart, however, he feels like an American League player. With the Cubs needing pitching help, maybe they deal the fan favorite.

Manny Machado, 3B, Orioles. They should trade him, but they won't.

Five free-agent predictions for winter meetings week

Red Sox sign Carlos Santana. Less expensive than Hosmer, but just as valuable.

Twins sign Alex Cobb. They need rotation help and have money to spend.

Rockies sign Jay Bruce. They can use him either in right field or first base.

Braves sign Mike Moustakas. Most of the playoff contenders are set at third base, but the Braves need to find some power support for Freddie Freeman.

Dodgers sign Anthony Swarzak. They need bullpen depth and can't wait for Morrow.

Which means ... no Darvish yet, no Martinez yet, no Hosmer yet, no Jake Arrieta or Zack Cozart. Check back in January.","bryce harper manny machado josh donaldson charlie blackmon

Buster OlneyESPN Senior Writer ,"Clubs like the Giants, Cardinals and Cubs have to move on to other key areas for improvement. What positions and players will they prioritize now?",2017-12-10T17:45:22Z,espn,Olney: Teams turn to their next action items after Ohtani and Stanton,http://espn.go.com/blog/buster-olney/insider/post/_/id/17748/olney-teams-turn-to-their-next-action-items-after-ohtani-and-stanton,http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1210%2Fr300786_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Major League Baseball’s winter market has finally reached the place that a lot of agents have waited for, through the sluggish days of November and early December. Shohei Ohtani’s future is settled, and the many teams that failed to land him must now shake themselves out of their dream state. The Miami Marlins have concluded one of the greatest salary dumps in professional sports history, moving Giancarlo Stanton to the New York Yankees.

Ohtani and Stanton were considered to be the most coveted market alternatives among starting pitchers and hitters, respectively, and now that they are off the board, other players slide upward, into focus.

MLB Offseason From Keith Law's free-agent rankings to all the big moves, we have the MLB offseason covered.

• Complete MLB hot stove coverage »

With that in mind, and with the winter meetings beginning today in Orlando, Florida, a list of some of the most pressing points of business in the market:

San Francisco Giants: power hitter. Stanton would have solved their desperate need for home runs, and because he’s an effective defensive outfielder, he would’ve help address the Giants’ other priority this winter: run prevention. But Stanton wouldn’t accept a deal to San Francisco, and that leaves the Giants in a situation in which they might have to make stark choices about whether to focus on adding power or defense.

If they prioritize home runs, then free agent J.D. Martinez would be the natural fit, coming off a season in which he was one of baseball’s best sluggers. They could play him in left field or right and he would upgrade their offense, unquestionably, hitting behind Buster Posey in the Giants’ lineup. But Martinez’s defensive metrics were not good last year, and given that he’s 30 now, that probably isn’t going to change. If the Giants sign Martinez, they would have to get comfortable with his inevitable defensive regression over his time in San Francisco.

If the Giants focus on defense, then Lorenzo Cain would probably be the better alternative. He could play center field, enabling a shift of Denard Span to left field. But Cain is not a premier power hitter, and the Giants would have to hope they could generate homers elsewhere (perhaps with an investment of Mike Moustakas at third base).

The Giants have a lot of financial commitments and have luxury tax concerns, but the fact that they were willing to take Stanton’s contract is a sign that San Francisco’s ownership -- a wildly successful group that just finished paying off its privately funded ballpark, and stands to make a lot of money in real estate development around AT&T Park -- is less concerned about its payroll cost. Rather, the Giants want to do what it takes to win and compete with the Dodgers again, after their disastrous 2017 season.

It’s easier for the Giants to add through free agency than through trade, given the industry perception that San Francisco’s minor league system is thin in prospects. The Giants could try to move on the Marlins’ Christian Yelich or Marcell Ozuna, but they probably would be at a disadvantage to a team like St. Louis in what they could offer.

St. Louis Cardinals: middle-of-the-order masher. If Stanton didn’t have a no-trade clause, then he probably would be hitting third or fourth in the St. Louis lineup in 2018, given the Cardinals' level of aggressiveness in talks with the Marlins. But Stanton didn’t want to go to the Cardinals, and so St. Louis must shift in other directions.

The Cardinals already planned to move Dexter Fowler to a corner spot in the outfield, with Tommy Pham taking over center field. They have picked up the threads of the conversations they’ve had with the Marlins about Stanton and can apply that knowledge to talks about Miami’s two other veteran outfielders, Yelich and Ozuna; either would bolster the St. Louis offense.

In recent seasons, the Cardinals have been an island of misfit toys, with a mix of players sometimes out of position. John Mozeliak, the team’s president of baseball operations, seems intent on cleaning that up this winter.

Boston Red Sox: middle-of-the-order masher. After trades for Craig Kimbrel, Drew Pomeranz and Chris Sale, Boston’s farm system doesn’t have a lot of marketable alternatives, in the eyes of rival evaluators. But the Red Sox have money, and president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski has acknowledged a willingness to spend.

Former Indians first baseman Carlos Santana probably won’t be as expensive as Eric Hosmer, but his inconsistency and price tag might scare the Red Sox away. Agent Scott Boras wants big money for Hosmer and J.D. Martinez -- maybe too much for the Red Sox, at least at the beginning of the offseason. But the Yankees have a funny way of pushing the Red Sox and vice versa, and with the Yankees now poised to run out a modern-day murderers’ row of Aaron Judge, Stanton, Gary Sanchez and others, Boston might feel pressure to spend more.

Who's available on the Hot Stove? Who's still on the market as teams hunt for help this winter?

Insider: Law's top free agents | Trade market

Colorado Rockies: closer. The presence and work of Greg Holland completely altered the Rockies’ pitching staff in 2017, and Colorado reached the postseason for the first time in a decade. The Rockies could re-sign Holland, but if they don’t, it figures they will try to get an established closer -- someone like Wade Davis, perhaps.

Chicago Cubs: starting pitcher. Jake Arrieta and John Lackey are gone, and now that the Cubs know they aren’t getting Shohei Ohtani, their focus seems to be turning to one of the most coveted starting pitchers in the market, Alex Cobb. The right-hander pitched for Joe Maddon in Tampa Bay, and if the Cubs add him to the rotation -- after signing Tyler Chatwood earlier this week -- they will have plugged the most significant holes in their roster. Their rotation could look like this:

LHP Jon Lester

RHP Kyle Hendricks

RHP Alex Cobb

LHP Jose Quintana

RHP Tyler Chatwood

This would be unspectacular but solid, and leave the Cubs in position to address their bullpen needs.

Pittsburgh Pirates: trade Andrew McCutchen. The marriage between the Pirates and the longtime outfielder seems to be reaching the point of expiration, because McCutchen is a free agent next fall and almost certainly will be looking for more money than the team wants to pay. After some tension last year over the shift of McCutchen out of center field -- and then the move back, after the suspension of Starling Marte -- it might be best for both sides to move on. On Saturday, Pittsburgh GM Neal Huntington spoke with fans about McCutchen’s status, acknowledging the possibility that the Pirates’ most popular player might be dealt. According to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, Huntington said, “The player who stays with one team for his entire career has become a rarity. I get that, [to] a fan, that's horrible. Unfortunately, now players come and players go.”

As Huntington’s thoughts were dispersed through social media, McCutchen tweeted this:

If you listen to nonsense, how can expect those things to make sense? Say nothing 🤫🤭but do everything. — andrew mccutchen (@TheCUTCH22) December 9, 2017

And then this:

Other teams expect the Pirates to trade McCutchen this winter, and if they do, then the Giants are among the teams that could provide a fit.

New York Mets: second base and first base. For a team so unsettled by injuries in 2017, the Mets actually don’t have a long list of needs. But they are looking for a second baseman, and as Mike Puma of the New York Post reported, they will check with the Marlins about the price for Starlin Castro, who could help them at second -- or first, for that matter. The Mets want somebody to hold down first base temporarily, to buy more development time for Dominic Smith.

Los Angeles Angels: second base and third base. With Ohtani on board, Angels GM Billy Eppler has addressed his greatest need while spending almost nothing. In a couple of years, the Angels will undoubtedly discuss a long-term deal with the two-way player, but for now their financial obligation to him is only a $2.3 million signing bonus, a minimum salary of $545,000 in 2018 and slightly over minimum in 2019.

That frees up dollars for the Angels to plug the holes they have at second and third base. They have talked with the Tigers about Ian Kinsler, could pursue new Marlin Starlin Castro (who is available), or choose the free-agent route with someone like Brandon Phillips or Neil Walker. Free agent Todd Frazier could make a lot of sense for them at third base.

Within the next three years, the Angels will attempt to make heavy investments in Mike Trout and Ohtani, so their second-base and third-base solutions now might be short-term.

Toronto Blue Jays: outfield help. There has been a lot of speculation about whether the Jays might be open to trading third baseman Josh Donaldson, who will be a free agent in the fall of 2018 -- and it might make some sense for Toronto to move him now if they’re not interested in signing Donaldson, who turned 32 on Friday, to a long-term deal. But through a frustrating season in 2017, Toronto finished fifth in the majors in attendance, drawing 3.2 million fans, and the Jays have to consider the impact of a possible Donaldson trade on the fans’ perception of the team. He is their best position player and their most popular player, and moving him would alienate a lot of folks buying tickets.

It seems more likely the Jays will bet on a bounce-back season from their rotation, and augment an outfield that has been depleted in recent years. Last winter, the Jays made a hard run at Fowler, before Fowler signed with the Cardinals, and Cain is a similar type of player -- a center fielder with power and speed. The Jays could also try to lure free agent Jay Bruce, a player they attempted to trade for in the past.

News from around the majors

Cain is in an interesting position this winter because among outfielders, he’s almost a market of one: someone who could play anywhere in the outfield, with a full range of skills. Cain rated a plus-5 in defensive runs saved in 2017, ranking among the better center fielders. He’s also a high-end baserunner: FanGraphs’ baserunning metric places him in the upper echelon. His on-base percentage rose to .363 last season, and his strikeout rate fell to a career-low 15.5 percent.

Cain turns 32 next April, and some teams fret about his injury history: He has reached 135 games in a season twice in his career.

• Moustakas hit 38 homers last year and is a good defensive third baseman, and he was at the core of the Royals’ success in 2014 and 2015. Some evaluators expressed concern about his on-base percentage (.314 last season) and his body, fearing that he might be vulnerable to breakdowns.

• The conversations between the Yankees and CC Sabathia about a return for 2018 have begun. Sabathia is a good friend of new manager Aaron Boone.

Dan GrazianoESPN Staff Writer ,"This matchup was supposed to feature teams headed toward the postseason, but instead both are nearly out of the race. Now they're looking far ahead.",2017-12-10T23:45:54Z,espn,Cowboys-Giants was supposed to be a playoff decider. What happened?,http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/261061/cowboys-giants-was-supposed-to-be-a-playoff-decider-what-happened,http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1210%2Fr300899_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- If you were struggling to put your finger on what seemed off about this particular Dallas Cowboys-New York Giants game in December, the fact that it was being played while the sun was still up was a big part of it. Cowboys-Giants is supposed to be prime-time, network-TV gold. Not some run-of-the-mill, 1 p.m. ET start. Not in December.

What you need to know in the NFL

• Statistics

• Scoreboard

• 2017 schedule, results

• Standings

A year ago, this would have been a game about playoff seeding -- between two of the best teams in the league. And there's little doubt that if it weren't a Sunday night game, it would at least have been in a prominent, late-TV window.

But it was not, and if you've been following this NFC East season, you know why. The Giants have fallen apart completely, to the point where they just fired their coach and general manager with four games left to play, and six days later dropped a lackluster 30-10 home game to their once-fearsome rivals to fall to 2-11. The Cowboys? Well, their season is still breathing, but at 7-6, they're still on the outside of the NFC playoff hunt looking in. They need to keep winning and get some help, and as of 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, the other Week 14 results -- wins by Atlanta, Green Bay and Carolina -- were not helping.

""The situation we're in is a challenging one,"" Cowboys receiver Cole Beasley said. ""But guys aren't going to back down from that challenge. Those aren't the kinds of guys we have in this locker room.""

Dez Bryant had five catches for 73 yards and a touchdown in the Cowboys' win over the Giants on Sunday. AP Photo/Adam Hunger)

The Cowboys took a pretty memorable punch four weeks ago when they gave up eight sacks in an ugly loss to the Atlanta Falcons. It was the first game of star running back Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension, and the first of three straight losses for a Cowboys team that entered the season with Super Bowl hopes. The losing streak severely damaged Dallas' playoff chances (which stood at 1.9 percent as of Sunday morning, according to ESPN's Football Power Index), and it raised questions about whether the offense could function without Elliott. No one likes excuses, but star left tackle Tyron Smith missed that Atlanta game with an injury, and the Cowboys believe it took them a while to recover from the damage that did.

""Tyron was out, and the protection was a disaster,"" Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said. ""So that shook some of the confidence in it, and we've been slowly getting that back. That really set us back, because then everything is about protecting the protection, and your focus gets taken away for that, and it makes you defensive on offense. But I really feel we've kind of gotten through that cloud.""

The Cowboys' offensive focus Sunday was on hitting some big plays in the passing game -- an accomplishment that has eluded their run-first offense seemingly all season. Knowing the Giants and the way defensive coordinator/interim coach Steve Spagnuolo likes to call a game, they expected New York to blitz a bunch and come after quarterback Dak Prescott, and they were not disappointed. Prescott kept beating the blitz, and he hit enough big plays to make a difference. Dez Bryant caught a 50-yard touchdown. Rod Smith caught an 81-yard touchdown. Beasley had a 54-yard catch-and-run that set up another touchdown. Tied 10-10 at the half, the Cowboys busted it open and did their part, at least, to keep their season alive.

""We know where we are, we know what we've got to do and we're excited to get back to work next week and get after it,"" Prescott said.

The Giants, unfortunately, also know where they are. From a standings perspective, it's nowhere. The only team in the NFL with a worse record is the 0-13 Cleveland Browns, and the Giants just concluded a week that was all about public relations damage control. Out went coach Ben McAdoo and longtime general manager Jerry Reese, both the object of fan scorn all season. Back in at quarterback was Eli Manning, the beloved Super Bowl champion whose ham-handed benching two weeks ago prompted a fan reaction that ownership admits was worse than it expected. At the helm Sunday was Spagnuolo, the amiable, well-liked coordinator whose Giants glory days were a decade ago but who's still a fan favorite and a steadying hand for a difficult time.

""The building is in a better place right now,"" a Giants team source said during the week leading up to Sunday's game.

play 0:26 Cowboys' persistence helped get win Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett says his team was able to make plays late on both sides of the ball to finish strong against the Giants.

Still, they are playing out the string on a lost season, with no idea who their GM, coach or quarterback will be in 2018. If Cowboys-Giants a year ago was a potential playoff preview between two traditional NFC East powers, this December it has been reduced to ... well, this:

""We have some high-character guys on this team that are working hard every week, doing their absolute best to compete, and I appreciate that,"" Manning said. ""I appreciate the effort, the work, the enthusiasm to go win a football game. Again, we played hard today, we were right there in the mix against a good team, and we just don't have the firepower to finish these games.""

They do not. On Sunday, a Cowboys team that has lacked firepower for the past month had more than enough to roll the Giants, who were left to watch and tear another page off the calendar. These two teams don't meet again until the 2018 season, and by that time, it's very likely that neither will have played another playoff game and both will have undergone some changes. Prescott was asked something about going 0-2 against the Giants last season (when the Cowboys were 13-3) and 2-0 against them this season.

""I mean, it's a new team every year. Year in, year out,"" Prescott said. ""So I mean, it'll be a completely different matchup next year.""

We know that for sure. We just don't know how long it'll take the Cowboys and the Giants to make their way back to prime time.","dallas cowboysnew york giants

Referee John Hussey checks on Tom Savage. (Kevin M. Cox / The Galveston County Daily News via the Associated Press)

The Houston Texans’ handling of an injury to quarterback Tom Savage was called into question after video showed him striking his head against the ground and shaking as he lay disoriented on the field.

Savage, who appeared to spit up blood, came out of the game and entered concussion protocol, but initially returned to the field, replacing T.J. Yates on the team’s next possession.

Tom Savage hits head on ground, appears to have seizure while ref looks on, comes back in the game 5 minutes later. pic.twitter.com/gW9lYxDIwQ — TheRenderNFL (@TheRenderNFL) December 10, 2017

His appearance was brief, though. After the Texans went three-and-out (a 1-yard loss by Lamar Miller and two incompletions), he headed to the locker room and was declared out shortly after halftime.

He is now the sixth Texans player dealing with concussions. Tight ends Ryan Griffin and C. J. Fiedorowicz will miss the rest of the season because of them; running back Alfred Blue, wide receiver Braxton Miller and linebacker Jelani Jenkins missed the San Francisco game.

Because he is in the concussion protocol, Savage did not speak with reporters after Houston’s loss, but Chris Nowinski, the founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation and Boston University’s CTE Center, angrily tweeted that he was “disgusted” that Savage returned. “I would not let my worst enemy go through the 2017 #NFL sideline concussion protocol.” He continued that “the protocol is breached weekly. No one is punished. We pretend it didn’t happen.”

Disgusted that the @HoustonTexans allowed Tom Savage to return to the game after 2 plays after showing these horrifying #concussion signs (is that a seizure?) after a head impact. I would not let my worst enemy go through the 2017 #NFL sideline concussion protocol… https://t.co/PeJr5ISAIJ — Chris Nowinski, Ph.D. (@ChrisNowinski1) December 10, 2017

Wait for a response? Come on Kevin, the protocol is breached weekly. No one is punished. We pretend it didn't happen. The docs are supposed protect these men from severe brain injury & death. If they aren't required to watch the video before clearing them, NFL just doesn't care. https://t.co/3rRxyRZAzP — Chris Nowinski, Ph.D. (@ChrisNowinski1) December 10, 2017

As of the middle of November, the NFL said it had conducted 379 concussion evaluations (including preseason games).

“Those are just the amount of times that people were screened,” Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL’s Chief Medical Office, said in a briefing Nov. 14. “And to be clear, we want that number to remain high. We want to have a high bar set for screening. Our motto to all of our personnel on game day is if you see something, say something. We want anyone who has a concern to point it out, we want to be very aggressive in our screening.”

Concussions can be difficult to assess because symptoms can develop later and, as with Savage, NFL players do not want to come out of games. Ever.

After Savage was pulled, he tried to go on to the field and had to be forced back to the sideline and be ushered to the locker room. He said last week there's no way he's coming off the field on his own. Obviously, he wasn't happy, but the Texans made the correct decision. — John McClain (@McClain_on_NFL) December 10, 2017

Hiroshima survivor says ""we must not tolerate this insanity any longer""

(CNN) The winners of the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize have warned countries that possess nuclear weapons to eliminate their ""instruments of insanity"" or risk mutual destruction.

The stark warning came Sunday as this year's peace prize was presented at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway, to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

ICAN (International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons) campaigner and Hiroshima survivor, Setsuko Thurlow signs the Nobel protocol, during a press conference at the Norwegian Nobel Committee, in Oslo, Norway, Saturday, Dec. 9, 2017. As long as atomic bombs exist, a disaster is inevitable, the head of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, said Saturday.

""Heed our warning and know that your actions are consequential. You are each an integral part of the system of violence that threatens humankind,"" said Setsuko Thurlow, a Hiroshima survivor and ICAN campaigner.

Thurlow and ICAN's Executive Director Beatrice Fihn called on the world's nuclear-armed states to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - It’s perfect, isn’t it?

Starting pitcher Jack Morris and shortstop Alan Trammell together again.

This time, in Cooperstown.

Morris and Trammell were finally elected Sunday into the Baseball Hall of Fame, where they have belonged all along.

It doesn’t matter that they were elected by the Modern Era ballot and not the Baseball Writers Association of America.

They will be immortalized in Cooperstown, regardless.

Really, this is where they deserve to be when they first were eligible. It just took a lot longer for everyone to appreciate what they accomplished.

Morris, who came painfully close to entering the Hall of Fame in his 14th year on the ballot in 2013 with 67.7% of the vote, was hurt by the sabermetric and analytic crowd.

They paid too much attention to his career 3.90 ERA and not his 254 victories, staggering 175 complete games, and three World Series championships.

Trammell’s career was overshadowed by marquee shortstops Cal Ripken Jr. and Ozzie Smith, and never gained more than 41% of the writer’s vote despite his 2,365 hits, 185 homers and four Gold Glove awards.

“Time has made this even more special,’’ Morris said. “The older you get the more appreciative what it means. All the time wondering if this day would ever come is erased. It did come, and it’s amazing. I’m not sure I can put into words all of the emotions I’m going through.

“To go in with Alan Trammell is overwhelming for me. I can’t think of a better scenario of going with a former teammate than a guy that I respect and love so much.’’

Trammell, who spent his entire 20-year career with the Tigers, and 14 with Morris, was considered the equal of Smith, a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but wasn’t nearly as flashy defensively. He simply was consistent.

Now, after not having a Tigers player elected into the Hall of Fame since 1992, the Tigers have two players going into Cooperstown a quarter-century later.

Finally, the Tigers’ great 1984 team, which won the franchise's last World Series, is represented in the Hall of Fame.

“I think a lot of people in Michigan always wondered why a team so good, and so dominant, had nobody represent them in the Hall of Fame,’’ Morris said. “I’m trying to be as honest as I can. Tigers baseball is magnified after finally getting acknowledged from that great ’84 team.

“It gives me a sense of pride.

“It’s got to be a warm fuzzy day for Tigers fans.’’

Yes, indeed.

At a time where the Tigers are embarking on a significant rebuild, this proud franchise can take a bow.

Two of the greatest players to ever wear a Tigers uniform, who distinguished themselves with their incredible talent and ferocious style of play, this summer will receive baseball’s greatest honor.

Nobody will ever be able to take that away.","baseball writers association of america

Now it wants your children.,https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2017/12/06/facebook-already-won-the-war-for-your-mind-now-it-wants-your-children,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/12/alone-child-depressed-social.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Fashioning a noose from a scarf, 14-year-old Naika Venant ignored the pleas of Facebook Live viewers as she wrapped the makeshift hanging device from a shower rod, ending her own life. When the stream ended just over an hour later, all that remained was a lifeless body police found in the bathroom just feet from her sleeping foster parents.



Venant’s story is tragic, as are those of Ayhan Uzun, Katelyn Nicole Davis, Frederick Jay Bowdy, and countless others who attempted, or successfully committed suicide in front of a live audience.

Facebook denies any culpability. The social network promises it’s taking the situation seriously and pledges to hire more people. It’s also deploying AI created to seek out signs of dangerous behavior. Through technology or perhaps sheer force of will, Facebook plans to scour the platform’s dark corners — places known to house communities of pedophiles, rapists, and terrorists — in an attempt to prevent future loss of life.

In the mean time, families of the deceased would undoubtedly settle for eradicating the evidence of these macabre videos that still pop up from time to time, months later.

As with all suicides, extenuating circumstances are often at play. Mental illness, significant loss, or abuse are common themes that drive otherwise happy people to do the unthinkable. Facebook, to be clear, isn’t responsible for an individual in need of help that decides to take her own life.

But it’s certainly not helping.

Facebook and the fight for kids’ attention

Minutes after announcing a new app for children, you could feel the collective ire of the internet. Messenger Kids, set to debut December 11, is a stripped version of Facebook’s primary chat app. Unlike the version adults use, this one is built for those 13-and-under, kids who can’t, legally-speaking, create their own accounts.

At its surface, the app is innocent enough. Kids can send photos, videos, and instant messages (presumably) to other kids on the network. They can draw on their creations, add stickers, and enjoy most of what they’re already doing (illegally) on apps like Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram — all of which have explicit language prohibiting children under 13 from using them.

Language though, offers deniability.

Banning children under 13 from Facebook isn’t an attempt at taking the moral high ground. According to the Children’s Online Protection Act (COPPA), any website collecting information about its users is prohibited to do so with kids 13 and younger.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for what it’s worth, has continually spoken out against this sort of regulation. He once told CNN that “[dropping the minimum age] is a fight we’ll take on at some point.”

He later added:

My philosophy is that for education you need to start at a really, really young age. Because of the restrictions we haven’t even begun this learning process. If they’re lifted then we’d start to learn what works. We’d take a lot of precautions to make sure that [younger children] are safe.

You don’t have to be a cynic to realize Zuckerberg isn’t a great choice to babysit these kids.

Embrace the future

While Facebook has cemented itself as a digital titan in our current ecosystem, the future looks to be a very different place. For all the data Facebook collects on its users, there’s only one metric that matters to the continued viability of the world’s largest social network: its inability to attract teens.

While Blockbuster, Borders, and other mega companies once scoffed at those who foretold of their demise, Facebook is facing its uncertain future head on. It knows that without an influx of young users, its prospects for the future are rather bleak.

By indoctrinating those under 13 into the Facebook ecosystem through use of its new app, the social network hopes to groom the next generation.

We’ve seen this before, but this time its worse.

Taking a page from the playbook of beer and cigarette companies in the 80s and 90s, Facebook’s hope is that attracting kids will lead to brand loyalty as they mature. Or, perhaps it doesn’t care. Advertising to children is big business on its own, but the move pays double if it can create the sort of loyalty that keeps them around into adulthood.

Joe Camel, the illustrated spokesperson for Camel cigarettes reigned supreme for nearly a decade before legislators ultimately decided the cartoon nature of these, and other advertisements, constituted advertising a dangerous product to children.

The Camel wasn’t alone. Spuds MacKenzie started the child advertising debate almost a decade prior. Spuds, Budweiser’s bull terrier mascot, was retired in 1989 due to pressure from The Center for Science in the Public Interest, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and Sen. Strom Thurmond. The dog was later replaced with a trio of talking frogs, which met with the same fate. They, interestingly enough, were replaced with three lizards: because frogs are for children and lizards are for adults, obviously.

But while its motivations are obvious, Facebook’s newfound obsession with attracting an ever-younger audience is disturbing in ways that cigarette and beer companies couldn’t have even begun to understand. Rather than vying for transactional value, such as the purchase of Budweiser at the local grocery store or cigarettes at the bodega, Facebook isn’t attempting to sell your kids a dangerous thing; It’s attempting to sell them all the dangerous things, including the platform itself.

You’re the product

To detail all of Facebook’s criticisms, one would need a book deal and a few hundred blank pages. For the sake of brevity, we’re just going deal in what’s relevant when trying to understand why your children (and their data) will never be safe in the hands of Uncle Zuck.

After all, you can’t talk about Facebook without first mentioning the blatant disregard for its users. As the saying goes, “If you’re not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product.”

It may seem like a worthy trade: we suffer through a few ads to stay connected with family, watch viral videos, scope the latest memes, and rant about the customer service at that burrito joint around the corner. Advertisers get value from the network’s two-plus billion users while Facebook gets to keep the lights on and outfit Zuck in a never-ending supply of gray t-shirts. Facebook’s ad business isn’t appealing because of the size of its colossal userbase, but what the network knows about each of them — information it shares with those who purchase ads.

And, to put it mildly, Facebook knows a lot.

Even this, in and of itself, isn’t that bad. We willfully hand over this information; Zuckerberg just had the foresight to collect it and bundle it in a package advertisers were willing to spend money on.

Where the company runs foul is in how it uses this data.

There’s fake news. That’s an obvious place to start. While Facebook isn’t creating the news, it’s reaching those most vulnerable to it by tapping the insights afforded to those pedaling in this kind of garbage. It’s creating a new generation of non-thinkers, those who are significantly more likely to share a status update they agree with rather than one rooted in truth.

Or there’s a ProPublica report accusing Facebook of allowing discriminatory housing ads. After attempting to buy dozens of rental housing ads on the network, ProPublica asked that they not be shown to “African Americans, mothers of high school kids, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews, expats from Argentina, and Spanish speakers.”

All but one of the ads were approved within minutes. The one that wasn’t approved immediately sought to block the ads from those “interested in Islam, Sunni Islam, and Shia Islam.” That ad took 22 minutes to approve.

We raised similar questions with this practice ourselves, questioning the morality of displaying different versions of the “Straight Outta Compton” trailer to audiences of different races and ethnicities.

Worse, it’s still going on.

And then there’s arguably the most egregious thing Facebook has ever done with our data.

In a now infamous 2014 emotional manipulation study, the Zuckerberg brain trust set out to see if it could manipulate users by carefully determining what to place in their Newsfeed. Titled “Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks,” the study never asked for the consent of the more than 600,000 users whose moods it attempted to alter (both positively and negatively) by controlling what they were allowed to see while logged in.

Presumably, this isn’t the sort of information you’d willingly hand over about your kids.

Its best feature may be the ‘log out’ link

Humans, being social beings, thrive when they have strong, positive relationships with others. The idea that Facebook can connect us with more people, therefore increasing our feelings of inter-connectivity and thus producing happier humans is one way of looking at it. On paper, it checks all the boxes.

In practice, nothing could be further from the truth.

Research shows Facebook may have a detrimental value to human existence. It detracts from face-to-face relationships, increases sedentary behavior, erodes self-esteem, and could compound the affects of addiction. It creates feelings of envy, increased instances of stalking, divorce, and depression, and has a negative impact on both sleep and academic performance in students.

According to Harvard Business Review, speaking on the results of a Harvard study:

Overall, our results showed that, while real-world social networks were positively associated with overall well-being, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with overall well-being. These results were particularly strong for mental health; most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year. We found consistently that both liking others’ content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction.

Facebook isn’t an inherently evil company — at least we hope it isn’t. But playing fast and loose with its users’ mental health has severe consequences, consequences Facebook doesn’t seem to consider when finding ways to keep us engaged, mental health be damned.

Like all social networks, the goal is to keep users on the site and digging through content. The longer they keep us on the site (or app) the more ads they can force feed using intelligence we’re willfully giving away while consuming saidcontent. In this never-ending feedback loop social networks use gathered intelligence and industry insight to design platforms in a way that exploit the mind’s vulnerabilities.

Social networks are actively exploiting our weaknesses as a profit model meant to draw users ever-deeper into an ecosystem that’s slowly killing them — or at least killing their chance at happiness.

Tristan Harris, a Design Ethicist at Google, explains that this is exactly the type of exploits magicians use to delight an audience. They look for “blind spots, edges, vulnerabilities and limits of people’s perception so they can influence what people do without them even realizing it.”

Harris says:

Once you know how to push people’s buttons, you can play them like a piano … This is exactly what magicians do. They give people the illusion of free choice while architecting the menu so that they win, no matter what you choose. I can’t emphasize enough how deep this insight is.

Put simply, nothing on Facebook happens by accident. From the way menu systems are laid out to the illusion of choice when tagging friends in photos, nothing happens by chance.

You may believe these are conscious decisions. You control how often you pick up your phone (about 150 times a day, according to this study), and you may convince yourself that it’s a habit bred of boredom or curiosity. The truth is much darker than that. You’re an unwitting pawn in a game played between Facebook and its advertisers. As Harris says, you have a slot machine in your pocket waiting to reward each “spin” with subtle rewards. Only these rewards aren’t monetary, derived of physical pleasure, or chemical substances — although they reward your brain’s pleasure centers much in the same way.

Facebook is the new cigarette, but worse

As online babysitters go, Facebook is a pretty terrible one, all things considered. Yet thousands, perhaps millions, of parents willfully allow their child access to the social network even though the terms of service expressly prohibits lying about age to create an account.

A 2011 study detailed that 76 percent of the parents surveyed (of 1,007 households) allowed their children to create an account while younger than 13. Of them, 53 percent said they were aware Facebook had a minimum sign-up age and 35 percent believed the minimum age to be merely a suggestion. This raises real questions about the shortcomings of federal law, but also whether social networks themselves should shoulder more of the blame for not creating this sort of awareness — or doing more to actively enforce their own rules.

Maybe it doesn’t matter though. If Messenger Kids is any indication, the social network has plans for your children that disregard parental consent entirely.

And for a social network that’s proven to be a destructive force for adults, it’s hard to understand how we aren’t scrutinizing the decision to allow children to join before they fully understand what’s at stake. If Facebook and social media are responsible for our growing discontentment, imagine the consequences for a generation that never knew a world without it.

http://jdlm.info/about/,How many board configurations are there in the game of 2048? Let's try to enumerate them.,2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,hacker-news,The Mathematics of 2048: Counting States by Exhaustive Enumeration,http://jdlm.info/articles/2017/12/10/counting-states-enumeration-2048.html,http://jdlm.info/assets/2048/2048_improbable.png,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"So far in this series on the mathematics of 2048, we’ve seen that it takes at least 938.8 moves on average to win, and we’ve obtained some rough estimates on the number of possible states using combinatorics.

In this post, we will try to refine those estimates by simply counting every reachable state by brute force enumeration. There are many states, so this will require some computer science as well as mathematics. With efficient processing and storage of states, we’ll see that it is possible to enumerate all reachable states for 2x2 and 3x3 boards.

Enumeration of all states for the full game on a 4x4 board remains an open problem. I ran the code on an OVH HG-120 instance with 32 cores at 3.1GHz and 120GB RAM for one month, during which it enumerated 1.3 trillion states, which is a respectable half a million states per second, but that turns out to be nowhere near enough. At present, the best we we’ll be able to do on the 4x4 board is to enumerate all states for the game played up to the 64 tile.

Overall, the results show that the combinatorial estimates from the last post were substantial overestimates, as suspected. However, the state space for the full game is still very large. If a large nation state or tech company decided that 2048 was their top priority, which may not be the craziest thing that’s happened this year, I think they could probably finish the job.

The (research quality) code behind this article is open source, mainly in ruby and C++.

Counting States

Here a state captures a complete configuration of the board by specifying the value of the tile, if any, in each of the board’s cells. Our overall goal is to count all of the states that can actually occur in the game and no more. In the previous post, the estimates from (very basic) combinatorics counted many states that can’t actually occur in the game. By enumerating states systematically from each of the possible start states, we ensure that the states we count are actually reachable in play.

We also have some freedom in choosing which states are interesting enough to count. Because the game ends when we obtain a 2048 tile, we won’t care about where that tile is or what else is on the board, so we can condense all of the states with a 2048 tile into a special “win” state. Similarly, if we lose, we won’t care exactly how we lost; we can condense all of losing states into a special “lose” state.

Canonicalization and Symmetry

Many other non-interesting states that we’d like to avoid counting arise from the fact that some states are trivially related to each other by rotation or reflection. For example, in the game on a 2x2 board, the states

and

are just mirror images — they are reflections through the vertical axis. If we swiped left in the first state, it would be essentially equivalent to swiping right in the second. We can therefore reduce the number of states we have to worry about by treating these states as equivalent. In general, the number of such equivalent states is the number of elements in the dihedral group for the square, \(D_4\), which is 8. For the first state above, these eight states are:

In this diagram, which is called a cycle graph, ⤴ denotes a rotation counterclockwise by 90° and ↔ denotes a reflection about the vertical axis. The three states at the top are obtained by one or more rotations; for example, ⤴² means two rotations of 90°, which add up to a rotation of 180°. The four states at the bottom are obtained by zero or more rotations followed by a reflection.

When the tiles in a state are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, the number of equivalent states may be less than 8, because the symmetry means that some of the states in the above diagram will be identical. For example, the state has only four, because it is symmetric along the diagonal. However, particularly on 3x3 and 4x4 boards, states with symmetric arrangements of tiles are not so common, so overall we can expect to reduce the number of states we need to count by roughly a factor of 8 by choosing only one of these equivalent states as the canonical state.

States as Numbers

Which of the equivalent states should we choose as the canonical state? To answer this question, it will be helpful to think about states as numbers. We’ll also see that this has significant computational benefits in the appendices.

To write a state as a number, we can start in the top left and read the cells by rows; for each cell, we write a \(0\) digit if the cell is empty, and the digit \(i\) if the cell contains the \(2^i\) tile. For example, on a 2x2 board, the state would be written as the number \(2310\), because \(4 = 2^2\), \(8 = 2^3\), \(2 = 2^1\), and the last cell is empty.

Since we’re only interested in numbers up to 2048, which is \(2^{11}\), we could in principle write any state as a number in base 12 (rather than base 10, as we are accustomed to). However, because computers run on binary numbers, it will be more convenient to think of each state as a number in base 16 — that is, hexadecimal. The state above would therefore be more properly written as 0x2310 for computer scientists or \(2310_{16}\) for mathematicians.

To find the canonical state, we simply try all eight possible rotations and reflections, convert the resulting states to numbers, and then pick the smallest one. For our example state, , the candidates and their corresponding numbers are:

State Number 0x2310 0x3201 0x1023 0x2130 0x0312 0x1203 0x0132 0x3021

The state has the smallest number, 0x0132 , so that is the canonical state for . In general, this system for choosing canonical states tends to put tiles with larger values toward the bottom right corner.

Enumeration

Now we’re ready to start enumerating states — it’s all computation from now on. The idea is to generate all possible (canonical) start states, then for each one try each possible move, then for each move generate all possible (canonical) successor states. In code (ruby) form, the basic algorithm for enumerating states looks like this:

def enumerate ( board_size , max_exponent ) # Open all of the possible canonicalized start states. opened = find_canonicalized_start_states ( board_size ) closed = Set [] while opened . any? # Treat opened as a stack, so this is a depth-first search. state = opened . pop # If we've already processed the state, or if this is # a win or lose state, there's nothing more to do for it. next if closed . member? ( state ) next if state . win? ( max_exponent ) || state . lose? # Process the state: open all of its possible canonicalized successors. [ :left , :right , :up , :down ]. each do | direction | state . move ( direction ). random_successors . each do | successor | opened . push ( successor . canonicalize ) end end closed . add ( state ) end closed end

The code for generating start states is here, and the code for the rest of the State methods, such as random_successors and canonicalize , is here.

If we run this code for the game on the 2x2 board played up to the 32 tile, which we’ve previously established is the highest tile reachable on the 2x2 board, we get 57 states (click to enlarge):

In this diagram, each edge is a possible state-successor pair. For example, from the state , we could swipe left or right, which would result in a 4 tile, and then the game adds a 2 or 4 tile at random, which leads to , , or after canonicalization; or we could swipe up or down, which would leave the two 2 tiles unmerged and lead to or after canonicalization.

Not shown are the special ‘lose’ and ‘win’ states, so in total we have 59 states for the 2x2 game to the 32 tile. This compares favorably to the estimate of 529 states from the (simple) combinatorics arguments in the previous blog post. We’ve saved about one order of magnitude!

When we try to run this ruby code on the 3x3 or 4x4 boards, however, we quickly hit two problems: it’s very slow, and it runs out of memory for the closed set. I’ve included three appendices with the details of how to speed up the calculations and manage the large amounts of data involved, but first let’s see some results.

Results

The numbers of states for the various games we’ve looked at in this series of blog posts are:

Board Size Maximum Tile Combinatorics Bound Actual 2x2 32 529 59 3x3 1024 786,513,819 25,179,014 4x4 64 2,816,814,934,817 40,652,843,435 4x4 2048 44,096,167,159,459,777 \(\gg\) 1.3 trillion

Just like the 32 tile is the highest reachable tile on the 2x2 board, the 1024 tile is the highest on the 3x3 board. Exhaustive enumeration of states shows that the 3x3 game contains about 25 million states, which is a factor of 31 lower than the rough ‘Combinatorics Bound’ from the previous post. For the game on the 4x4 board to the 64 tile, which is the largest game on the 4x4 board that I was able to completely enumerate, the factor is even larger, at 69. As expected, the (very basic) combinatorics bounds were quite loose, because they count many states that can’t occur in the game or are trivially related to each other.

For the 3x3 game to the 1024 tile, there are too many states to draw a diagram like the one for the 2x2 game above. However, we can gain some insight into that 25 million figure by counting states in groups by (1) the sum of the tiles on the board and (2) the value of the maximum tile on the board. The sum of the tiles on the board increases by either 2 or 4 with each move , so the game generally progresses from left to right on this graph:

Early in the game, when the sum of the tiles is small, the number of states grows fairly smoothly and linearly with the sum of tiles. However, later in the game when the board fills up, there are sharp drops around where the sum of tiles reaches a larger power of two, for example at around sums 128 and 256. These drops indicate that the 3x3 game is tightly constrained by the small size of the board — there are not many ways to survive past these drops without merging most of the tiles together into a larger one.

It’s also notable that the same structure seems to repeat each time a larger maximum tile is reached (that is, each time the shade of blue in the plot gets darker). The 64, 128, 256 and 512 max tile curves each have a similar slope at the start and a ‘step’ at about 26,000 states per tile sum. In terms of gameplay, this repetition reflects the fact that once you merge most of the tiles together to get the next largest one, the board is mostly empty again, except for the newly merged tile, so the game sort of ‘resets’ at that point.

We might hope that the game on the 4x4 board would also show some of these characteristics, but at least up to tile sum 380, this is apparently not the case. After running the enumeration for one month and counting over 1.3 trillion states, the results to date for the full game of 2048 look like:

We see smooth and uninterrupted growth in the total number of states. Whereas the game on the 3x3 board topped out at about 80 thousand states per tile sum, the game on the 4x4 board shows no sign of slowing down at 27 billion states per tile sum .

We can still see the rise and fall in the number of states with each maximum tile value, and it becomes clearer if we unstack these counts and plot them on a logarithmic scale:

The top line in black shows the total number of states, summing over all the maximum tile values, which are again shown in shades of blue. Each blue arc shows the growth and later decay in the number of states with a given maximum tile value, as the game progresses. The bending down of the total (black line) shows that the growth in the number of states per tile sum tapers off as the game progresses, but the numbers are already quite large.

Conclusion

We’ve improved our estimates for the number of states in the game of 2048 on the 2x2 and 3x3 boards by one to two orders of magnitude, compared to the previous (basic) combinatorial estimates. The number of states for the game on the 4x4 board remains too large to enumerate in full, but we have at least managed to completely enumerate the states for the 4x4 game to the 64 tile, and we’ve made an attempt at enumerating the states for the full game.

The explicit enumeration of states counts only states that can be reached in actual game play, but even with that restriction there are still some surprising states included in the count. For example, in the last figure above, the arc that shows the number of states with at most a 32 tile does not stop until tile sum 348. There are four states with tile sum 348 and no 64 tile, one of which I chose for the cover image of this post:

It contains seven 32 tiles and seven 16 tiles arranged in a nice striped pattern that makes it very difficult to merge any of them. I find it quite surprising that it’s possible to play to such a state without losing, and indeed it seems quite improbable, especially if one is ‘playing well’.

In the next post, we’ll explore what it means to ‘play well’ in a rigorous way by modeling the game of 2048 as a Markov Decision Process and finding an optimal policy for the 2x2 and 3x3 games — that is, we will find a strategy for playing those game that we can show mathematically to be at least as good as any other possible strategy.

Appendix A: Bit Bashing for Efficiency

Profiling the ruby code above revealed that most of the time was being spent on state manipulation — for example, moving tiles, counting available tiles, and reflecting or rotating states to find canonical states. Let’s see how we can speed it up.

The hexadecimal numerical representation for states has a convenient property: for the 4x4 board, we need to store 16 numbers, where each number takes 4 bits, for a total of 64 bits. Now that we all use 64-bit computers, this is an auspicious number: the whole board state can fit into a single 64-bit (8-byte) machine word. For example, the 4x4 state (which is a winning state, because it has a 2048 tile)

would be written 0x022b013020100000 in hexadecimal, or more clearly with the addition of line breaks to make a 4x4 grid:

022b 0130 2010 0000

With the state represented as a 64-bit integer, we can also implement many common manipulations on states very efficiently using bit mask and shift operations, often without loops . For example, the C++ function to reflect a 4x4 board state horizontally looks like:

uint64_t reflect_horizontally ( uint64_t state ) { uint64_t c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 ; c1 = state & 0xF000F000F000F000ULL ; c2 = state & 0x0F000F000F000F00ULL ; c3 = state & 0x00F000F000F000F0ULL ; c4 = state & 0x000F000F000F000FULL ; return ( c1 >> 12 ) | ( c2 >> 4 ) | ( c3 << 4 ) | ( c4 << 12 ); }

While initially quite opaque, all this is doing is shuffling bits around. The role of first bit mask, 0xF000F000F000F000ULL , becomes clearer if we omit the 0x and ULL , which just tell the compiler that this is non-negative 64-bit integer in hexadecimal, and again add line breaks to make a 4x4 grid:

F000 F000 F000 F000

The binary representation of the hexadecimal digit F is 1111 , so the effect of this bit mask is to make c1 contain only the values in the first column of the board and zero bits everywhere else. The bit shift c1 >> 12 at the end of the function moves the first column 12 bits, which is to say three 4-bit cells, to the right, which makes it the last column. Similarly, c2 selects the second column, and c2 >> 4 moves it one cell to the right, and so on with the third and fourth columns to reverse the order of the columns.

Some functions take a bit more work to decipher. If you’re in the mood for a puzzle, here’s a function that counts the number of cells available (value zero) in a 4x4 state (you can find my explanation in comments here):

int cells_available ( uint64_t state ) { state |= ( state >> 2 ); state |= ( state >> 1 ); state &= 0x1111111111111111ULL ; uint64_t count = (( state * 0x1111111111111111ULL ) >> 60 ); if ( count == 0 && state != 0 ) return 0 ; return 16 - count ; }

Profiling (with perf) showed that such tricks made a big difference — compared to the obvious implementations with arrays and loops, these functions require very few CPU instructions and contain few or no branches, which allows the CPU to keep its instruction pipelines full.

Appendix B: Layers and MapReduce for Parallelism

The next challenge is that we can’t keep the whole closed set in memory. To break up the state space into manageably sized pieces, we can use the following property of the game: The sum of the tiles on the board increases by either 2 or 4 with each move. This property holds because merging two tiles does not change the sum of the tiles on the board, and the game then adds either a 2 or a 4 tile.

This property is useful here because it means that we can organize the states into layers according to the sum of their tiles. We can therefore generate the whole state space by working through a single layer at a time, rather than having to deal with the whole state space at once.

To parallelize the work within each layer, we can use the MapReduce concept made famous by Google. The ‘map’ step here is to take one complete layer of states with sum \(s\) and break it up into pieces; then, for each piece in parallel, generate all of the successor states, which will have either sum \(s + 2\) or \(s + 4\). The ‘reduce’ step is to merge all of the pieces for the layer with sum \(s + 2\) together into a complete layer, removing any duplicates. The pieces with sum \(s + 4\) are retained until the next layer, in which states have sum \(s + 2\), is processed, at which point they will be included in the merge. This may be easier to see in an animation (made with d3):

In the map step for each piece, it is feasible to maintain the set of successor states in memory. To make the merge in the reduce step efficient, we want the map step to output a list of states for each piece in order by their state numbers so we can merge the pieces together in linear time. Here Google again comes to our aid: they have released a handy in-memory B-tree implementation that plays well with the C++ standard template library. B-trees are most commonly found in relational database systems, where they are often used to maintain indexes on columns. They keep data in order and provide logarithmic time lookup and also logarithmic time insertion — much better than logarithmic plus linear time insertion into a sorted list — with relatively little memory overhead.

To break the state space up into even smaller pieces, which reduces the amount of work we need to do in each merge step, we can exploit an another property of the game: the maximum tile value on the board must either stay the same or double with each move. This property holds because the maximum tile value never decreases, and when it does increase, it can only increase as the result of merging two tiles — that is, even if you have for example four 16 tiles in a row and you merge them, after one move the result is two 32 tiles, not one 64 tile.

Together with the property above, this means that from a list of states in which all states have tile sum \(s\) and maximum tile value \(k\), the generated successors will all fall into one of four pieces:

Piece 1 2 3 4 Tile Sum \(s+2\) \(s+2\) \(s+4\) \(s+4\) Max Tile Value \(k\) \(2k\) \(k\) \(2k\)

There is a bit more bookkeeping to keep track of which pieces need to be merged together at each step, but it is basically the same idea. Here are the 57 states (excluding the ‘win’ and ‘lose’ states) for the 2x2 game to the 32 tile again, this time with the states grouped by tile sum and maximum tile value, here written \(s / k\):

For example, in the leftmost piece, both states have tile sum 4 and maximum tile value 2 . The transitions from that piece are to pieces with tile sum either 6 or 8 and maximum tile value 2 or 4 . Compared to the original diagram of these states without grouping, it’s also easier to see that you always transition to a state with a tile sum that is either 2 or 4 larger, like in the first post in this series.

Appendix C: Encoding and Compression

When working with billions or trillions of states, and each state takes 8 bytes, even fitting them all on disk is not trivial (or at least not cheap). To reduce the storage space required, and also the amount of input/output required, we can exploit the fact that the states are stored as sorted lists of integers — rather than storing each integer in full, we can store the differences between successive integers. These differences will generally be smaller than the integers themselves, so it is usually possible to store the differences in a smaller number of bytes. Using a variable-width encoding scheme to store the differences ensures that we use only the number of bytes we need.

For example, the list of states for the 4x4 game to the 2048 tile with tile sum 380 and maximum tile value 128 contains 21,705,361,721 states . At 8 bytes per state, that would be roughly 161GiB. However, with variable-width encoding, it takes only 35GiB — a compression factor of 4.6 — or about 1.7 bytes per state.

For longer term storage and transport over Internet, I also tried several compression programs on the variable-width encoded data. To evaluate the different programs, I used a smaller list of states with tile sum 260 and maximum tile value 32 ; it contained 30,954,422 states, which is about 1/700th the number in the 380/128 layer mentioned above, and it weighed in at 64MiB after variable-width encoding. For each of the programs, and for each of their supported compression levels, I measured the elapsed time for compression and the resulting compressed size using this smaller list of states.

Three programs emerged on the resulting Pareto frontier: Facebook’s Zstandard, Google’s Brotli and 7-zip. After scaling size and time up by a factor of 700 to estimate performance on the larger 380/128 layer, the frontier looks like:

Here closer to the origin is better; we see Zstandard performing best for relatively fast and light compression, and 7zip performing best for relatively slow and heavy compression. From the graph, we can see that Zstandard at compression level 11 is fairly close to the origin, and it turned out to minimize the particular linear cost function that I used. The results on the smaller layer suggested that Zstandard level 11 would reduce the 380/128 layer from 35GiB to about 10GiB. In fact, it did much better: it reduced it from 35GiB to 3.8GiB, for another factor of 9.2, or about 1.5 bits per state. I think that’s quite remarkable.

Rogue One was the first, and Solo is the next, but there are many other corners of the galaxy far, far away that demand to be explored on the big screen.

With Star Wars: The Last Jedi about to hit theaters, fans are very focused on the continued evolution of the Skywalker saga, but let's not forget that the standalone films -- or ""Star Wars Stories"" -- are also very much a thing. Rogue One was a hit, the young Han Solo film, Solo, is on its way, and Last Jedi director Rian Johnson is also working on a trilogy of films that is said to involve all new characters (whether or not these are considered part of the ""A Star Wars Story"" group remains to be seen).

Basically, there’s a vast appetite for more live-action adventures in the Star Wars universe even with tales that fall outside of the main saga. And while Disney and Lucasfilm may have rendered the Expanded Universe (the books, movies, games, etc. from before The Force Awakens) stories non-canon, the franchise still has an incredibly expansive mythology that’s only getting bigger.

Earlier this year, New Zealanders voted for the kea as their favourite bird, a cheeky olive-green parrot. Aussies have opted for a bird that's the enemy of cyclists, walkers and children everywhere.

The magpie has been selected as the bird of the year in a poll run by The Guardian, winning with 19,926 votes — 13.3 percent of the vote's total.

You wouldn't call the magpie a charming bird. It's known for its aggression, especially around mating season in late August to late October, and is notorious for swooping at people that cross its path.

Aside from that, perhaps there were more impressive birds that should've won the coveted prize — or nicer ones, at least.

Look, if there was one redeeming feature about the magpie, perhaps it'd be its rather pleasing call.

Australians appear to have a soft spot for the underdog (or bird, we should say). Coming in second place with 19,083 votes was the white ibis, famed for eating out of garbage bins and little else.

Next year, 365 long days will probably come and go without a new season of the Netflix smash hit Stranger Things, if the internet's daddy David Harbour has the right intel. The streaming giant confirmed that a Season 3 is in the works earlier this month — but it didn't specify exactly when the show would return with new episodes.

Harbour told Variety that the masterminds behind the series, the Duffer brothers, will probably need a ton of time to actually write the next season. Plotting out all the weird paranormal stuff and '80s homages that will take place in Hawkins, Indiana — and perhaps beyond — takes a ton of time and creativity, so there could be a longer wait than last year.

“I mean, one of the things that’s annoying for fans is that it takes us a long time to do them,” Harbour said in a Variety Studio interview.

“Like, you probably won’t get [Season 3] until sometime in 2019. But also part of the thing is, like any good thing, they need time. And those guys work so hard. I mean, they just sit in their apartment and write for 12, 14 hours a day.”

Next year will be a dark, liminal time for fandom. Everyone waiting to see who ends up on top in the final season of HBO's Game of Thrones is also probably out of luck, as star Sophie Turner let it slip in an interview that Season 8 probably won't be ready next year either.

So, we can look at this one of two ways: 2018 will be a frustrating purgatory for TV watchers everywhere, or 2019 will be extra special. Sitting here in 2017, it's hard to look on the bright side. Hopefully we can get back to the Upside Down sooner, rather than later.","hawkins indiana

Okay, maybe not anything, but we do know of one dog that ate 21 pacifiers and that should serve as a warning for pet owners everywhere.

SEE ALSO: You can now have matching PJs with your dog

A 4-year-old Shar-Pei named Dovey underwent surgery last week after his owners were concerned about how much weight he had lost over a short amount of time and brought him to see his long-time vet, KFOR-TV reported.

Hs family, based in Oklahoma, also had noticed Dovey stealing one pacifier from a countertop and separately throwing one up. An X-ray revealed the pacifiers were in Dovey's stomach:

Edmond veterinarian removes 21 pacifiers from dog's stomach https://t.co/6Z5lZKwfir pic.twitter.com/S6aQqWnx58 — KFOR (@kfor) December 8, 2017

But Dr. Chris Rispoli said he didn't expect there to be that many in there until he started the surgery.

“In 20 years, this is the craziest surgery I’ve ever done,” Rispoli told KFOR-TV. “They were pretty stunned because we thought there were seven to nine in there, and I pulled out 21.”

Rispoli shared the tale and images of the surgery in a post on Gentle Care Animal Hospital 's Facebook Page. Beware: Some of those photos are not for the faint of heart.

So fare warning, some people may find the following series of photos disturbing!! I have to show them for two reasons, first, this was the most fascinating and exciting surgery I have ever done or my staff has ever been a part of. We love Dovey, and she is doing GREAT post op. Dr. Dad (who incidentally sutured my forehead together last year when the leaf blower fell off the shelf in the garage onto my face!!!) and Mom recently had there second beautiful child but were having a missing binkie dilemma, then grandma saw Dovey jump up on a counter and take off with one. She recently had slowed down her eating and vomited a little phlegm for a few days but other than that was acting fine. When she vomited up a binkie, plus the story from grandma, dad brought her in for an x-ray. You can see the binkie’s stacked up in the stomach, we counted 7-9. Well......by the end of surgery we had pulled 21 out of her stomach. That is the second, and most important, reason I am sharing these photo’s. Dog’s will eat anything, anytime and at any age so always be watching!!! Thank Dr Dad and Mom for letting me share this with clients!!!

He ended with a short warning relevant to all dog owners: ""Dog’s will eat anything, anytime and at any age so always be watching.""

Dovey is OK, KRON-TV reported.","pictwittercoms6aqqwnx58

It purifies the air and will spruce up virtually any residence. But which houseplants make the best gifts?

Whether you're looking for a living room focal point or a cute little Instagram plant, you have a couple nice options. One thing to remember: unless you recipient is a Plant Master, you'll want to pick a plant that's fairly easy to take care of, lest you unwittingly give them the gift of murdering something beautiful.

And try to buy from a local greenhouse if you can! The plants there will likely be healthier than the ones you'll find online. It's worth sacrificing a little convenience.

1. Air plant

Air plants are small, cute, and pretty easy to take care of. All they require is some misting or a quick soak if the going gets tough. They don't even need soil!

Best of all, you could probably pull off transporting one in your carry-on if you really need to. Just be careful not to squish it.

I use it in the sense that my peace lily is absolutely sentient and has chosen to forgive me for forgetting to water it with alarming regularity. It looks great!

Give a peace lily to the person who's never kept a plant alive. It could be the confidence boost they need.

3. Aloe vera

The aloe vera plant is a type of succulent and, per the Old Farmer's Alamanac, has fairly straightforward care requirements. Give this one to your friends who forget sunscreen — the juice from the leaves can be used to soothe sunburns (and scrapes). They'll never buy those weird clear bottles of aloe again!

4. Snake plant

The snake plant is also a succulent, but unlike the aloe vera plant, it has large, slick-looking leaves and extremely good posture. It'll survive in pretty much any home, so your recipient's chances of success are promising. In fact, they won't even need to prune it — it grows that slowly.

What I'm trying to say is this plant is super chill, but also has its shit together.

Neil Patrick Harris posted a photo to Instagram Friday of his daughter Harper's most recent correspondence with the tooth fairy. Predictably, the letter is adorable — the seven-year-old announces that she has lost a tooth, then tells the tooth fairy, ""I love you because you rock!"" As someone who receives primarily Bed Bath & Beyond coupons in the mail (NOT a complaint), this sentiment has deeply moved me.

Harper also utilized a variety of crayons to create her masterpiece — a sign of carefully considered design. There's even a wonderful tooth drawing.

Hope you are doing great. Here's how not to advertise.

Wish, an e-commerce business that advertises heavily on Facebook (they're behind some of the, uh, weirder ads you may have come across), is under fire this week for its product images for plus-size tights. Rather than featuring photos of plus-size models, Wish is advertising the tights with photos of thin models stretching them across their entire bodies.

As several people on social media have already pointed out, the ads are obviously and egregiously tone-deaf. Wish implies that advertising a product incorrectly — that is, in a manner in which it will never actually be used — is preferable to featuring a plus-size person on its website.

I’m so pissed off, how is this an actual ad for plus size tights?? pic.twitter.com/J8S10hJ2Yp — kim ☀️ (@neverlandkim) December 8, 2017

Unfortunately, this isn't the first time Wish has made an advertising misstep (to say the least). The company, which often sells products cheaply, with slow shipping speeds, and directly from China, is infamous for serving users weird ads for products that are either inexplicable or offensive.

Earlier this week, the Daily Beast reported that the app TimeHop has received complaints from users who were served Wish ads for bizarre or disturbing products, including a dog collar for women and a sweatshirt covered in images of cocaine.

It's also not the first time a retailer has used thin models to advertise plus-size clothing. In April, the fast-fashion company Fashion Nova was criticized for using images of size two models to promote its plus-size line.","pictwittercomj8s10hj2yp

Ana Sandoiu,The phenomenon of 'ischemic preconditioning' helps to explain how an acute bout of exercise can have immediate protective effects against heart disease.,2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,How a single bout of exercise instantly protects the heart,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320311.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320311/320311_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"A new review of existing studies examines the evidence behind the idea that an acute bout of exercise is able to offer immediate protection for the heart against cardiovascular disease through a mechanism called ""cardiovascular preconditioning.""



An acute episode of exercise can 'train' the heart and protect it against future damage. An acute episode of exercise can 'train' the heart and protect it against future damage.

The results of the new research — led by Dick Thijssen, who is a professor of cardiovascular physiology and exercise at the Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom — have been published in the journal JAMA Cardiology.

As Prof. Thijssen and colleagues explain, it is a widely accepted fact that exercise protects the heart over time. However, it is less known that it can also do so within hours, and that a single workout episode is enough to yield clinically significant benefits.

This under-appreciated advantage of exercise may be due to a phenomenon called ischemic, or cardiovascular, preconditioning.

The team explains the reasoning behind the theory of cardiovascular preconditioning: repeatedly exposing the heart to short, non-life-threatening episodes of ischemia — an inadequate supply of blood to the heart — makes the heart more resistant to a more serious, future ischemia episode.

The ""paradox"" of ischemic preconditioning is a concept first introduced in the mid-1980s, and it has been suggested that one of the ways to induce this cardioprotective effect is through exercise.

So, the review by Prof. Thijssen and colleagues aimed to examine the evidence for this theory in existing preclinical studies.

Protection through exercise preconditioning

The review found that between one and three workout sessions per week can provide ""strong"" protection for the heart.

Moreover, one single workout episode can provide cardioprotection for 2–3 hours, and even stronger and longer-lasting benefits emerge 24 hours after the exercise session has finished.

""Importantly,"" the authors write, ""these associations are present on the first episode of exercise, with subsequent exercise sessions reactivating protective pathways and leading to ongoing beneficial effects.""

This cardioprotective effect could be explained by ischemic preconditioning, write the researchers, given that an intense episode of exercise can have systematic effects such as inducing myocardial ischemia.

Although factors such as obesity and age may interfere with some of these immediate protective effects of exercise, regular training can restore these benefits. The authors explain:

""Taken together, cardioprotection through exercise preconditioning is a facile, inexpensive, and potent therapy that deserves greater recognition and further resources to establish the optimal dose.""

""Nonetheless,"" they continue, ""as is so often the case with the benefits of exercise, its prescription follows the cardinal rule: use it or lose it.""

Prof. Thijssen comments on the results of the study, saying, ""This is a key review summarizing how a single bout of exercise can have a clear impact in keeping the heart adequately supplied with blood.""

""Firstly,"" he explains, ""this means that one bout of exercise can cause clinically relevant protection against cardiovascular disease.""

""Secondly,"" Prof. Thijssen continues, ""this means that benefits of exercise are present, even in the absence of changes in risk factors. These are both important and powerful messages for all who want to take up exercise.""

The team explains that the findings could be used to help cardiac patients through a procedure of so-called prehabilitation; an optimized dose of physical exercise in the days before a cardiac intervention may help to decrease in-hospital mortality and disease, they suggest.","liverpool john moores university

David Railton,"A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may significantly improve symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis, researchers report.",2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Multiple sclerosis symptoms improved with fruit and veg,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320302.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320302/320302_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Eating a healthful diet comprising fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may be linked with reduced disability and fewer multiple sclerosis symptoms among people with the condition, according to a new study published in Neurology.



Researchers say that a healthful diet may help to improve symptoms and disability for people with MS. Researchers say that a healthful diet may help to improve symptoms and disability for people with MS.

Back in July, Medical News Today examined the evidence for the Swank diet, developed in the 1950s as a treatment for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Proponents of the Swank diet believe that it can reduce the frequency of flare-ups and lessen the severity of symptoms related to the disease.

But the National Multiple Sclerosis Society state that there is not currently enough evidence to recommend any one diet as best for people with MS.

The author of the new study, Kathryn C. Fitzgerald — who works in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD — acknowledges that there is a lack of evidence on the potential influence that diet may have on MS symptoms.

""People with MS often ask if there is anything they can do to delay or avoid disability,"" explains Fitzgerald, ""and many people want to know if their diet can play a role, but there have been few studies investigating this.""

Severe disability reduced by 20 percent

To examine the role that diet may play in MS, Fitzgerald's team looked at questionnaires completed by 6,989 people with MS as part of the North American Research Committee registry.

As well as providing information regarding their lifestyle, weight, physical activity, and whether or not they smoke, the participants were asked whether or not they had had a relapse of MS symptoms in the past 6 months.

The participants also reported their level of disability and how severe their symptoms were for fatigue, pain, mobility, and depression.

Participants in the group that was considered to have the best diet ate an average of 1.7 servings of whole grains and 3.3 servings of fruits, vegetables, and legumes per day.

The participants in the group that was considered to have the worst diet ate an average of 0.3 servings of whole grains and 1.7 servings of fruits, vegetables, and legumes per day.

After adjusting the results for confounding factors — such as age and how long the participants have had MS — the team found that people in the group with the most healthful diet were 20 percent less likely to have more severe physical disability than people in the group with the least healthful diet.

The new study also reports that ""people with an overall healthy lifestyle were nearly 50 percent less likely to have depression, 30 percent less likely to have severe fatigue, and more than 40 percent less likely to have pain than people who did not have a healthy lifestyle.""

""While this study does not determine whether a healthy lifestyle reduces MS symptoms or whether having severe symptoms makes it harder for people to engage in a healthy lifestyle, it provides evidence for the link between the two,"" concludes Fitzgerald.

However, the participants in this study were mostly older white people who had been diagnosed with MS for an average of 20 years. This means that although people with all types of MS were included in the study, the findings might not apply to everyone who has the disease.

The authors confirm that another limitation of the study is that its design does not provide an insight into whether healthful diets influence MS symptoms in the future.","questionnaires

"Elaine K. Luo, MD",A look at how to make yourself burp. Included is detail on how burping works and the best strategies to force belching in order to relieve gas.,2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,How to make yourself burp: 7 ways to force a belch,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320276.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320276/320276_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Burping is one of the simplest ways to relieve bloating. It helps remove gas discomfort and can be triggered on demand.

Burping is also known as belching. It involves the release of gas from the digestive tract to the mouth. Burps occur when air is swallowed while eating or drinking and is then expelled.

The air that is released is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen.

Fast facts on how to make yourself burp: The inability to burp is uncommon, but some healthy people are unable to do it.

Burping can reduce gas and abdominal discomfort.

Most people experience gas after eating and release it through belching or flatulence.

What is the inability to burp?



Burping may help prevent abdominal gas, and reduce discomfort. Burping may help prevent abdominal gas, and reduce discomfort.

Not being able to burp happens when the upper esophageal sphincter temporarily loses its ability to release air.

The upper esophageal sphincter is a muscular valve surrounding the upper part of the esophagus (food pipe) just below the throat passage.

The sphincter muscle relaxes during swallowing, but the rest of the time, it contracts. When a person burps, the sphincter muscle needs to relax momentarily to allow air to escape.

It is important for the sphincter muscle to let go downwards for swallowing. It is also important that the sphincter muscle releases air upwards during burping.

Not being able to burp can make a person feel miserable. It may feel as if an air bubble is sitting at the sphincter muscle with no place to go. The inability to burp may be painful, and cause abdominal pain and bloating.

Methods to trigger burping

When triggered, burping can bring about relaxation and make a person feel better quickly.

1. Carbonated beverages

Soda, beer, and other carbonated beverages are bubbly and gassy. Drinking any carbonated beverage causes gas buildup in the stomach, triggers a burp, and relieves abdominal pain.

Sipping the beverage is not enough. It is important to drink a large amount quickly to force swallowing of more air and increase the chance of a burp.

2. Movement

Movement can put pressure on the air in the stomach and force it upward, potentially causing a person to burp. If a person is sitting, they should stand. If they are standing, they should sit. Lying down and quickly standing up is another option.

Other times, more action is needed. Walking, jogging, jumping up and down, or stretching may push air out of the stomach.

3. Eat gas-promoting foods



Apples and pears may build up gas in the stomach, creating pressure that may encourage burping. Apples and pears may build up gas in the stomach, creating pressure that may encourage burping.

Eating gas-promoting foods can help build up gas pressure in the stomach, resulting in a burp after consumption. Foods that may promote belching include:

some fruits, including apples, pears, and peaches

carrots

hard candy

chewing gum

whole grain bread

4. Antacids

Chewable calcium carbonate supplements, such as Tums and Rolaids, are designed to relieve acid ingestion. Burping is an unexpected side effect of antacids.

5. Forcing air

Forcing air into your throat is one way to get the sphincter muscle to contract.

First, suck in air into the mouth to the point of expanding the jaws and throat. A person should keep sucking air this way until an air bubble forms in the throat.

The next step is to block the mouth with the tongue by touching the top of the month with the tongue. Next, release the air by slowly lowering the tongue and parting lips.

6. Swallowing air

Swallowing air is another way to induce a burp, and it is easy to do. Exhale until the lungs are empty. Then breathe in deeply and hold for as long as possible. Exhale and inhale again, and swallow the air.

Drinking a glass of water or pinching the nose can make this even easier.

7. Triggering the gag reflex

Triggering the gag reflex can force a burp, but it should be considered as a last resort. A person can trigger a burp by touching the back of their mouth with a clean finger. The touch should be light and only enough to release air upwards.

The goal is only to burp, not to vomit. Too much force can cause vomiting, so it is important to be gentle.

Gas and bloating conditions

Most people pass gas up to 21 times a day, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

There are some health conditions, however, that cause people to experience gas and bloating more often. These people could benefit from triggered burping.

Lactose intolerance

Lactose intolerance is the inability to break down lactose, a type of sugar commonly found in milk and other dairy products. People with this condition may experience gas or bloating and struggle to burp at times.

Avoiding dairy can help to minimize symptoms, and inducing a burp may help when feeling bloated, gassy, and unable to burp.

Upper gastrointestinal disorders



Upper gastrointestinal disorders may prevent a person from burping properly. Upper gastrointestinal disorders may prevent a person from burping properly.

Many upper gastrointestinal disorders can either cause frequent burping, or the inability to burp. These include peptic ulcers , acid reflux, or gastroparesis. These conditions can benefit from some of the techniques to induce burping.

Peptic ulcers are sores that may develop in the food pipe, stomach, or small intestine.

Acid reflux is a disease where stomach acid irritates the lining of the food pipe. Symptoms include gas and bloating after eating that worsens with lying down.

Gastroparesis affects the stomach muscles and makes it hard to empty the stomach. It also affects digestion and causes bloating and a feeling of fullness even when a person has eaten little food.

Dysfunction of the belch reflex

Dysfunction of the belch reflex is rare, and most medical literature on it is not current.

One article in the medical journal, Gastroenterology, reported on a woman aged 25 who complained of debilitating chest pain resulting from upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction. She had a history of chest pain, including gurgling in her chest, and the inability to burp during pain episodes.

Studies on UES abnormalities and dysfunction do not specifically mention the inability to burp as a symptom, so it is hard to know the prevalence of this condition. Nonetheless, it is possible triggering the sphincter muscle could help to induce burping.

Dyspepsia

Dyspepsia is not a specific medical condition. Rather, the medical term describes a burning or gnawing feeling in the chest or upper abdomen, usually after eating.

Most people describe the feeling as ""gas,"" and other symptoms may include stomach rumbling, belching, or the inability to belch, and increased gas in the stomach or intestines. Causes of dyspepsia can be minor or severe.

Reducing gas, bloating, and burp problems

Anyone experiencing painful gas, bloating and problems with burping, can reduce these symptoms by:

avoiding gas-causing foods

drinking water before meals

eating and drinking slowly

avoiding smoking, chewing gum or drinking with a straw

avoiding artificial sweeteners, as these are known for causing gas.

Takeaway

While annoying, gas is a natural part of the body's digestive system. However, if gas or burping problems are painful or chronic, these concerns should be brought to the attention of a doctor, especially in people who have had previous surgery related to the stomach or digestive tract.","national institute of diabetes

Included is detail on the difference between akinesia and dyskinesia",2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,"Akinesia: Symptoms, causes, and treatment",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320291.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320291/320291_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Akinesia is a disease symptom that causes a person to lose the ability to move their muscles on their own. Sometimes a person's body feels as if it is ""frozen"" in time.

Doctors commonly associate akinesia with Parkinson's disease, which causes someone to lose control of their movements. However, there are other medical causes connected with akinesia.

Babies in the womb can experience akinesia, which in turn impacts their development. Movement is an important part of fetal development, and akinesia can affect growth and maturation in the womb.

Fast facts on akinesia: Akinesia is a condition that can occur at any age.

It is sometimes referred to as ""freezing.""

In Parkinson's disease, akinesia is usually a symptom of later stages.

What are the symptoms?



Symptoms of akinesia may include difficulty when starting to walk and muscle rigidity in the legs. Symptoms of akinesia may include difficulty when starting to walk and muscle rigidity in the legs.

Some of the symptoms associated with akinesia include:

Difficulty when a person starts out to walk somewhere.

Muscle rigidity, usually beginning in the neck and legs. Muscles in the face can become rigid, similar to a mask.

Sudden inability to move the feet properly, especially when turning or approaching a destination.

Not all people with Parkinson's disease have the same symptoms. Doctors often use the acronym TRAP to describe the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. These stand for:

T remor at rest

remor at rest R igidity

igidity A kinesia

kinesia Postural instability

A person with Parkinson's may display some or all of these symptoms. However, according to a study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, 47 percent of more than 6,600 people with Parkinson's disease who responded to a questionnaire reported akinesia or freezing as a symptom.

It is also possible that a person can experience akinesia on its own with no underlying signs of Parkinson's disease.

One such instance of akinesia is known as ""pure"" akinesia with so-called gait-freezing. This symptom does not have the other accompanying Parkinson's symptoms of resting tremors, generalized slower movements, or rigidity.

What is fetal akinesia deformation sequence?

Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) involves a type of akinesia that causes a combination of abnormalities in the womb when a baby is developing.

Examples of these symptoms include:

joint contractures

facial anomalies

intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)

underdeveloped lungs

According to the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, an estimated 30 percent of those with FADS are stillborn.

Others may not survive for long outside of the womb due to problems associated with their underdeveloped lungs.

Difference between akinesia and dyskinesia

Akinesia and dyskinesia are both symptoms that describe disorders in movement.

Akinesia is the absence of movement. A person with akinesia cannot move their muscles, even if they try.

A person with dyskinesia or difficulty in movement has muscles that move involuntarily and unexpectedly. Examples can include tremors or shaking or spastic movements, which can appear like sudden jerking movements.

Both symptoms can occur when a person has Parkinson's disease.

Risk factors for akinesia



Akinesia risk factors include Parkinson's disease and medication-induced Parkinson's-like symptoms. Akinesia risk factors include Parkinson's disease and medication-induced Parkinson's-like symptoms.

In adults, some of the causes associated with akinesia include:

Parkinson's disease : This results in reduced amounts of dopamine produced in the brain, affecting a person's ability to control their muscles.

: This results in reduced amounts of dopamine produced in the brain, affecting a person's ability to control their muscles. Medication-induced Parkinson's-like symptoms : Where a person takes too much of a medication that inhibits dopamine.

: Where a person takes too much of a medication that inhibits dopamine. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) : A gradual brain-damaging condition that usually first affects balance while walking.

: A gradual brain-damaging condition that usually first affects balance while walking. Hormone levels: Hypothyroidism or severely low levels of the thyroid hormone can result in akinesia.

In people with Parkinson's disease, men are more likely to have akinesia than women. Those who have a resting tremor as the predominant symptom of their Parkinson's disease are less likely to have akinesia than others.

Other risk factors include:

history of bradykinesia or slowed muscle movements

having Parkinson's disease for a long time

postural instability

problems with muscle rigidity

Potential causes of FADS include:

abnormalities in nervous system development

connective tissue disorders, such as chondrodysplasias

fetal edema

a history of maternal illness or drug use

Any changes or alterations in the womb that cause insufficient blood flow and oxygen levels to reach the developing fetus can result in fetal akinesia.

Genetic causes

Doctors have also isolated two gene mutations that are associated with increased risks for fetal akinesia.

If a person has a history of family members or babies with the condition, they may wish to see a genetic specialist. By doing so, they can be tested for the gene mutations DOK7 and RAPSN that are associated with akinesia.

Treatments

Treatment depends on what is causing the akinesis symptoms in someone. For example, medication-related akinesia can be treated by stopping taking the medication that is causing the problem.

Treatments for Parkinson's disease-related akinesia can be more complicated. Doctors will often prescribe medications that increase the amount of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the body or the activity it causes. These can help, as reduced levels of dopamine cause the neuromuscular symptoms that are associated with Parkinson's disease.

Examples of these medicines include levodopa and carbidopa, as well as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists.

When to see a doctor



Seeing a physical therapist to help work past ""freezing"" episodes may be recommended for people with Parkinson's disease. Seeing a physical therapist to help work past ""freezing"" episodes may be recommended for people with Parkinson's disease.

Seeking treatment for akinesia is necessary as having the symptoms increases the likelihood of a person falling. This can lead to bone breakages and other injuries.

People with Parkinson's disease or other disorders may wish to see a physical therapist, who can help them learn to work past ""freezing"" episodes and try to continue moving in a safer way whenever possible.

Currently, there are no treatments for PSP or fetal akinesia other than supportive care. However, support could include help with breathing for babies born with akinesia whose lungs are not well developed or working fully.

Takeaway

Akinesia is a difficult symptom to experience for anyone whatever their age. Losing the ability to engage in controlled movements can be devastating for a person with Parkinson's disease or another underlying disorder that causes this to happen.

If a person starts displaying akinesia or any other related symptoms, they should talk to their doctor. Sometimes a person with Parkinson's disease can have acute episodes of akinesia that can be treated for a short time to reduce sudden attacks.

In others cases, akinesia can represent the progression to more severe Parkinson's disease forms or pure akinesia from something other than Parkinson's disease.","journal of neurology neurosurgery psychiatry

""Lie bumps"" is the common name for transient lingual papillitis. People used to believe that these bumps appeared on a person's tongue when they lied. While this superstition is long forgotten, the name has stuck.

This article explores the potential causes of lie bumps and how they might be treated.

What are lie bumps?

Transient lingual papillitis is a short-term condition that affects the tongue.

When a person has lie bumps, small red or white bumps appear on their tongue. These swollen bumps may cause some pain and discomfort.

A 2017 study notes that while this type of tongue bump may be painful, it is common and passes quickly. Lie bumps usually go away without treatment after 2 or 3 days.

Symptoms



Lie bumps, or transient lingual papillitis, are small bumps that appear on the surface of the tongue. Lie bumps, or transient lingual papillitis, are small bumps that appear on the surface of the tongue.

Some people describe lie bumps as looking like pimples on the tongue. They may feel:

uncomfortable

painful

swollen

itchy

tingly

Other than pain or irritation from the bumps themselves, people do not usually have any other accompanying symptoms.

Transient lingual papillitis vs. eruptive lingual papillitis

If a person is experiencing additional symptoms, they may have another condition called eruptive lingual papillitis.

The bumps on the tongue in eruptive lingual papillitis may look the same as lie bumps, or transient lingual papillitis.

Eruptive lingual papillitis differs from transient lingual papillitis in the following ways:

it may last for up to 2 weeks

it may be caused by a virus

it is a contagious condition

it may cause swollen glands

it may be accompanied by a fever

it is more common in children than adults

Causes



Spicy or hot food may cause transient lingual papillitis. Spicy or hot food may cause transient lingual papillitis.

According to a 2003 study, transient lingual papillitis is considered an inflammatory disease. The underlying causes of the condition remain unclear. A 2016 study explains that while the condition is poorly understood, it is not harmful to an individual.

While more research is needed to understand the causes of transient lingual papillitis, the following are thought to play a role:

diets high in acidic foods or sugar

spicy foods

stress and inflammation

biting the tongue

burning the tongue

digestive problems

food allergies

It is thought that lie bumps occur when small fleshy papillae on the tongue become irritated. The papillae are where the taste buds are, and when they get irritated, they may swell and form bumps.

Treatment

Lie bumps usually go away on their own after 2 or 3 days. To help treat symptoms and resolve the condition quickly, a person can try:

avoiding acidic or spicy foods

rinsing the mouth with salt water

brushing the teeth after every meal

using mouthwash to reduce mouth bacteria

using an over-the-counter topical treatment

When to see a doctor



Persistent lie bumps that reoccur frequently should be inspected by a doctor. Persistent lie bumps that reoccur frequently should be inspected by a doctor.

It is a good idea to see a dentist or doctor if the lie bumps:

do not go away on their own after a week

frequently come back

are very painful

bleed when touched

A doctor or dentist can usually diagnose lie bumps by looking at them. If they think the bumps may be caused by something else, they will perform other diagnostic tests.

Other causes of bumps on the tongue

If bumps on the tongue are not caused by transient or eruptive lingual papillitis, then another condition may be the cause.

Other potential causes of bumps on the tongue include:

Human papillomavirus (HPV) : This is a viral infection that is spread by skin-to-skin contact. It causes warts and may affect the genitals, mouth, or throat.

: This is a viral infection that is spread by skin-to-skin contact. It causes warts and may affect the genitals, mouth, or throat. Canker sores : These are painful, red sores that can occur anywhere in the mouth. They are not contagious and normally get better without treatment within 10 days.

: These are painful, red sores that can occur anywhere in the mouth. They are not contagious and normally get better without treatment within 10 days. Syphilis : An early sign of this sexually transmitted infection is a sore that may appear in the mouth.

: An early sign of this sexually transmitted infection is a sore that may appear in the mouth. Scarlet fever : One of the symptoms of this bacterial infection is the appearance of red bumps on the tongue.

: One of the symptoms of this bacterial infection is the appearance of red bumps on the tongue. Mouth cancer : Although rare, lumps on the tongue that are grey, pink, or red and bleed when touched may be cancerous. Mouth cancer may appear on the side of the tongue, rather than the top.

: Although rare, lumps on the tongue that are grey, pink, or red and bleed when touched may be cancerous. Mouth cancer may appear on the side of the tongue, rather than the top. Traumatic fibroma : This is a smooth, pink growth on the tongue. It is caused by chronic irritation and may need to be surgically removed.

: This is a smooth, pink growth on the tongue. It is caused by chronic irritation and may need to be surgically removed. Lymphoepithelial cysts: These are soft yellow cysts that may appear under the tongue. They are normally harmless, and their cause is unknown.

Outlook

Lie bumps are not usually a cause for concern and tend to go away on their own after 2 or 3 days.

A person should speak to a doctor if the bumps on the tongue do not go away after a week, frequently recur, bleed when touched, or are very painful.

A doctor can help determine the cause of the bumps, most of which are not harmful. If the cause is an underlying medical condition, a doctor can help a person access the right treatment.","lingual papillitis

Menopause can cause physical and emotional changes that impact a woman's life, including her sex life.

Some symptoms and side effects associated with menopause include:

anxiety

bladder control issues

decreased sex drive and desire (libido)

depression

difficulty sleeping

thinning hair

weight gain

Each of these effects can impact a woman's quality of life and relationship with her partner.

Menopause and libido



Menopausal symptoms can have a negative effect on a woman's relationship with her partner. Menopausal symptoms can have a negative effect on a woman's relationship with her partner.

Libido refers to sexual interest and sexual enjoyment.

Some women going through menopause report reduced libido, but the causes vary from person to person.

According to one review, the reported rates of sexual problems in postmenopausal women are between 68 and 86.5 percent.

This range is much higher than in all women in general, which is estimated to be between 25 and 63 percent.

Why does menopause affect libido?

Decreased estrogen levels can result in reduced blood flow to the vagina, which can cause the tissues of the vagina and labia to become thinner. If this happens, they become less sensitive to sexual stimulation.

Decreased blood flow also affects vaginal lubrication and overall arousal. As a result, a woman may not enjoy sex as much and may have difficulty achieving orgasm. Sex may be uncomfortable or even painful.

Fluctuating hormone levels during perimenopause and menopause can also affect a woman's mental health, which in turn, may cause a decrease in her libido.

Stress can also impact a woman's libido, as she may be juggling a job, parenting, and be caring for aging parents. The changes in hormone levels a woman may experience during menopause may make her irritable or depressed, so dealing with everyday stress may feel more difficult.

According to an article published in the Journal of Women's Health, women who have more significant side effects associated with menopause are more likely to report lower libido levels.

Examples of these side effects include hot flashes, depression, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and fatigue.

Other factors that make a woman going through menopause more likely to experience a reduced libido include:

history of chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or depression

history of smoking

engaging in low levels of physical activity

A woman should talk to her doctor about how these conditions could affect her sex drive.

Tips for improving libido

There are several steps a woman can take to increase her libido. These include medical treatments, lifestyle changes, and home remedies.

Medical treatments



Spending time together on shared hobbies, exercising, and planned dates will help increase a couple's intamacy. Spending time together on shared hobbies, exercising, and planned dates will help increase a couple's intamacy.

If a woman experiences changes to her vaginal tissue, such as thinning and dryness, she may wish to consider estrogen therapy.

Prescription estrogen can be applied directly to the vagina in the form of creams, pills, or vaginal rings. These usually contain lower doses of estrogen than regular birth control pills.

Some women may wish to take estrogen pills that contain higher levels of hormones. This treatment, known as hormone replacement therapy, might help reduce symptoms, such as hot flashes and mood changes, but may also carry risks.

A woman thinking about hormone replacement therapy should discuss it with her doctor before starting to take any medication.

One study found that women using hormone therapies reported higher levels of sexual desire compared with women who did not.

Less commonly, a doctor may prescribe testosterone therapy. However, not all women respond to this treatment, and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not approve it for treating sexual disorders in women.

A woman may not experience any changes in her sex drive after using estrogen or testosterone therapies.

A woman may also choose to see a therapist who specializes in sexual dysfunction or enhancing sex. Sometimes, couples may want to attend therapy together.

Lifestyle changes

Some women may benefit from using water-soluble lubricants during sex. These can be purchased over-the-counter at most drugstores.

However, women should avoid non-water soluble and silicone-based lubricants, as these can break down condoms used to protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Increasing physical activity, such as getting 30 minutes or more of exercise on a routine basis, may help reduce menopause-related symptoms, including a low libido. Eating a healthful diet can also enhance a person's overall sense of well being.

Changing sexual habits

There are many ways a person can foster a sense of intimacy with their partner, including:

Changing sexual routines : Try spending extended periods on foreplay, use vibrators or other sex toys to enhance an intimate experience, or engage in sexual activity or touching without the goal of orgasm.

: Try spending extended periods on foreplay, use vibrators or other sex toys to enhance an intimate experience, or engage in sexual activity or touching without the goal of orgasm. Relieving stress together : There are many stress-relieving techniques a couple can do outside of the bedroom to increase intimacy.

: There are many stress-relieving techniques a couple can do outside of the bedroom to increase intimacy. Examples include going on planned dates together, taking a walk, or spending time doing hobbies together, such as exercise, crafts, or cooking. Practicing masturbation: Spending time alone and exploring what types of touch and sexual stimulation work well for an individual can help them talk to a partner about their needs and preferences. It can also help a person feel more comfortable with sexual activity without the pressure of a partner.

Natural remedies

Some women use natural supplements to try to increase their libido. It is important to keep in mind that the FDA do not regulate herbs and supplements, so women should be sure to choose a reputable brand.

Some natural remedies used to increase libido in women include:

black cohosh

red clover

soy

A woman should discuss these remedies with a doctor before taking them to ensure they will not interact negatively with other prescriptions and supplements she may be taking. Soy contains estrogen, so it may react with other estrogen therapies.

When to see a doctor

A woman should speak to her doctor whenever perimenopause or menopause is having a significant impact on her day-to-day activities, including sexual activity.

Sometimes, a doctor can recommend changes in health habits as well as discuss whether prescription medications may help relieve the symptoms, including a low libido.

Speaking with a doctor can also rule out any other underlying medical conditions that may cause a reduced libido. These conditions include urinary tract infections, uterine prolapse, endometriosis, or pelvic floor dysfunction.

Outlook



A doctor will be able to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for a reduced sex drive. A doctor will be able to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for a reduced sex drive.

While some women do experience a decreased libido in menopause, others do not.

Some women may even experience a heightened libido after menopause. This can be due to reduced stresses over pregnancy and fewer child-rearing responsibilities.

If a woman's libido is impacted after menopause, she should talk to her doctor about treatments that could enhance her quality of life.","journal of womens

They may result in bone tumors.,2017-12-09T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,What are bone lesions? Causes and symptoms,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320273.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320273/320273_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Bone lesions are areas of bone that are changed or damaged. Causes of bone lesions include infections, fractures, or tumors.

When cells within the bone start to divide uncontrollably, they are sometimes called bone tumors.

Most bone lesions are benign, meaning they are not cancerous. Some bone lesions are cancerous, however, and these are known as malignant bone tumors.

What are bone lesions?



Bone lesions are a masses of tissue that can form in any part of the bone. Bone lesions are a masses of tissue that can form in any part of the bone.

Bone lesions can affect any part of the body and develop in any section of bone, from the surface to the bone marrow in the center.

They are caused by cells in the bone that start to divide and multiply uncontrollably, leading to a lump or mass of abnormal tissue.

A growing lesion can destroy healthy tissue and weaken the bone, making it more vulnerable to fractures.

Most bone lesions are benign, not life-threatening, and will not spread to other parts of the body.

Some bone lesions, however, are malignant, which means they are cancerous. These bone lesions can sometimes metastasize, which is when the cancer cells spread to other parts of the body.

Malignant bone tumors are divided into two types:

Primary bone cancer , which is cancer that starts in the bone.

, which is cancer that starts in the bone. Secondary bone cancer, which is when cancer starts somewhere else and spreads to the bone.

Causes and treatment

The cause of a bone lesion depends on whether it is benign or cancerous, in addition to other factors.

Benign bone lesions

Most bone lesions are benign, meaning they are not cancerous or life-threatening. There are also some diseases and conditions that resemble bone lesions.

Causes of benign bone lesions include:

non-ossifying fibroma

unicameral (simple) bone cyst

osteochondroma

giant cell tumor

enchondroma

fibrous dysplasia

chondroblastoma

aneurysmal bone cyst

osteoid osteoma

If the lesion is benign, a doctor may recommend a period of monitoring with regular X-rays. Some lesions, especially those in children, may disappear over time.

Other bone lesions can be treated successfully with medications. In some cases, it may be necessary to surgically remove the lesion to reduce the risk of a bone fracture.

Benign lesions may come back after treatment. in rare cases, they may spread or become malignant.

Malignant bone tumors

Causes of malignant bone tumors or cancerous bone lesions depend on whether the cancer is primary or secondary.

The most common causes of primary bone cancer lesions are:

Multiple myeloma



Multiple myeloma usually affects those over the age of 50, and is the most common form of primary bone cancer. Multiple myeloma usually affects those over the age of 50, and is the most common form of primary bone cancer.

Multiple myeloma is a malignant tumor of the bone marrow, which is the soft tissue in the middle of bones responsible for producing blood cells.

It can affect any bone in the body and is the most common primary bone cancer, affecting about six people per 100,000 every year. Most people who get multiple myeloma are between 50 and 70 years old.

Multiple myeloma is usually treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Occasionally, surgery may be required.

The 5-year survival rate for multiple myeloma is 49 percent. That means that just under half of people diagnosed with the condition will be alive 5 years after diagnosis.

Osteosarcoma

Osteosarcoma is the second most common primary bone cancer. It is still rare, occurring in between two and five people in every million each year.

Most cases of osteosarcoma are seen either side of the knee in the thighbone or shinbone of teenagers and children. It can also sometimes occur in the hip or shoulder.

Treatment usually involves chemotherapy and surgery. The 5-year survival rate is 70 percent for children and young people with osteosarcoma in one location when they are diagnosed.

The usual treatment options for osteosarcoma are chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation.

Ewing sarcoma

Children and young people between the ages of 5 and 20 are most likely to experience Ewing sarcoma.

The upper and lower leg, pelvis, upper arm, or ribs tend to be the bones affected by this type of tumor. It can also develop in the soft tissue surrounding a bone.

While Ewing sarcoma can develop at any age, more than half of those diagnosed with it are between 10 and 20 years old.

The overall 5-year survival rate for children and young people with Ewing sarcoma that has not spread is about 70 percent. If the tumor has already spread at the time of diagnosis, the prognosis is not as good.

Chondrosarcoma

Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor made up of cells that produce cartilage. It is seen mainly in people between 40 and 70 years of age. These tumors tend to develop in the hip, pelvis, or shoulder area.

Chondrosarcoma is usually treated with surgery,but the type of operation needed will depend on the stage and severity of the cancer.

During limb-sparing surgery, the affected part of the bone is removed and replaced with either a metal replacement or bone graft.

Occasionally, if the cancer cells have spread from the bone into nerves and blood vessels, the affected area may need to be amputated.

Chondrosarcoma is slow-growing cancer, and most cases are low grade when diagnosed.

Secondary bone cancer lesions

Types of cancer that begin elsewhere in the body and can spread to bone include:

breast

lung

thyroid

renal

prostate

In the case of secondary bone cancer that has spread from elsewhere, the treatment options and outlook will depend on the type and severity of the primary cancer.

Symptoms



The symptoms of bone lesions may include dull pain, stifness, and swelling in the affected area. The symptoms of bone lesions may include dull pain, stifness, and swelling in the affected area.

Sometimes, bone lesions can cause pain in the affected area. This pain is usually described as dull or aching and may worsen during activity. The person may also experience fever and night sweats.

In addition to pain, some cancerous bone lesions can cause stiffness, swelling, or tenderness in the affected area. The pain may come and go and may be worse or better at night.

Not all people will experience these symptoms but may instead notice a painless mass somewhere on their body.

Bone lesions can weaken the bone tissue, making it vulnerable to fractures. Therefore, a person with a bone lesion may break a bone without having any injury.

Diagnosis

A doctor will carry out a full physical assessment and several tests to diagnose the cause of a bone lesion. They might ask about general health, medications, and symptoms, as well as any family history of lesions or cancer.

During a physical examination, a doctor will look for swelling or tenderness, any changes in the skin, the presence of a mass, and if there is any effect on nearby joints.

They will also order imaging tests, which can include X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, or computed tomography (CT) scans.

A biopsy may also be needed to make a diagnosis. During a biopsy, a small sample of the lesion will be removed for examination under a microscope. Blood and urine tests may also be taken.

Outlook

The outlook for people with a bone lesion will depend on the kind of bone lesion they have.

Benign lesions may only require watchful waiting or treatment with medications, though they may return after successful treatment.

People with malignant bone lesions will need to visit their doctor regularly, usually every few months, after treatment and be monitored for signs of recurrence.","nonossifying fibroma unicameral simple bone cyst osteochondroma

"Seunggu Han, MD",A subdural hematoma occurs when a vein located beneath the skull ruptures and starts to bleed. It can be life-threatening and requires immediate attention.,2017-12-09T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,"Subdural hematoma: Definition, treatment, and outlook",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320259.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320259/320259_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"A person with a head injury requires immediate medical attention. Although a person may not initially feel as if much is wrong, bleeding can occur within the skull. Internal bleeding can lead to serious consequences, including brain damage and death.

One type of internal bleeding in the skull is called subdural hematoma. People should be aware of the signs and symptoms of head trauma and seek treatment immediately if they or someone around them experience a head injury.

What is a subdural hematoma?



Subdural hematomas are the result of head injuries where the blood collects between the surface of the brain and the skull. Subdural hematomas are the result of head injuries where the blood collects between the surface of the brain and the skull.

A subdural hematoma occurs when a vein located beneath the skull ruptures and starts to bleed. The blood collects between the brain and the skull. As this space begins to fill with blood, the increasing pressure causes some of the symptoms of subdural hematoma.

Subdural hematoma bleeding occurs in one of the layers of tissue between the brain and the skull called the meninges. The outermost layer is called the dura.

If pressure continues to build against the brain, a subdural hematoma may lead to long-term health problems or life-threatening situations. In the worst case scenarios, untreated subdural hematomas can lead to unconsciousness or death.

Subdural hematomas are a result of injury to the head. The severity of the injury determines how the subdural hematoma will be categorized.

There are two types of subdural hematomas: acute and chronic.

Acute subdural hematoma

A subdural hematoma caused by a severe head injury is considered acute. Likely causes may include car accidents or a fall from a height.

Cases of acute subdural hematoma are often harder to treat and more likely to lead to long-term consequences or death. The risk of death from an acute subdural hematoma is more than 50 percent.

Chronic subdural hematoma

Chronic cases of subdural hematoma are either due to repeated or mild head injuries.

Older adults are more likely to develop chronic subdural hematoma due to increased frequency of falls.

Older adults are also at higher risk because a person's brain shrinks as they age, and this shrinkage causes the tiny veins on the surface of the brain to stretch, making them more vulnerable to tearing

While chronic subdural hematomas are easier to treat, there is still the risk of death or long-term health consequences.

Symptoms

The symptoms of subdural hematoma can vary from person to person. Common symptoms include:

severe headache

change in mood or behavior

seizures

slurred speech

loss of consciousness or passing out

apathy

weakness

vision problems

dizziness

vomiting

confusion

Symptoms of an acute subdural hematoma occur quickly following the injury. In cases of chronic subdural hematoma, symptoms are more likely to develop slowly or may not develop at all.

The symptoms occur at different rates due to the speed at which blood starts to pool and put pressure on the brain.

In cases of chronic subdural hematoma, small veins on the outer surface of the brain may tear. The tears cause bleeding in the subdural layer of tissue. In these cases, symptoms may not appear for several days or even weeks.

Other factors may influence a person's symptoms. A person's age or other medical conditions both play a role in how quickly symptoms start to develop.

Causes



Warfarin and other blood thinners may increase the chances of developing a subdural hematoma. Warfarin and other blood thinners may increase the chances of developing a subdural hematoma.

The most common cause of a subdural hematoma is a severe injury to the head. Minor head injuries are a less common cause and more typical in older people.

Sometimes, subdural hematomas may occur spontaneously as a result of another medical condition.

Risk factors that increase a person's chances of developing subdural hematoma include:

blood thinners, such as warfarin or aspirin

medical conditions that cause blood clotting issues

long-term alcohol use or abuse

repeated head injuries, such as from falls or sports

very young or very old age

Diagnosis

It is important to diagnose cases of acute subdural hematoma quickly so treatment can begin immediately. Rapid treatment may minimize the risk of death or long-term effects.

Cases of chronic subdural hematoma may be more difficult to diagnose, as symptoms do not develop rapidly or may not have an obvious cause.

To diagnose subdural hematoma, a doctor will usually use computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to get a clear picture of the brain. The doctor will examine the scan for signs of bleeding.

If the doctor identifies bleeding, they will determine the source of the bleeding and develop a plan of action to address the issue.

The doctor may also check a person's blood pressure and heart rate, as well as order blood work to get blood cell and platelet counts. These screenings and tests are designed to look for internal bleeding and blood loss.

Treatment



Surgery is generally carried out to remove the blood clot and any leaked blood. Surgery is generally carried out to remove the blood clot and any leaked blood.

A person with a subdural hematoma will usually require surgery. For acute cases, the person will likely undergo a craniotomy.

During this procedure, a surgeon first removes a portion of the person's skull near the site of the subdural hematoma. The surgeon will then remove the clot and will then use suction and irrigation techniques to remove any leaked blood.

A craniotomy is a risky procedure. In some circumstances, however, it necessary to save a person's life.

For chronic subdural hematomas or when an acute hematoma is smaller than 1 cm in diameter, a surgeon may use burr hole surgery. During this procedure, the surgeon drills a small hole into the person's skull and inserts a rubber tube to drain the blood.

After surgery, a doctor will usually prescribe anti-seizure medication. A person may need to take the drugs for several months or years. Taking these medications can help prevent a seizure that could cause another subdural hematoma.

Doctors typically prescribe medications to help reduce swelling around the brain, which may help prevent or reduce pressure in the skull in the days following surgery.

Recovery

Recovery times vary greatly between individuals. The speed of recovery often depends on the extent of damage the subdural hematoma has caused to the brain.

Only between 20 and 30 percent of people can expect to see a full or nearly full recovery of brain functioning.

Often, people treated quickly have the best chances of full recovery. Younger people and people whose swelling is controlled are more likely to see better results during recovery.

Outlook

Even after treatment, a subdural hematoma has the potential to lead to death or permanent brain damage. A quick medical response and care are essential to give a person the best chance of survival and full recovery.

It is essential for a person to follow all recommendations for post-surgery treatment to increase the chances of a favorable outcome.","lifethreatening

"Elaine K. Luo, MD","A look at dwarfism, a condition that causes a person to be very short. Included is detail on the diagnosis of dwarfism and management for the condition.",2017-12-09T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,"Dwarfism: Types, causes, and information",http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320286.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320286/320286_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Dwarfism occurs when a person is unusually short. Dwarfism itself is not a disease and, as a result, it has no single medical definition.

Different organizations define dwarfism according to various criteria. The advocacy group, Little People of America, define dwarfism as a condition that results in an adult height of less than 4 foot 10 inches.

Medically, a person is considered to have dwarfism when they have a condition that causes them to be very short. But society might consider a person to be a dwarf based on short stature alone.

Dwarfism has many different causes. Several of the causes of dwarfism can lead to other health problems, such as osteoarthritis.

Fast facts on dwarfism: Dwarfism causes a person to be very short in stature.

Dozens of medical conditions can cause dwarfism.

Diagnosis is frequently only made after the birth of a child.

Most people with dwarfism can do everything average height people can.

Types and causes



There are many different conditions that can cause dwarfism.

Image credit: Richard McCoy, 2014 There are many different conditions that can cause dwarfism.Image credit: Richard McCoy, 2014

Some conditions that cause dwarfism disrupt the hormones that enable the body to grow. Dwarfism can also be due to metabolic disorders or malnourishment.

A group of conditions called skeletal dysplasias is the most common cause of dwarfism.

Skeletal dysplasias cause the bones to grow abnormally, resulting in a small stature. This abnormal growth can also result in uneven growth that produces a body of unusual proportions.

Typically, skeletal dysplasias are genetic conditions. Most people with skeletal dysplasias have parents of normal stature.

The three most common types of skeletal dysplasias are achondroplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, and diastrophic dysplasia.

Achondroplasia

Early in childhood, much of the cartilage a person is born with transforms into harder bone. In achondroplasia, this process does not happen as effectively.

Achondroplasia primarily affects the bones of the arms and legs. Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder present at birth. Its symptoms include:

a normal-sized torso

very short arms and legs, which may be difficult to move

a large forehead

Some people with achondroplasia develop bone issues, such as scoliosis, have difficulty breathing, or suffer from a narrowing of the spine called spinal stenosis.

A rare form of achondroplasia occurs when people inherit two copies of a mutated gene that causes achondroplasia. This leads to very short bones and a poorly-developed rib cage. Most people with this disorder are stillborn or die in infancy because they cannot breathe.

Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita

Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDc) is a genetic mutation that causes a short torso, short arms, and short legs.

The spine, arms, and legs of people with this condition do not grow as expected. This makes them very short, but produces hands, feet, and a head of typical size.

In addition to a short stature, people with SEDc may experience a range of health problems, including:

spine and hip issues

foot deformities

cleft palate

joint diseases

SEDc may change the shape of the face, making the facial bones look flat.

Diastrophic dysplasia

Diastrophic dysplasia is the result of a gene mutation. It affects cartilage and bone development, causing very short arms and legs and a short stature.

People with this condition commonly have spine deformities and a condition called hitchhiker's thumb that changes the shape of the thumbs.

People with diastrophic dysplasia often develop joint pain and mobility issues in childhood. They may have scoliosis, clubfoot, or difficulty moving.

Diastrophic dysplasia can cause breathing problems, particularly in childhood. Some children with this condition die of respiratory problems.

Other types of dwarfism

Other causes of dwarfism may be due to:

organ failure that undermines the body's ability to produce hormones or metabolize nutrients

insufficient levels of certain hormones, particularly human growth hormone (HGH)

malnourishment or lack of sufficient food, resulting in growth problems

These are all secondary causes of dwarfism. This means they are not genetic, and may be reversible with early detection and prompt treatment.

How is dwarfism diagnosed?

The most common forms of dwarfism, which are caused by genetic abnormalities of the skeleton and cartilage, may be detected through genetic testing when a fetus is still developing.

Most doctors only perform these tests when there is a reason to believe a fetus is at risk when dwarfism runs in a family. Because most people with dwarfism have parents of normal height, the condition is not typically detected until after birth.

Skeletal dysplasias, the most common type of dwarfism, can usually be diagnosed shortly after birth. X-rays, genetic testing, and a physical exam are frequently enough to diagnose the condition.

Less common forms of dwarfism typically appear later in life. They may be more difficult to diagnose, particularly if a child has no other symptoms other than short stature.

Blood testing to measure HGH levels, testing to assess organ health, and a complete medical history typically reveals the cause.

Treatment and management



Surgery to correct spinal cord abnormalities may help with the management of symptoms. Surgery to correct spinal cord abnormalities may help with the management of symptoms.

Some metabolic and hormonal causes of dwarfism may be reversible. Injections with HGH, for example, can help people with a growth hormone deficiency grow to a normal height.

The most common causes of dwarfism, however, are not curable. Instead, treatments focus on managing the symptoms, including:

surgery to correct abnormalities in the bones and spinal cord

removing the tonsils or adenoids to make it easier to breathe

spinal decompression surgery

using a tube called a shunt to drain fluid from the brain

lifestyle changes, such as exercise and weight loss

People with many forms of dwarfism are vulnerable to obesity. Additional weight can increase their risk of heart problems.

Living with dwarfism

People with dwarfism may need help with related medical conditions, such as osteoarthritis. Nevertheless, very short people can and do lead normal lives.

Many people with dwarfism say that the most difficult part of their condition is the stigma it carries. This stigma may include bullying and employment discrimination, as well as the use of negative terms like ""midget.""

Because people with dwarfism have special medical needs, most need regular consultations with a team of doctors, including bone and cartilage specialists. However, with management of symptoms, it is possible for a person with dwarfism to live a long and healthy life.

Takeaway

Dwarfism does not have to be viewed as a disabling condition. The TLC show, Little People, Big World, shares the stories of people with dwarfism leading typical lives.

Treating dwarfism as a disability may make very short people feel stigmatized.","spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita sedc

Ana Sandoiu,New research uses facial recognition analysis to accurately predict health. The findings also show that the human brain has similar abilities.,2017-12-09T00:00:00Z,medical-news-today,Why facial recognition is the future of diagnostics,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320316.php,https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/hero/320/320316/320316_1100.jpg,health-and-medical,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"It's 2049 and you're feeling sick. Instead of going to the doctor — which has become an obsolete profession — you take out your phone and take a diagnosing ""selfie."" Fiction? More like soon to be a fact; scientists have designed a computer model that accurately predicts your health based on the shape of your face.



A facial recognition computer model can accurately predict your BMI, body fat, and blood pressure, new research shows. A facial recognition computer model can accurately predict your BMI, body fat, and blood pressure, new research shows.

Here's a futuristic little nugget that the latest Blade Runner appears to have missed: in the year 2049, replicants would have also come in a ""doctor model,"" because androids with superior diagnosing abilities are becoming easier and easier to fathom.

If that sounds too far-fetched, just consider this: a computer model has not only managed to accurately ""guess"" aspects of health just by looking at a face, but the human brain was also recently found to work in the exact same way.

Dr. Ian Stephen, of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and his colleagues used facial shape analysis to correctly detect markers of physiological health in more than 270 individuals of different ethnicities.

""We have developed a computer model,"" explains Dr. Stephen, ""that can determine information about a person's health simply by analyzing their face, supporting the idea that the face contains valid, perceptible cues to physiological health.""

The findings have now been published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, and they make the idea of a computer-enhanced super-doctor whose brain has been optimized for flawless diagnosing appear more scientific than fictional.

Or, in the meantime, maybe just a very cool app will do.

Model predicts body fat, BMI, blood pressure

Dr. Stephen explains how the study was carried out: ""First, we used photos of 272 Asian, African, and Caucasian faces to train the computer to recognize people's body fat, BMI, [...] and blood pressure from the shape of their faces.""

""We then asked the computer to predict these three health variables in other faces, and found that it could do so,"" says Dr. Stephen.

Next, the researchers wanted to see whether or not humans would detect health cues in the same way. So, Dr. Stephen and his colleagues designed an app that enabled human participants to change the appearance of the faces so that they would look as healthy as possible.

The parameters of the app could be changed according to the computer model.

""We found that the participants altered the faces to look lower in fat, have a lower BMI and, to a lesser extent, a lower blood pressure, in order to make them look healthier,"" says Dr. Stephen.

""This suggests that some of the features that determine how healthy a face looks to humans are the same features that the computer model was using to predict body fat, BMI, and blood pressure.""

In other words, our brains work in much the same way as the computer model, and they can predict health from a facial shape with surprising accuracy.

Dr. Stephen goes on to speculate about the evolutionary significance of the findings. He says, ""The results suggest that our brains have evolved mechanisms for extracting health information from people's faces, allowing us to identify healthy people to mate with or to form cooperative relationships with.""

""This fills an important missing link in current evolutionary theories of attractiveness,"" he adds.

""The findings,"" Dr. Stephen concludes, ""provide strong support for the hypothesis that the face contains valid, perceptible cues to physiological health, and while the models are at an early stage, we hope that they could be used to help diagnose health problems in the future.""

But will the future still have doctors in it? Or simply health-diagnosing apps? Or even super-capable healthcare replicants performing the jobs that humans no longer wish to do? It remains to be seen...","macquarie university in sydney australia

Bernie Sanders on Sunday warned against “jumping the gun” in pursuing impeachment charges against President Donald Trump and maintained that any potential proceedings should not be partisan.

“I think there is a process that has to be followed,” the Vermont independent said on NBC's “Meet the Press,” urging Democrats to wait for special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation on Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election to play out before starting any kind of formal impeachment process.

“I think Mr. Mueller is doing a very good job on his investigation,” Sanders said. “If Mueller brings forth the clear evidence that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, I think you have grounds for impeachment.”

California businessman Tom Steyer has launched a multimillion-dollar campaign of television ads calling for Trump to be impeached, drawing the ire of some top Democrats.

This week, more than four dozen Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to move ahead with a resolution brought by Democratic Congressman Al Green of Texas to impeach the president, but it was ultimately tabled by a vote of 364 to 58.

Last week, Sanders urged the president to “think about resigning” because he has “acknowledged on tape that he assaulted women,” a reference to the Access Hollywood video that was released in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.

Sanders reiterated that call on “Meet the Press,” but also acknowledged he doesn’t think the current timing for considering impeachment is appropriate.

We have a president who acknowledged on tape that he assaulted women. I would hope that he pays attention to what's going on and think about resigning. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 7, 2017

“I think jumping the gun does nobody any good,” he said. “You have to bring the American people onto this issue. You don’t want to make it into a partisan issue. If we’re going to go forward with impeachment, I want the American people clearly to understand why that is the case, why it makes sense, why it’s the right thing to do.

Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the committee, said Sunday.

Donald Trump Jr. voluntarily spent Wednesday in a closed-door meeting with lawmakers on the panel, but Himes noted that the committee has used a rule of not forcing testimony from those who speak with them on a voluntary basis.

“We may need to sort of subpoena him or get him back under a compulsory process” Himes said on “Meet The Press.”

After the questioning wrapped, multiple members of the committee reported that Trump Jr. tried to use the defense of “attorney-client privilege” to avoid having to describe conversations with his father about his meeting last year with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Neither President Trump nor his son are attorneys.

Himes said Trump Jr. was largely ""forthcoming"" in his interview, but ""because of the sort of novel claim of privilege, we don’t know what happened in that conversation.""

He added that a focus of the committee’s investigation has turned to what happened after that Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 and whether communication between Russians and the Trump campaign progressed, but he was careful to say that it's still a question whether there was any ""collusion"" between the Trump campaign and Russia to try and influence the election.

“The question before us now is what happened afterwards,” Himes said. “Was there follow-up? Was dirt conveyed in any way, shape, or form and was it used? Because of course, we’ve seen a lot of contact, we’ve seen desire to get dirt, desire to work with Russians, desire to contact the Russians. The question is, was there some form – and it is a question, I don’t want to prejudice the outcome – was there cooperation?”

Himes on Sunday also praised the work of the investigation’s chairman, Republican Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, who took over leading the House investigation after Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes stepped aside earlier this year.

Nunes this week was cleared of any wrongdoing in a House Ethics Committee probe looking into whether he disclosed any classified information.

Himes said he would only like to welcome Nunes back as the investigation’s chair if Nunes was willing to “drop the role that he has played” on investigating improper unmasking, a pursuit Himes called “nakedly political.”

“I like and respect Devin but sadly he has devoted himself in the last couple months to these things that I regard as distractions: wiretapping of Trump Tower, 'is the FBI being forthcoming about the Steele dossier.' I think he would need to drop all of those distractions and come back in an impartial way, the way Mike Conaway has steered this investigation.”","house intelligence committee

Stephen Leahy,A new study renews fears that oil palm plantations could drive the legendary cats extinct.,2017-12-10T05:00:00Z,national-geographic,Extremely Endangered Tiger Losing Habitat—and Fast,https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/palm-oil-sumatran-tigers-extinction-big-cats-animals.html,https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/188/342/smpost_1512767089811.jpg,science-and-nature,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Watch: Extremely Endangered Tiger Losing Habitat—and Fast

As Sumatran rain forests fall to palm oil plantations, their critically endangered tiger may soon vanish from the planet.

There are now only two regions on the Indonesian island with enough breeding females to sustain the species, according to a new study.

Watch Big Cat Week on NatGeo WILD all week, starting Sunday, December 10 at 9/8c.

“The erosion of large wilderness areas pushes Sumatran tigers one step closer to extinction,” says study leader Matthew Luskin, research fellow with the Smithsonian Institution who's based at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

The Sumatran is the smallest of the nine original subspecies—males rarely grow to eight feet long.

Despite successful anti-poaching efforts, the Sumatran tiger population has declined about 17 percent since 2000, to just 600 animals left in the wild. Tigers on the neighboring islands of Java, Bali, and Singapore went extinct in the 20th century. (Read how some tiger populations are rising.)

That's largely because, between 2000 and 2012, some 17 percent of prime tiger habitat was torn down, mainly for oil palm plantations, which covers nearly 30 million acres of the country.

“Sumatra has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world,” adds Luskin, who received funding for his research from the National Geographic Society.

Disappearing Forests

Using images and videos from hundreds of infrared camera traps set up in two national parks, Luskin and his team identified individual tigers by their unique stripe patterns. This provided an estimate of how many tigers live in a given area. (Read: ""How Many Tigers Are There Really? A Conservation Mystery."")

This new information was combined with data from 17 previous estimates of tiger population density.

Tracking Tigers Is Just As Dangerous As It Sounds The remaining habitat of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger is being rapidly deforested. Wildlife ecologist Matthew Luskin studies tigers with remotely triggered camera traps to understand where they are in order to help conserve them.

The results revealed that tiger numbers are twice as high in primary versus degraded, or logged, forests—highlighting the extreme importance of primary forest to the survival of the species.

Luskin and colleagues' global conservation strategy for tigers depends on maintaining a network of “secure source populations” with at least 25 breeding females in suitable habitat large enough to have more than 50 breeding females.

Sixty years ago Sumatra likely had a dozen of these secure source populations across the island. Today there are just two: Sumatra’s Kerinci Seblat National Park and Gunung Leuser National Park, in the northern part of the island.

“We set up a bunch of cameras inside Kerinci Seblat National Park, but when we returned to retrieve them 10 weeks later, I was shocked to see about 50 hectares of the forest had been clearcut,” says Luskin, whose study was published December 5 in the journal Nature Communications.

An Ocean of Palm Oil

Illegal logging in Kerinci Seblat is a major threat to other species, as well. “It’s an incredibly beautiful jungle with endangered Sumatran elephants, clouded leopards, and many others species. It should be a conservation priority."" (Learn about the National Geographic Society's Big Cats Initiative.)

Many local and international groups are working to preserve the forests; the Indonesian government is also on board, but needs do a lot more, he adds. In 2014, under pressure from conservation groups, the big oil palm companies adopted a no-deforestation policy.

Found in a huge array of products, from shampoo to cosmetics to chocolate bars, palm oil is one of the world's most commonly used vegetable oils. (Read about the human cost of Indonesia's palm oil plantations.)

“Flying over Sumatra is like flying over an ocean of oil palm plantations,” adds co-author Mathias Tobler, a scientist with San Diego Zoo Global. “There’s no question that it’s the main driver of deforestation.""

“Safeguarding the remaining expanses of primary forests is now absolutely critical to ensuring tigers can persist indefinitely on Sumatra,"" Tobler says.

At the end of the day, Luskin says he’s optimistic about the future of the Sumatran tiger.","kerinci seblat national park and gunung leuser national park

Egyptian officials today announced the discovery and excavation of two tombs found in the necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga in Luxor. The tombs, dated to the 18th Dynasty (1550-1292 B.C.) belonged to officials who likely served here at the ancient capital of Thebes, now a UNESCO world heritage site.

The tombs were surveyed and numbered by German Egyptologist Friederike Kampp-Seyfried in the 1990s. At the time, the tomb known as Kampp 161 was never opened, while the tomb identified as Kampp 150 was only excavated to its entrance. The tombs were recently re-discovered and excavated by Egyptian archaeologists.

The names of the officials buried in the tombs remains unknown, as no inscriptions bearing the names of the tombs' occupants have yet been found. In April, the tomb of an 18th Dynasty magistrate named Userhat was discovered in the same necropolis.

Kampp 161 likely dates to the reigns of Amenhotep II or Thutmose IV, based on stylistic and architectural comparisons with other tombs in the area, making it around 3,400 years old. The western wall of the tomb features an elaborate depiction of a social event, possibly a banquet, with a figure presenting offerings to the tomb's occupant and his wife. Wooden funerary masks, the remains of furniture, and a decorated coffin were discovered in the tomb.

Ancient Egypt 101 Ancient Egyptian civilization, famous for its pyramids, pharaohs, mummies, and tombs, flourished for thousands of years. But what was its lasting impact?

Kampp 150 most likely dates to the reign of Thutmose I—roughly a century earlier than Kampp 161—based on a cartouche found in the tomb. While no name-bearing inscription was found, many funerary seals bearing the names of a writer named Maati and his wife Mohi, found in the tomb's courtyard, may hint at the identification of the tomb's occupant. Archaeologists found colorful wooden statues, funerary masks and a linen-wrapped mummy in the tomb.

In the age of GPS and Google Maps, it is hard to believe that maps can include places that don’t exist. But author Malachy Tallack argues that maps are as much “a cartography of the mind” as they are a way to figure out where we are. In his new book, The Un-Discovered Islands, Tallack takes readers on a journey to imaginary places—mythic islands, mapmakers’ mistakes, mirages, and outright hoaxes. [Find out how explorer Robert Peary discovered a continent that wasn’t there.]

When National Geographic caught up with Tallack on a Greek island (a real one), he explained why some islands blur the line between life and death; how others have moved about on the maps; and why we’re living in an era of un-discovery. [Discover why ancient mapmakers were afraid of blank spaces.]

You write, “For as long as people have been making stories, they have been inventing islands.” Explain why that is—with some examples.

It is natural for us, standing on the shore looking out to the horizon, to imagine there are places out there we cannot see. Many cultures have such places that are important parts of their cultural traditions. One of the best known is Hawaiki, which the Maori people believe to be not just their geographical origin, but also their spiritual origin—the place they were born from and would die into.

These islands that blur the boundaries between life and death seem to have existed in all cultures. The ancient Greeks imagined a place called the Islands of the Blessed, which in some ways resembled the idea of the Christian heaven, except that this was paradise on Earth where the chosen few would go to when it came time to die. That idea then migrated into Celtic mythology. The most famous example is Avalon, where King Arthur supposedly went at the end of his life.

Another category you write about is what you call “ex-isles.” What makes an island disappear?

All of the islands in this book are, I suppose, ex-isles, in that they were places that were believed in at one point, but which are no longer found on the map. The most common reason was that sailors would make errors. They would think they were seeing an island whereas, in fact, it was a mirage, they were in the wrong place, or the conditions were so terrible that it wasn’t what they thought it was. The oceans became populated by islands that, in fact, turned out not to exist.

It’s much easier to discover an island than it is to un-discover one because you have to go back and check it is not actually there. During the Age of Discovery, explorers were also tempted to invent islands, which they would often name after rich patrons, in the hope of squeezing a bit of extra money for further exploration.

Take the island of Thule. It was supposedly discovered by Greek explorer Pytheas, and became part of the Greek idea of what lay in the north. Later, it became absorbed by the Romans, who believed that the Shetland Islands were Thule. Later on, people believed that Iceland or Norway was Thule. Eventually, the word became not a place but an idea of northern-ness; somewhere that was extreme and far away. It became part of the cartography of the mind more than the cartography of the map.

Mapping the Mysterious Islands Near San Francisco Cartographers Marty Schnure and Ross Donihue traveled to the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge near San Francisco to document the scientists who live there and to create an interactive digital map to allow the public to explore the islands from afar.

Some people argue that it was the Irish, not the Norse, who first set foot in North America. Is there any truth to that?

In theory, it is possible. St. Brendan is the person sometimes credited with having done that, though the stories about him vary somewhat in the telling. The idea is that he set out to sea from Ireland and travelled to numerous places around the north Atlantic. Some of the stories are obviously fantastical, with demons, dragons, and sea serpents. But there are other parts that seem realistic. They talk about islands of smoke and fire, which could be volcanoes. Other parts seem to refer to icebergs. But the notion that a monk made it all the way to North America and back seems, to me, extraordinarily unlikely.

You say that the island of Hy-Brasil “begins with cartography and then moves backward into folklore.” Unpack that idea for us.

Hy-Brasil is one of the most famous and, in some ways, complicated of undiscovered islands. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the country Brazil. It’s long been thought that this island was part of Irish mythological tradition. Certainly, there are numerous islands within Celtic and Irish tradition that can sometimes be seen, and sometimes disappear. Hy-Brasil was thought of be one of those.

More recent studies have shown that Hy-Brasil didn’t appear in Irish mythology until the 19th century, hundreds of years after it was first located on a map. At that time, there were numerous other places called Brasil. The name referred to a kind of red dye, which was very valuable and one of the things explorers were looking for.

Hy-Brasil, which appeared on maps off the southwest coast of Ireland, may actually have come from rumors of the North American continent spread amongst European sailors. It was then later absorbed into the Irish mythological tradition, which is the opposite direction from what you would expect.

My favorite story in the book is of Princess Caraboo and the island of Javasu. Give us a synopsis.

That is also my favorite. [Laughs] It is an odd story and a strange island because, unlike most of these places, it never appeared on a map. The story begins in the south of England, in the early 19th century, when a woman appeared on a doorstep, dressed and behaving slightly oddly.

Nobody knew who she was. She didn’t speak English and nobody could understand what she said. She was taken in by the family of the local magistrate, Samuel Worrall, who looked after her and tried to find out who she was. Eventually, they located a man who said he could understand what she was saying. He said that the woman, who called herself Caraboo, had come from the island of Javasu, in the Far East, and was a princess.

But it turned out this was not the case. She was actually a woman called Mary Wilcox, from Devon, who had had a difficult life. She probably had mental health problems and had essentially retreated from the world.

But she attracted wealthy people from all over England because, at that time, the British were obsessed with the glamour of the Orient. There were newspaper stories; her portrait was painted. And that turned out to be her downfall because somebody recognized her in the newspaper and realized she was not who she was thought to be.

She is generally portrayed as a hoaxer. But the real hoaxer was the man who pretended to understand what she was saying and invented all of these details about Javasu and the life of this supposed princess, Caraboo.

In the end, she was deported to the U.S. For a time, she managed to make a living off her fame, but eventually she returned to England and lived in poverty. She is buried in Bristol in an unmarked grave. But some years ago, they made a movie about her.

In his only novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, Edgar Allan Poe incorporates one of the best-known stories of fictional isles, the Auroras, which you call “among the most inexplicable of phantom islands.” Why?

Most phantom islands were seen once and never seen again. A sailor thought he saw an island and later was found to be wrong. The Auroras break that mold because they were seen not just once, but seven or eight times, between the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. One of the ships that saw the Auroras was a Spanish research vessel, which went there specifically to find and survey the islands. So it was very strange that, after that time, nobody else could find them. They seem to have completely disappeared.

The best explanation for it is that all these sailors and ships, including the highly skilled Spanish surveyors, were somehow mistaken by conditions, potentially by icebergs, in that region. It’s one of several places where none of the explanations seem quite good enough. Nobody knows exactly what happened to the Auroras.

Some islands are the result not of cartographic error but downright fraud. Tell us how one phantom island played havoc with the peace treaty between the United States and Britain.

When the Treaty of Paris was drawn up in 1783, a big part of it was finalizing the borders between the new country, the U.S., and its neighbors. Most of those borders were fairly simple. But in the north, around the Great Lakes, it was more complicated geographically and politically. The treaty locates the border as running through Lake Superior, where it goes north of the isles Royale and Philippeaux.

Unfortunately, it was found several decades later that Isle Philippeaux did not exist. So, in the original treaty that created the U.S. as a country, there was a place that did not exist. Isle Philippeaux, along with several other islands within Lake Superior, was invented by a priest, who named them after a rich French politician, with the intention of getting more money.

The islands known as Los Jardines stubbornly remained on maps for 400 years, even though they never existed. In that time, they even moved about, didn’t they?

Like the Auroras, it’s hard to explain how Los Jardines, or Los Buenos Jardines, came to exist for such a long time. They were first reported in 1529 by Alvaro de Saavedra Ceron, in the Western Pacific, not far from New Guinea. He described 10 low-lying islands or atolls, which he named Los Buenos Jardines, and these islands remained on the map for a long time.

Two hundred or so years later, they moved northwards but there is no good explanation for why that happened. Perhaps a cartographer made an error or a sailor decided he had seen them elsewhere. It was not until 1973 that the International Hydrographic Organization finally removed them from the charts.

Today, it’s very difficult for us to imagine the lack of knowledge that many explorers had. They had no accurate way of measuring longitude until the mid-18th century, so they weren’t always sure where they were. In the Pacific Ocean, particularly, many islands appeared on maps but later had to be removed.

You call the 20th century “a time of un-discovery.” Tell us the story of Sandy Island and why you believe it is important that some places remain mysteries.

Sandy Island is the most recent island to be un-discovered, in late 2012. An Australian research vessel noticed discrepancies between the navigational chart and the systems they had on board, some of which showed Sandy Island in the region between Australia and New Caledonia, and some of which did not. They decided to have a look for themselves but found there was no such island, neither above nor beneath the surface. But Sandy Island still appeared on all kinds of charts and even Google Maps and Google Earth.

We assume digital navigation is perfect, that there are no mistakes, but there can be and this is the most famous example. It was widely reported around the world and people became quite excited about the idea of an island that both did and did not exist.

The reason, I think, is that, as the Age of Discovery came to a close, we lost some of the sense of mystery about the world that we had always had. To find a place that broke all the rules, which appeared on a map, yet wasn’t actually there, was an exciting idea. Sandy Island seems to speak to our deep desire for there to still be mysterious places out there. What I’ve tried to do is recreate that sense of the mystery of geography.

When Calgary food writer Julie van Rosendaal was asked to change the trademarked name Beavertails for her version of that Canadian pastry, she called them “Canadian semiaquatic rodent posterior doughnuts.”

Dam, girl!

The story made us curious about beavers, so hunker down in your lodge and enjoy some facts about these emblematic animals.

Adaptable Engineers

The North American beaver lives throughout most of Canada and the U.S., as well as parts of Mexico. The only other species, the Eurasian beaver, is native to nine countries, from France to China.

“Beavers can change the landscape like almost no species other than humans,” says Glynnis Hood, wildlife ecologist at the University of Alberta’s Augustana Campus and author of The Beaver Manifesto.

The famously busy mammals build elaborate homes, which are called lodges when they are in open water and very visible, says Jimmy Taylor, research wildlife biologist with USDA's National Wildlife Research Center and Oregon State University.

Beaver activity can be good for the environment—increasing open water can lessen drought and also widen wetlands—in some cases by nearly 600 percent.

Human Conflict

Beavers Are Geniuses In the Rocky Mountains, beavers build ponds, passageways, and warm winter homes.





Such industry also means beavers too often butt heads with humans. For example, their tendency to plug up human-made culverts can create flooding and other problems in some communities.

The beavers think, “humans are just dumb and they forgot to finish their dam,” Hood says.

Beaver Myth Busted

It may be surprising to some, but “not all beavers build dams,” says Taylor.

Beavers can live wherever there is persistent water, but sometimes their native river is too big to dam.

But they're fine as long as they have an area to build their lodge, like a riverbank, food, access to mates, and water that allows them to escape from predators—the reason they build dams in the first place.

Getting Busy

These family-loving animals were thought to be monogamous, but a 2009 genetic study of two populations in Illinois suggests the species “may be opportunistically promiscuous.”

“The pair bond is still there, but that male is sharing his genes with other females as well,” Taylor says, so they’re “socially monogamous but sexually polygamous.”

Sounds like something you’d hear in “divorce court,” he quips.

Family bonds are strong, though, and male and female beavers will fight unrelated beavers to the death over territory.

Tough Teeth

From tooth to tail, beaver anatomy is specialized for their lifestyle.

For instance, their tree-razing teeth have a slight backward curvature that makes their work easier. Not only that, their chompers never stop growing.

If they weren’t continually wearing their teeth down, the constant growth would prevent them from feeding, “and could eventually kill them,” Taylor says.

A recent study showed that trace minerals give beaver teeth their strength, and iron provides that rusty color.

Multi-tasking Tails

Beavers’ leathery tails have many functions: A brace as they’re sawing down trees; communication tools to ward off predators; and as energy storage units, increasing their fat supply up to 60 percent in cold weather, Hood says.

Their tails don’t need maintenance, but their fur is another story.

In doing so, the mammals keep air spaces in their warm undercoat and distribute their outer fur with castoreum oil, which they produce to scent mark and waterproof themselves.

“They have a special grooming paw on their hind foot, like a little split toenail,” Hood says, and they “spend almost 20 percent of their time grooming"" themselves and each other.

This behavior helps keep air spaces in their warm undercoat and works in oil from their anal glands to waterproof their outer fur.

The mammals also produce an oil called castoreum, which they mix with urine to use as a scent marker, Taylor says.

So maybe those tails really are a bit like donuts. Bon appetit!","minden pictures national geographic creative beavers

The death of a bald eagle—a national symbol—in the U.S. capital has stirred a wider debate about potential impacts of lead bullets and other sources of harmful metals in the environment, especially given a recent ruling by the federal government.

When veterinarians in Washington, D.C., took in a bald eagle on Tuesday, it was already in the advanced stages of lead poisoning. The animal had been reportedly picked up in Nanjemoy, Maryland, by an area police officer, who told the Washington Post the bird was sitting only 100 feet from a rural road.

Once at City Wildlife, an animal treatment center, tests revealed high levels of lead in the bird's system. Despite efforts to expel the toxic substance, the bird died late Wednesday night. The bird had shown no physical indications of lead poisoning aside from unusual behavior.

According to Kristy Jacobus, one of the women who treated the bird, it's the third eagle the center has seen this year but the only one treated for lead.

""It's not uncommon,"" she said for the center to treat lead-poisoned birds. But more often, they deal with pigeons that ingest lead at construction sites. Eagles, however, tend to ingest lead when they consume animals that have been shot with lead bullets.

Without more situational evidence, it's nearly impossible to say exactly where the eagle came into contact with lead. But most often, they encounter the toxic element when they scavenge for food. After hunters shoot an animal, they tend to gut it, leaving the innards out in the open. These ""gut piles,"" as they're referred to, then attract scavenging eagles.

Lead poisoning tends to take several days or weeks. Some eagles ingest the lead-filled remains of several animals before succumbing.

How Populations Are Impacted Today

So, is this eagle a canary in a coal mine?

Exactly how many eagles or other raptors succumb to lead poisoning and where they're being poisoned is unclear. For every bird of prey that's brought into a treatment center, more die unnoticed in the wild. As bald eagle populations rebound from historic lows, the sheer number of eagles people come into contact with is also rising. Just this week, populations in Wisconsin reached record highs.

""We don't have a good idea about the magnitude of the problem,"" said EJ Williams from the American Bird Conservancy. ""It's a real case-by-case basis.""

In California, for example, condors were severely impacted by the use of lead ammunition. The birds were regularly consuming lead-contaminated remains of hunted animals, and their population struggled to grow.

To combat this, the state outlawed lead ammunition in hunting in 2013, in a requirement that will phase in gradually until 2019.

How Populations Could be Impacted in the Future

Earlier this year, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reversed an Obama-era rule banning lead ammunition on wildlife refuges.

Lead-free bullets are typically more expensive, and those opposing the bill argued that hunting would become less accessible for lower income hunters. Banning lead bullets also touched a cultural nerve among pro-gun groups that oppose any roadblocks to using firearms.

Scientist and wildlife conservationists, however, have long been calling for a lead bullet ban. In 2013, a group of scientists collectively released a statement warning that lead bullets could have yet-to-be-seen and unknown consequences in the future. Lead ammunition currently amounts to the second most used source of lead in the U.S. and frequently discharges the toxic substance into the environment.

In their statement, the scientists noted that lead bullet fragments can poison birds and people that eat contaminated meat.

Today, there's not enough evidence to prove how and to what extent using lead ammunition on wild lands will impact wildlife in the future.","construction sites eagles

Our blue planet spins suspended in outer space—and it hums, too.

European researchers say the Earth's incessant hum originates from the bottom of the ocean. This study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in November, gleans material from ocean-bottom seismometer stations, contrasting with previous data from vibration tools based on land.

""It's like taking a piano and slamming all the keys at the same time,"" says Spahr Webb of Columbia University's Earth Institute, who was not associated with the study. ""Except they're not nice harmonics. They're oddball frequencies.""

Humming by the Numbers

The planet's hum has tickled scientists' minds since 1959, but definitive research was not completed on the topic until 1998. This current paper is the first to document the rumble from the bottom of the ocean.

The researchers, spread out across earth science institutes in Paris, Stuttgart, and Oxford, U.K., combed through 11-months' worth of seismometer records covering a patch of more than 1,200 square miles on the Indian Ocean floor east of Madagascar. From that data, gathered from 2012 and 2013, they homed in on two stations with high quality data and sliced out any interfering sounds from loud waves and electronic glitches. Behold: the native sound of the Earth.

But the terrestrial hum is virtually silent.

The planet's vibration, or record of ""free oscillations,"" hovers between 2.9 and 4.5 millihertz. That's a frequency 10,000 times lower than what humans can pick up; our hearing threshold starts around 20 hertz.

The researchers also found that the hum's amplitude, or loudness, varied over time. However, the sound change didn't depend on the seasons, which goes against other studies surveying a wider band of frequency, or pitch, than the one looked at in this study.

Related: Here's What Earthquakes Look Like From Inside The Earth

Looking Forward

The Earth's hum is nothing new, Webb says. When looking at early seismometers, scientists saw the instrument's needles swing back and forth for a few seconds at a time, which they attributed to regular rumbles. They looked at ocean waves that produced pulses of pressure when traveling in opposite directions, and deduced that longer waves interacting with the bottom of the ocean are probably what's driving the Earth's hum.

""Fairly early on, people realized this was caused by ocean waves,"" Webb says. ""As instruments have gotten better, we've realized the hum's going on all the time.""

Since early observations, a number of studies have hypothesized that the Earth's free oscillations are a side-effect of the pounding of ocean waves. Other research suggests the hum could originate from atmospheric turbulence, or the wind motions around the globe, cued by storms. The current study says turbulence could account for part of the vibration, leading the rest to be fueled by ocean waves.

But not everyone agrees. ""Turbulence in the atmosphere is moving very, very slowly. It's not energetic enough,"" says Webb of Columbia. ""The hum is solely associated with ocean waves.""

By studying the Earth's hum signal from ocean-bottom stations, scientists can map out a detailed landscape of the Earth's interior. Currently, they can only look at the inside of the planet during earthquakes, which limits studies to certain times and areas. And when looking at seismic activity from land monitors, researchers can't chart places far removed from islands and land masses. But the hum signal, droning and constant, can be detected across the world.","columbia universitys earth institute

Cities are working to reintroduce nature into the urban environment, sometimes in unexpected ways.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed its climate change hub from public view earlier this year, 17 cities had a response: Each posted the information on city government sites.

The move was symbolic of a quiet revolution: Environmental, social, and economic change is increasingly centered at the city level.

Innovation in cities was on display at a recent Greenbuild, an event devoted to green building and sustainable development that draws a diverse roster of attendees.

Some solutions were novel: A unit in the Boston mayor’s office called New Urban Mechanics that specializes in using low-cost hacks and technology to improve urban living highlighted the Stairs of Fabulousness at city hall. Created with simple rainbow-hued tape, the design—purported by its author to make the Brutalist building 400 percent more fabulous—was the result of a public space invitational to temporarily transform spots around the city. Other projects go deeper, but the stairs exemplify the group’s mission to delight and engage citizens—and a larger effort to refocus urban design around people. Here's how that trend and four others are defining the cities of the future.

Building for People

Cars no longer drive urban planning—today it’s “people-oriented design,” says Neil Angus, a Boston environmental planner who specializes in implementing the LEED neighborhood-focused sustainability standard. “That still accommodates cars, but people come first.”

“It’s design on a pedestrian scale, with narrower streets, and pushing buildings closer to the street and to each other,” says Angus. “That in turn brings people closer together—the front porch concept.” Other aspects include a grocery store within walking distance, proximity to transit, high-performing green buildings, green space and trees along streets, and space for cyclists.

In Boston’s diverse Dorchester neighborhood, the 13-block Talbot-Norfolk Triangle (TNT) is piloting that model of transformation in a historically underserved area. “We flipped the script,” says David Queeley, of the area’s redevelopment corporation. “Why can’t this happen in low-income neighborhoods?”

Spurred in part by the arrival of a commuter rail line along one of its borders, the community is converting vacant buildings and aging housing while building on economic opportunities that transit connectivity and revitalization bring—without displacing longtime residents. At least 100 affordable housing units have been built.

“Boston has the largest income disparity of any city and it’s the fastest gentrifying,” says Queeley. “If we don’t do something differently, it’s going to look homogenous.”

Inclusivity and innovation define renewal efforts. “We layer different sustainability strategies,” says Queeley. The Men of Color Initiative tackles TNT’s unemployment rate for men, which approaches 50 percent. Energy efficiency was improved by retrofitting more than 500 homes. For a safer pedestrian zone, TNT is part of Boston’s Slow Streets initiative, which enforces a neighborhood speed limit of 20 miles per hour. Residents and activists have helped create a sense of place with a park that’s become a hub for activity, mural projects, and an urban agriculture site. Bus shelters were outfitted with green roofs, a greenway trail system is under way, and a tree-planting program has also led to jobs through horticulture training.

Health and Wellness

With 90 percent of our time spent indoors, building design and its impact in the workplace, schools, and even hospital settings has been an emerging area of research.

Studies conducted by Harvard’s Healthy Buildings center found that in green buildings with enhanced ventilation and optimal thermal conditions, participants scored 26 percent higher on cognitive function tests and had fewer symptoms of sick building syndrome. Exposure to daylight and brighter, blue-enriched lighting, which best mimics natural light, was also associated with better sleep quality.

Chemical substances used in building materials and furnishing that are known to accumulate in both humans and the environment are coming under closer scrutiny, and Harvard is practicing what it teaches: The university’s purchasing community is working to reduce “chemicals of concern” throughout the campus, starting with buying furniture that’s free of flame retardants. Facebook and Kaiser Permanente have made similar pledges.

At Google—where cofounder Larry Page has been known to carry a particulate counter to monitor pollutants—a team is steering its global offices and vendors toward safer options, potentially extending the company’s influence with its Portico database that scores products for health impacts and transparency. In connection with its materials research lab, Perkins+Will architects publish a precautionary list, such as antimicrobial agents, for designers and home owners.

Test your knowledge of how buildings impact health.

Going Green

Urban planners continually find more creative ways to weave nature into the city, particularly with space at a premium. It doesn’t necessarily have to take the form of sprawling parks. Jonce Walker, who works in sustainable design in New York City, sees pockets of nature functioning like “acupuncture” for residents. “Small, strategic interventions offer relief to people who live in cities,” says Walker. “We must be careful not to erase nature out of cities, and work on putting nature back in.”

The best of these spots, he says, have the element of surprise—encountering nature where one might least expect it—and offer “dwell time,” a way to linger and admire it.

Walker points to projects such as Paley Park and PARK(ing) Day, a movement to convert metered parking spots into temporary public spaces that began in San Francisco and spread to other cities. In New York, it’s similarly represented by Street Seats, a seasonal program allowing benches and chairs, surrounded by landscaping, to be installed on streets. “It’s taking back part of the street for cars and giving it to people,” says Walker. In Brooklyn, the 2,000 Gallon Project uses dumpsters planted with trees and vegetation to divert stormwater that might ordinarily overflow with sewage into Gowanus Canal. The display “integrates nature into a very industrial place—and it’s moveable,” he says.

Planting trees is a more permanent solution. Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities have committed to a 40 percent canopy cover goal. D.C. is already close—about 38.7 percent—and it’s moved to protect “heritage trees” whose trunks are 100 inches or more in circumference, says Luke Cole of the city’s environment and energy department. About 12,000 trees were planted over the last year as part of the effort. Citizens are in on it too: A program offers a consult for residential property owners and subsidies for incorporating shade trees, rain gardens, and native plants, which help reduce storm runoff. The program contributes up to 8 percent of the city’s new trees.

(See innovative green space in Singapore, the leading biophilic city.)

Planning for Climate Change

Superstorm Sandy’s crippling effect on Manhattan in 2012 spurred cities to launch resilience plans that anticipate rising seas, more frequent storms, and flooding. In 2014 San Francisco became the first to designate a climate resilience officer, and at least 84 other global cities have followed. In the wake of recent hurricanes impacting Houston, Miami, and Puerto Rico—the most expensive hurricane season in U.S. history—efforts have accelerated.

At the confluence of two rivers, Washington, D.C., is battling both sinking and sea-level rise—levels have risen 11 inches over the past century, with 40 inches projected by 2080.

Climate Ready DC outlines measures for coping with those, along with more intense rainfall and storm surge, and highlights neighborhoods at risk. The plan’s 77 actions range from increasing the number of green roofs (already incentivized), collecting stormwater, creating micro-grids for energy and water, incorporating resilience in building and zoning codes, and identifying “cooling centers” where those who may not have access to air conditioning could retreat during scorching summer heat—the city projects two to three times as many dangerously hot days.

The plan also calls for “a communications exercise,” a strategy for reaching different segments of the city, says Perkins+Will architect Jon Penndorf, who was part of a team that developed the plan. That includes outreach to lower income and less mobile populations, who are often in the most vulnerable parts of the city, by enlisting existing channels, such as churches and other community groups, and messaging for tourists too, he says.

The Net-Zero Standard

Net-zero waste, water, and energy have been called the sustainable trifecta, creating “living buildings.” Seattle’s Bullitt Center, for example, has a rooftop rainwater harvesting system and composting toilets and taps solar energy for its needs.

A net-zero energy building generates all its own power through on-site renewable sources. As of 2016, about 200 commercial buildings in the U.S. claimed the standard. Schools and campuses are increasingly incorporating net-zero energy systems—and using them as a teaching tool. (See a gallery of innovative educational facilities.)

In Oregon, where buildings consume 30 percent of the state’s energy use, it may soon be the norm. By October 2023, all new homes must be “zero-energy ready”—equipped for solar panel installation. Google’s Project Sunroof displays the solar potential of homes by street address.

Zero waste is somewhat of a misnomer: It means that 90 percent has been diverted from landfills, by prevention, reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting. Facilities, universities, and dozens of cities are getting in on the effort too, committing to reaching zero waste within the next two decades. Ljubljana, Slovenia, is leading the way in Europe while in the U.S. San Francisco may be the first to reach the target, aiming for 2020, through its “fantastic three”—separate composting, recycling, and trash bins for residents.

Embed Data: Republican Party ID drops after Trump election 1:56 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

Donald Trump’s presidential win was a boon for the Republican Party in Washington, consolidating the GOP’s control of the Oval Office, Senate and House of Representatives. But beyond the Beltway, poll data suggests the election has had the opposite effect on the party, pushing voters away.

From November 2016 to November 2017 there was a 5-point drop in the number of people who call themselves Republicans, from 42 percent to 37 percent, according to Gallup. In that same time, the number of people identifying as Democrats stayed flat at 44 percent.

Do the math and a 2-point edge for the Democrats in party identification, 44 percent to 42 percent, has been pushed to 7 points, 44 percent to 37 percent, in just one year. That’s getting up into the area that may be a concern for Republicans in the 2018 midterms, where a big swing in party allegiance could lead to a swing in House and Senate seats.

You can see the potential impact of party-switching numbers like those in this year’s Virginia governor’s race. The exit polls from that race compared to the 2013 election showed Republican affiliation was down 2 points, while Democratic affiliation was up 4 points.

The result? Democrat Ralph Northam won what many thought would be a close race by nine points and Republicans lost 15 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates.

But perhaps just as concerning for the GOP may be how widespread the party defections have been. The numbers have dropped across a wide range of demographic groups — all age groups, different education levels and most racial and ethnic groups.

Among 18- to 34-year-olds, there was a 4-point drop in people identifying as Republicans. With 35- to 55-year-olds the drop was 4 points. And among those older than 55, the drop was 5 points.

College graduates saw a 4-point decline in Republican ID and those without a bachelor’s degree saw a 5-point dip.

White, non-Hispanic respondents saw their GOP share drop 5 points. Hispanics saw a 3-point decline. African-Americans actually saw a 1-point increase in their self-identifying Republican population, but the number, 10 percent, is still remarkably low.

To be clear, these drops aren’t just due to selecting two points in time; the Gallup data show that since November 2016, there’s been a fairly consistent drop in the number of people who identify as Republican or “lean Republican.” And these are important numbers to keep in mind when you see reports about how high Trump’s job approval is among Republicans.

Currently, Trump’s support among Republicans, 78 percent approval, is in line with normal figures for a first-term president. Barack Obama was at 82 percent approval among Democrats at roughly the same point of his presidency. Bill Clinton was at 76 percent with Democrats at roughly this point.

But as these numbers indicate, that 78 percent approval comes from a smaller group of people. So among people who were “Republicans” when Trump was elected, the approval number is likely lower.

The data also suggest there is one group, in particular, that is a problem for GOP in the Trump era: women, especially white women.

Among women overall, the number identifying as Republican has declined 5 points, to 32 percent from 37 percent, but among white, non-Hispanic women, the drop has been an especially precipitous 7 points, to 41 percent this November from 48 percent in November 2016.

That drop among white, non-Hispanic women coincided with an increase in the same group who now identify as Democrats, and when you put those numbers together you see a flip in the partisan lean of that group.

In November 2016, white women were more likely to identify as Republican than Democrat by 5 points, 48 percent to 43 percent. By November of this year they were more like to say they were Democrats by 5 points, 46 percent to 41 percent.

As 2018 nears and the midterm elections come into focus that could be a real challenge for Republicans. Women traditionally make up a larger part of the electorate than men. And white women could be a crucial factor in the vote in suburban and exurban House districts held by Republicans.

That raises some serious questions for the Republican Party. How will the GOP’s congressional leadership handle its members who have been accused of inappropriate behavior toward women? And what happens if Alabama elects accused teen-girl molester Roy Moore to serve as a Republican senator on Tuesday?

The Republican-Democrat gender gap is nothing new in politics. Democrats traditionally hold an edge with women. But these numbers show that the gap is growing wider and is in danger of becoming a chasm. If it gets wide enough, it could pull the GOP down into it.","republicandemocrat gender

For many across the country and some in this Deep South state, Republican Roy Moore is the bad guy.

Before accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls surfaced, he had twice lost his seat on the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal orders to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments that he'd built at his courthouse and to abide by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. And his commentary on a range of issues — from homosexuality to slavery — has offended Democrats and some moderate Republicans here.

But for many white evangelical Christians, a dominant political force in the state, Moore is the hero in the latest high-stakes chapter of a centuries-long American morality play, a ""godly"" man beset by evil persecutors from outside the faith, outside the state and outside a value system in which Christianity, patriotism and the Republican Party are inextricably tied. Their views are so vital to Moore's chances because they account for 49 percent of adult Alabamians.

""They’ve taken evil and tried to redefine it as good and they’ve taken good in our society and redefined it as evil,"" said Franklin Raddish, the South Carolina-based founder of Capitol Hill Independent Baptist Ministries, a Moore supporter who set up a Bible study group at the Alabama Supreme Court. ""It’s a culture war of right and wrong.""

For Raddish, the ""they"" refers to ""socialists,"" and, he said, ""the Democrat Party is the party of socialists.""

Raddish said pastors who support Moore in Alabama have become reluctant to talk to reporters for fear of being misquoted and receiving the kinds of harassing calls and emails he said he has fielded. NBC's requests to interview several evangelical pastors in the state went unanswered.

At a Pensacola, Fla., campaign rally Friday night in which President Donald Trump issued a full-throated endorsement of Moore, the president explained the us-versus-them mentality as a conflict between God and secularism.

""We've stopped the government's attacks on our Judeo-Christian values,"" Trump said. ""We don't worship government, we worship God.""

To Moore's supporters, Democrat Doug Jones — the former prosecutor who won decades-overdue convictions against men who participated in the 16th Street church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham in 1963 — has become an embodiment of evil. Not only does he represent a party that supports abortion rights, but he told NBC's Chuck Todd in September that he does not back efforts to restrict abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Abortion

There is no social or political issue of greater import to white evangelical Christians than abortion, and the Senate's role in confirming federal judges makes it the single-most galvanizing issue for them in this race. Federal judges hold the power to rule on whether state-level restrictions violate the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion and, at the Supreme Court level, to potentially overturn that ruling.

""I don't think you'll be very successful in Alabama ... being a person who supports abortion through the ninth month,"" said Abraham Hamilton, general counsel and public policy analyst for the American Family Association, based in Tupelo, Miss.

Hamilton said it's not all about abortion, noting that the bill of particulars against Jones is much longer:

Jones was a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where President Barack Obama was unanimously re-nominated; he talks about defending the Second Amendment and his affinity for hunting, but also about the idea that some limitations on gun-owners' rights are consistent with the Constitution; and he opposes Trump's border wall — an issue with great support among Moore's faithful but on which white evangelical Christians are not monolithic.

And Jones backs same-sex marriage, the issue over which Moore lost his state Supreme Court post the second time and which ranks a close second to abortion as a hot button for religious conservatives.

But much of it boils down to the notion that Jones — who was born in Fairfield, and educated at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Samford University in Homewood — represents the kind of outsider that Moore and many white evangelical Christians here have been fighting not only on modern social matters but since the Civil War, Reconstruction and the Civil Rights era.

At a rally in Florence in September, Moore was asked when the United States was last great. His response, as reported by The Los Angeles Times: ""I think it was great at the time when families were united — even though we had slavery — they cared for one another. ... Our families were strong, our country had a direction.""

Almost every line of argument against Jones starts with his connections to politicians and groups outside Alabama that are perceived by evangelical Christians to be hostile to their cause.

On Friday, Trump called him a ""puppet"" of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. And when former Vice President Joe Biden came to the state to support Jones last month, Alabama Republican Party Chair Terry Lathan said she'd welcome national Democrats and their allies — the abortion-rights group Planned Parenthood specifically — because of the backlash that would rally the evangelical-laden GOP.

No matter who attacks Moore, whether it's Democrats or Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said he believed the GOP candidate's accusers and called on him to drop out of the race, the critic is cast in the role of outsider persecutor. The fact that the attacks come from Washington, where the federal government sent troops to fight the Confederacy and integrate schools only adds to the familiarity of the battle lines.

Heath Carter, a historian at Indiana's Valparaiso University who studies evangelical Christianity in political reform movements, said that Moore's supporters see him as the protagonist fighting against those seeking to undermine their faith and culture.

""It fits right into a narrative that's been up and running for a long time: These types of attacks will come,"" Carter said. ""It’s part of being a true believer.

A 'Godly' man

In mid-November, at a firehouse in northeastern Alabama, the candidate's wife, Kayla Moore, called her husband a ""godly"" man. ""He has never one time lifted a finger to me. He is the most gentle, most kind man that I have ever known in my life. He's godly. He's loving, and everybody in this community knows it,"" she said.

It can be hard for some to reconcile that description with the allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers decades ago — which Moore has repeatedly denied — and with the support that Trump enjoys from evangelical Christian voters despite the many women who have said the president physically accosted them before he was elected.

Stephanie Martin, an assistant professor of political communicatiions at Southern Methodist University who studies conservative political movements, said Kayla Moore is trying to telegraph the idea that her husband ""sits as sort of the God-head of his family and he’s a protector and a provider and he is a leader and he takes his responsibilities to be masculine very seriously.""

In that telling, Martin said, the view is that women should trust Moore.

""It is kind of an anti-feminist supposition and it is a pro-traditional feminine notion,"" she said. ""So it says, 'OK, so he was interested in women who were much younger than him, but he never did it without her parents' permission.'""

Many of Moore's backers don't believe the allegations, some will support him despite the claims, and a handful have sought to justify his alleged pursuit of girls and young women as Christian.

""Take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus,"" Jim Ziegler, the Alabama state auditor told The Washington Examiner last month, noting that Moore isn't accused of having had sex with any underage girls. ""There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here. ... Maybe just a little bit unusual.""

The common response among voters has been that it's not up to them to judge Moore, only God can do that, and that they know him as a man of integrity.

Divisions within the faith

Trump remains popular with Alabamians. A Morning Consult survey in October pegged his approval rating at 59 percent in a state he won with 62 percent of the vote. His recent declaration that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, mentioned by Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., at Trump's Friday night rally, was immensely popular with evangelicals who believe that Jewish control of Jerusalem is a predicate for the second coming of Jesus Christ.

But there are signs of wear in his relationship with white evangelical Christians across the country.

A Pew Research poll released this week shows that Trump's approval rating among white evangelical Christians dropped from 78 percent in February to 61 percent now.

Some evangelical leaders, particularly those outside the Deep South, have been vocal in their criticism of the president and of Moore. They worry about the faith's connection to partisan politics — that the desire to elect certain candidates and promote certain policies has led religious leaders to turn a blind eye.

Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, has risked his post in part by being critical of Trump and Moore. ""The religious right,"" he said in an October 2016 speech, ""turns out to be the people the religious right warned us about.""

And, after the allegations against Moore surfaced, he took to Twitter to denounce evangelicals who gave him a pass.

Christian, if you cannot say definitively, no matter what, that adults creeping on teenage girls is wrong, do not tell me how you stand against moral relativism. — Russell Moore (@drmoore) November 13, 2017

Historically, there's been a divide between northern and southern white evangelicals, with the former having often been deeply involved in social reform movements, such as abolition, civil rights and labor rights efforts, that were resisted in the Deep South.

Carter, the Valparaiso professor, described the modern divide as more of clash between religious intellectual elites and rank-and-file pastors and their flocks. Like Moore, the elites want to define morality more along religious lines and less around politics.

He said that for many adherents to the various denominations that make up evangelicalism religion ""mixes very freely"" with nationalism and Republicanism.

That helps explain why Moore's supporters frame Tuesday's election as an assault on their faith, their party and their country.

""The stakes in this particular race can appear to be cosmic and eternal,"" Carter said, ""and that gets people pretty motivated.""","democratic national convention

It wasn’t just a matter of being unhappy. She always felt empty and miserable — never content or connected to other children. For years, she suffered alone, filled with shame. She switched schools, but that didn’t help.

“I didn't feel unloved. I just felt numb to the world. Like, I was surrounded by great things, but just I couldn't be happy. And I didn't know why that was,” Alex told NBC News.

Tune in to NBC Nightly News Sunday night for more

Finally, at 14, she decided to break her silence. ""I can't feel anything,"" Alex simply told her mother, Heather Olson of New York. “So she just gave me a hug, cradled me in her arms on the bed, and was like, ‘Well can you feel me? Can you feel my love?’”

“A hug and kisses was the only thing that came to mind at the spur of the moment, but that was precisely what she needed to start the journey forward,” Olson said.

Alex was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. Now 16, she is in therapy and on medication. She’s far from alone.

There is an acute health crisis happening among members of the youngest generation of Americans, with critical implications for the country's future.

NBC News

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports one in five American children, ages 3 through 17 — some 15 million — have a diagnosable mental, emotional or behavioral disorder in a given year.

Only 20 percent of these children are ever diagnosed and receive treatment; 80 percent — some 12 million — are not receiving treatment.

Recent research indicates serious depression is worsening in teens, especially girls and the suicide rate among girls reached a 40-year high in 2015, according to a CDC report released in August.

“Child and adolescent mental health disorders are the most common illnesses that children will experience under the age of 18. It's pretty amazing because the number's so large that I think it's hard to wrap our heads around it,” said Dr. Harold Koplewicz, founding president of The Child Mind Institute.

Over the next few months, NBC Nightly News will examine the state of American children’s mental health, including reports on what has led to this increase — especially in anxiety and depression — treatment obstacles, promising research and innovative programs to help children.

Is your toddler depressed?

Mental health problems may actually start much earlier than previously thought.

A toddler who is crying for hours and angrily stomping his feet may not be having a temper tantrum, but showing signs of depression. Research suggests 1 to 2 percent of children 2 to 5 years old have depression, said Dr. Joan Luby, director of the Early Emotional Development program at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and a pioneer in the study of the condition in preschoolers.

She believes untreated depression in toddlers can lead to more depression later in life.

“Young children are more cognitively sophisticated, more emotionally sophisticated than we previously understood. They have complex emotions. They're aware of emotions in their environment. They feel emotions like guilt,” Luby said. “They have all the prerequisites of what depressive symptoms are.”

That may show up as constant sadness and low self-esteem. A child may not want to play with a favorite toy or her friends over a sustained period of time.

Vickey Harper of St. Louis became worried when her 2-year-old daughter Myla began having “scary” tantrums that sometimes lasted almost an hour. The girl would scream, kick and hit her mother in the face.

“My gut was just telling me that something was not right,” Harper said. Mental illness runs in the family, but she was surprised when doctors suggested Myla had depression.

The girl is taking part in Luby’s research to see if early intervention can make a difference. Parents are coached on how to play with and respond to their kids — exercises meant to help kids recognize their emotions, like being sad, angry or nervous. The hope is that will help them learn to control those feelings and “change a lifelong trajectory,” or prevent episodes of depression later in life, Luby said.

Now, Myla’s long tantrums are gone.

“She is not the same kid that walked into those therapy sessions,” Harper said. “She can tell me when she's feeling something. She still yells sometimes, but it's on a much smaller scale.”

Why adolescents are so vulnerable

Teens are known for their moodiness, and adolescence — a particularly turbulent time of life — is actually one of the most vulnerable periods to develop anxiety and depression. Some 50 percent of cases of mental illness begin by age 14, according to the American Psychiatric Association. A prevalence to develop depression and bipolar disorder nearly doubles from age 13 to age 18.

But for teens like Alex Crotty, depression is very different than adolescent angst, Koplewicz said.

“Teenagers have a different kind of depression. They don't seem sad, they seem irritable,” he noted. “This really has an effect on your concentration, which will affect school; it will affect your desire to continue playing sports, it'll affect your desire of being with your friends.”

Related: Suicides in teen girls hit 40-year high

Warning signs also include the duration and the degree of symptoms, he said. Take notice if your teen is experiencing moodiness or irritability for more than two weeks and it's occurring every day, for most of the day, plus you see a change in sleep patterns and a change in desire to work and socialize.

Teenagers also think about suicide more often — and 5,000 young people actually take their own lives every year in the U.S., Koplewicz added.

For years, Alex was too scared to reach out for help because she thought that if she told her parents about her depression, they wouldn’t believe her or overreact and send her to a “psych ward,” she said.

It’s why The Child Mind Institute is collecting brain scans from 10,000 children and teens, hoping to identify biological markers of psychiatric illness. The project could improve the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.

After medication and therapy, Alex is doing great.

“I am so much stronger after coming out of this,” she said, urging other kids to speak up. “If you always feel like something's wrong, talk to somebody. If you feel like you're blaming things on yourself all the time, talk to somebody. Just if things don't feel good, talk to somebody.”","washington university school of medicine

Variety,Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme kicked photographer Chelsea Lauren in the face on stage during a holiday concert. He apologized on Sunday.,2017-12-11T00:52:26Z,nbc-news,Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age apologizes for kicking photographer in face,http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/josh-homme-queens-stone-age-apologizes-kicking-photographer-face-n828216,https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/2256226/171210-josh-homme-se-140p_06e6e1b8efa84396ac8723b16659ae95.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"LOS ANGELES — Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme apologized Sunday for kicking a photographer in the face during a performance.

Chelsea Lauren, a photographer for Shutterstock, which has a licensing partnership with Variety owner Penske Media, said that the incident during the band's performance at Los Angeles radio station KROQ's annual holiday concert on Saturday was entirely unprovoked and that Homme was even smiling before he struck her.

""It was obviously very intentional,"" she said.

Homme released a statement Sunday characterizing the incident as an accident.

""Last night, while in a state of being lost in performance, I kicked over various lighting and equipment on our stage,"" the statement reads. ""Today it was brought to my attention that this included a camera held by photographer Chelsea Lauren. I did not mean for that to happen and I am very sorry. I would never intentionally cause harm to anyone working at or attending one of our shows and I hope Chelsea will accept my sincere apology.""

Lauren was on one side of the stage while three other photographers were together on the other side of the stage. In the video, Homme can be seen walking past Lauren, then backtracking a step to kick away her camera.

""Josh was coming over, and I was pretty excited. I've never actually photographed Queens of the Stone Age before. I was really looking forward to it. I saw him coming over, and I was shooting away,"" Lauren said.

""The next thing I know, his foot connects with my camera, and my camera connects with my face really hard. He looked straight at me, swung his leg back pretty hard and full-blown kicked me in the face,"" she said. ""He continued performing. I was startled. I kind of stopped looking at him. I just got down and was holding my face 'cause it hurt so badly.""

A visibly distraught Lauren returned to the press room with tears welling up in her eyes. When several people asked her what happened, she said, disbelief still in her voice: ""Josh kicked me in the face. Who does that?""

Backing up her claim that several audience members saw it as it happened, a rep from KROQ in the press room received a text from someone sitting in the seats above asking, ""Did the guitarist for Queens Of The Stone Age kick a photographer in the face?""

Lauren stayed to shoot ""Thirty Seconds to Mars"" and ""Muse,"" but she went for treatment later Saturday night at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

""I feel like if I don't do anything, he gets to walk around and kick people in the face and not get in trouble because he's a musician,"" Lauren said. ""That's not right.""

Lauren said that minutes after the incident, Homme took out what appeared to be a knife after the lights went down and cut his own forehead, spewing blood for the rest of the performance as she cried just steps away. (Wrestlers dubbed what Homme did himself as ""blading,"" or intentional cutting to provoke bleeding.)

It's unknown whether Homme, 44, was under the influence of alcohol or drugs on Saturday. At one point, he called the sold-out audience ""retards"" before insulting the night's headlining act, Muse. ""F--- Muse!"" he exclaimed.

He also encouraged the crowd to boo him and told everyone to take their pants off, saying, ""I want to give you all a night you'll never remember."" In the press room, before Lauren returned and told everyone what happened, people jokingly questioned, ""What is he on?""

A rep for the Queens of the Stone Age could not be reached for comment.

Lauren, who spoke to Variety immediately after the incident, as well as over the phone on Sunday morning, said she planned to return to the Forum to shoot the final night of KROQ's gala on Sunday, which featured the Killers, Weezer and Phoenix.

She added: ""I really love shooting music, and while I feel awful today, if I stop for him, then he wins.""

She was reminded that her injury was a bizarre and unfortunate circumstance on a night when everybody else seemed to be in great spirits.

""I was getting on the elevator when I walked past Tim McIlarth from Rise Against,"" she said. ""He smiled at me, and I was reminded there are a lot of good guys in music still.""","the

Five fires covering more than 200,000 acres raged across California on Sunday, with 9,000 firefighters combating the flames, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire.

More than 800 homes and structures have been destroyed and 98,000 people have been forced to evacuate, according to Cal Fire. The ongoing blazes are threatening 25,000 homes.

The largest fire, the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, spanned 173,000 acres and was only 15 percent contained as of Sunday morning, according to Cal Fire.

The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office issued evacuation orders on Sunday for the area spanning Buena Vista Dr. to Toro Canyon Road from SR-192 north to Camino Cielo. Evacuation warnings for parts of Montecito, Carpinteria and Summerland were also expanded on Sunday.

One death has been blamed on the Thomas Fire, which broke out on Monday. The body of Virginia Pesola, 70, was discovered at a car crash site along a fire evacuation route in Ventura County on Wednesday night, according to the county medical examiner’s office.

""Moderate Santa Ana winds pushed the fire last night and will continue through early this afternoon causing the fire to burned actively with significant growth in the Carpinteria area,"" the fire agency said on its website. ""The fire continues to burn actively to the north, east, and west.""

On Sunday afternoon, mandatory evacuations were lifted in the unincorporated areas east and north of Santa Paula's city limits.

The fierce Santa Ana winds were forecast to continue bringing a high fire danger throughout Southern California on Sunday, according to Weather Channel meteorologist Chris Dolce. The winds were expected to subside within the week ahead, but there was still no forecast of the rain in the immediate foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, firefighters in the state were still dealing with the Lilac Fire in San Diego County, which has burned 4,100 acres and was 60 percent on Sunday, according to Cal Fire.

The Creek Fire in Los Angeles County has burned 15,619 acres and was 90 percent while the Rye Fire in Los Angeles County burned 6,049 acres and was also 90 percent contained, according to the fire authority.

Fire officials warned that the threat of the blazes was becoming a year-round challenge.

""It's December, and it's amazing to be able to say we aren’t out of fire season,"" Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott told reporters Saturday. ""And this is the challenge that we face in California and certainly here in Southern California, that it is a year-round challenge that we are all in.""

California Gov. Jerry Brown added that the state faces a ""new normal"" when it comes to wildfires that is exacerbated by climate change.

""We're facing a new reality in this state, where fires threaten people’s lives, their property, their neighborhoods, and of course billions and billions of dollars,"" Brown said at a news conference. He called California a ""very wonderful place, but a place that’s getting hotter.""

""We're about ready to have firefighting at Christmas,"" Brown said. ""This is very odd and unusual.""

Parts of Northern California were devastated by wildfires in October, which killed more than 40 people and destroyed around 8,900 homes and other structures.","california department of forestry

""I know that he was elected,"" Haley said, ""but, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.”

Trump was subpoenaed earlier this year in a lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former “The Apprentice” contestant who alleged that Trump tried to kiss and touch her inappropriately without her consent at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007.

The former South Carolina governor also said that she was proud of all the women who have come forward to share their stories of sexual misconduct in numerous industries across the country.

And, the ambassador said, it’s time to take part in this important cultural moment.

He graduated from the police academy and then, nine and a half years ago, took a job with the Eatonville Police Department, where he remained “because they were the first ones who gave [him] the opportunity.”

But now, the 45-year-old corporal is saying he was dismissed from the force Monday — six months before he was due to be vested in its pension system — because he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after being one of the first to respond to the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando.

On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen opened fire and took hostages at the LGBT-friendly nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring dozens more. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Delgado returned to patrol duty for a few months after the shooting, but said he decided to stop. For the past eight months, he has been working a desk job answering phones, recording fingerprints and completing similar administrative tasks.

And on Tuesday night, the Eatonville Town Council voted unanimously to pay Delgado $1,200 before taxes in accrued sick time, and designated Dec. 31 as his last day of work, The Orlando Sentinel reported.

Delgado, a married father of three, said the gravity of his dismissal hit him while watching a local news story about it with his 9-year-old daughter.

“My mouth dropped, and she asked me why am I not going to be a police officer anymore,” he told NBC News. “I had to tell her it was because I’m sick. It’s a challenge to try and explain something like that to a 9-year-old and a 10-year-old.”

Delgado said he will begin receiving 42 percent of his $38,500 annual salary a decade from now, when he’s 55 years old.

The Eatonville Police Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment by NBC News.

Angel Colon, who was rescued by Delgado after being shot six times during the massacre, denounced the department for terminating the man who saved him.

“He saved my life and for them to just do what they're doing to him in front of my face is a slap to my face as well,” Colon told WFTV. “He did his job that night on June 12, so they should have his back 100 percent.”

Ever since the massacre, Delgado has regularly woken up screaming after having the same nightmare about the carnage he witnessed that night in Orlando. He said he can only sleep between three and five hours each night — even on medication.

“After that night, it was hell,” Delgado said. “Just trying to continue my life with visions of what I witnessed. No man should ever have to do that.”

The officer said he has difficulty being in bars, restaurants or anywhere that’s noisy with crowds of people. He said he constantly fears that an event similar to the massacre will happen wherever he goes.

“I just don’t live my life the way I did before what happened at Pulse,” Delgado said. “I feel bad, and I can see myself deteriorating away because I don’t do the things I enjoyed doing before. I’d rather be home — I’d rather stay in my room.”

According to Florida state law, workers who endure psychological trauma on the job are not entitled to paid days off or medical bill reimbursement by their employers.

But a new bill that advanced in the Florida Senate Tuesday might lead to a policy change.

Senate Bill 376 would require coverage for PTSD treatment in workers’ compensation insurance for first responders who witnessed or responded to the scene of a child death, murder, suicide, fatal injury or mass-casualty incident.

On Wednesday, multiple Central Florida lawmakers responded to Delgado's termination by calling for workers’ compensation for first responders coping with work-related mental health issues.

Shortly after learning of his dismissal, Delgado said he received an outpouring of support from friends, family and community members.

A GoFundMe account that was created on his behalf had collected more than $35,000 as of Friday morning. Delgado said he is grateful for the support, but still wishes he had his job — especially now during the holiday season.

“You expect your country to take care of you,” he said. “I thought my department would’ve taken care of me, and that’s not the case.”","eatonville town council

Scarlett Lewis remembers a time when she thought she could never forgive.

It was long before Dec. 14, 2012, the day a 20-year-old gunman killed her 6-year-old son, Jesse, and 25 others at Sandy Hook Elementary in one of the worst mass murders in U.S history.

Three years before that day, Jesse slept next to her in bed as she read a book called “Left To Tell,” by a Rwandan genocide survivor who forgave the people who killed her family. With 3-year-old Jesse snuggled safely in the crook of her arm, she remembers thinking, “I would never forgive someone who hurt my family. NEVER.”

“And I meant it,” she adds now, in the house that will forever seem quiet to her.

So she understands when people can’t comprehend her forgiveness for Adam Lanza, her son’s murderer. For her, there was no other choice — her pain was an anchor dragging her down. Now she devotes her days to spreading a program she thinks could have saved her son, and Adam, from their intertwined fates: it's called social and emotional learning.

A message from Jesse: Nurturing, healing love

It started with three words Jesse wrote on her kitchen chalkboard before he left for school on Dec. 14. She almost never saw them. At first, Lewis thought she might not return to the Newtown, Connecticut farmhouse where she raised Jesse and his older brother, J.T., now 17. It was so full of memories of Jesse and his loud boy energy. Even now, she unearths his beloved little green Army men in the corners of closets and under rocks in her garden.

Courtesy Lewis Family/Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement Scarlett Lewis remembers her son Jesse, murdered at age 6, as always happy, loud and full of energy. ""He was exactly how a little boy is supposed to be,"" she says.

But she went home for the first time since the shooting to choose clothes for Jesse to wear at his funeral. She could have asked someone else to do it, but she wanted to pick them out herself because it was a frigid December. She didn’t want her little boy to be cold.

Carrying his warm clothes, she turned the corner to walk into her kitchen and she saw it.

“Nurturing Healing Love,” Jesse had scrawled on the chalkboard. She stopped short. “Oh my God,” she whispered. “Has anybody seen this?”

Jesse was a lovebug, Lewis says, but it’s not like that phrase was part of a 6-year-old's everyday vocabulary. She felt sure it meant something, and it was up to her to figure it out. A therapist referred her to a college professor who told her he’d do some research. He called back to tell her those three words showed up again and again in the definition of compassion across cultures. It was a formula for choosing love over hate.

“I knew immediately, if Adam Lanza had felt nurturing, healing love, this would not have happened,” Lewis says. She told the professor they had to get this message into schools — but how? “Well,” he said, “it’s called social and emotional learning.”

Courtesy Lewis Family/Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement Scarlett and Jesse Lewis. After his murder at Sandy Hook, Lewis said, a lot of people blamed Adam Lanza's mom (who was also his first murder victim), but as a single parent herself, Lewis was struck by the similarities in their lives.

Social and emotional learning: 'These programs work'

Lewis dove into research. Social and emotional learning, or SEL, is making its way into schools across the country. Put simply, it’s teaching children how to understand and manage their emotions, cultivate empathy and develop positive relationships.

It can sound a bit soft-and-cuddly, especially when schools are under pressure to raise test scores. But here's the thing: SEL actually does raise test scores, according to research, by an average of 11 percentage points. Even 18 years later, studies have shown that students exposed to SEL training in school have better academics, score higher on skills like empathy and teamwork, have fewer emotional problems and lower rates of drug use.

""We’re not saying, 'Grab a guitar and come sing around the campfire,'"" says Tim Shriver, board chair of CASEL, which provides research and policy support for social and emotional learning in schools. ""We’re an evidence-based movement.""

With help from friends, Lewis founded the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement and combined the most effective elements of SEL school programs out there into one curriculum, and made it free.

Roger Sieber Scarlett Lewis speaks to students and educators around the country, spreading a message from her son Jesse that she wishes Adam Lanza had heard during his brief, unhappy life: The power of nurturing, healing love.

About half of U.S. schools now have some sort of SEL component, says Shriver, who is also chairman of the Special Olympics. Lewis's program, he said, stands out because of Jesse's story, and also for its frank emphasis on love and forgiveness. The number of SEL programs in schools is steadily growing because principals and teachers demand them, he says: ""The evidence shows how effective it is. These programs work. Schools get better.""

A message from Rwanda

Another encounter after Jesse’s death put Lewis and her older son J.T. on the path to forgiveness. As the news of the Sandy Hook shooting circled the globe, a group of orphaned Rwandan genocide survivors heard about it. Through an aide worker who knew someone who knew someone in Newtown, they got on a Skype call with Lewis and J.T.

Their message: “You’re going to be OK, and you’re going to feel joy again.""

Roger Sieber Jesse's older brother, J.T., is now 17 and avoids the spotlight, but their mother Scarlett says J.T.'s courage in moving on and using his pain to help others inspires her daily.

Lewis finally got an answer to the question that haunted her years ago, when everyone she loved was safe and she couldn’t imagine forgiving someone who hurt her kids.

“We realized we had to forgive the killers,” one of the Rwandan survivors told them, “or we would go down the same path.”

“All right, God,” Lewis remembers thinking. “I’m listening.”

It has been five years since Jesse’s murder. J.T. started an organization called Newtown Helps Rwanda and raises money to send orphaned Rwandan genocide survivors to college. The Jesse Lewis Choose Love program on social and emotional learning has reached about 150,000 students in 47 states and 17 countries.

Since Sandy Hook, the record for the worst mass shooting in U.S. history has been surpassed several times over. Orlando. Las Vegas. Every time there’s a mass shooting, Lewis knows, people will feel sad and powerless. Her message: You have power; use it.

“I have realized in the past four years how incredibly powerful we are,” she says. When Adam Lanza stepped into her son’s classroom, his gun jammed or he briefly ran out of bullets, and Jesse shouted at his friends to run. Nine did, and survived.

“If Jesse could use the last moments of his life to save his friends, I certainly can get up every morning and do everything in my power to ensure we have a safer, more peaceful, loving world.... You don’t think you have that courage, but you do. We all have that courage Jesse showed on that day. It’s the courage to be kind and gentle, to do the right thing, to forgive, to step outside of our own pain. That’s the courage to choose love.”","the

The leftovers from the first neutron star smashup we’ve ever seen have surprised us. The beam of light that jetted out of the explosion has gotten even brighter in the three months since the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and other observatories spotted the collision. This brightening may mean that similar jets of x-rays and gamma radiation are more complicated than we thought.

At the beginning of December, astronomers used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to take another look at the spot where we watched a neutron star smash-up in August. They saw three times more X-ray radiation in the area than directly after the explosion that generated the gravitational waves LIGO saw.

Andy Coghlan,Two gene variants have been found to be more common in gay men. New Scientist looks at what this tells us about the way biology shapes our sexuality,2017-12-07T00:00:00Z,new-scientist,What do the new ‘gay genes’ tell us about sexual orientation?,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2155810-what-do-the-new-gay-genes-tell-us-about-sexual-orientation/,https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07134210/gettyimages-803015808.jpg,science-and-nature,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Inti Ocon/AFP?Getty

Two gene variants have been found to be more common in gay men, adding to mounting evidence that sexual orientation is at least partly biologically determined. How does this change what we already knew?

Didn’t we already know there were “gay genes”?

We have known for decades that sexual orientation is partly heritable in men, thanks to studies of families in which some people are straight and some people are gay. In 1993, genetic variations in a region on the X chromosome in men were linked to whether they were heterosexual or homosexual, and in 1995, a region on chromosome 8 was identified. Both findings were confirmed in a study of gay and straight brothers in 2014. However, these studies didn’t home in on any specific genes on this chromosome.

What’s new about the latest study?

For the first time, individual genes have been identified that may influence how sexual orientation develops in boys and men, both in the womb and during life. Alan Sanders at North Shore University, Illinois, and his team pinpointed these genes by comparing DNA from 1077 gay and 1231 straight men. They scanned the men’s entire genomes, looking for single-letter differences in their DNA sequences. This enabled them to home in on two genes whose variants seem to be linked to sexual orientation.

What genes did they find and what do they do?

One of the genes, which sits on chromosome 13, is active in a part of the brain called the diencephalon. Interestingly, this brain region contains the hypothalamus, which was identified in 1991 as differing in size between gay and straight men. This was discovered by neuroscientist Simon LeVay, who says he is excited that the gene discovery seems to fit with what he found.

Other research has found that this gene, called SLITRK6, is active in the hypothalamus of male mice fetuses a few days before they are born. “This is thought to be a crucial time for sexual differentiation in this part of the brain,” says LeVay. “So this particular finding is a potential link between the neuroanatomy and molecular genetics of sexual orientation.

What is the other gene?

This gene is found on chromosome 14 and is mainly active in the thyroid, but also the brain. Called TSHR, it makes a type of receptor protein that recognises and binds to a hormone that stimulates the thyroid. In this way, the gene plays an important role in controlling thyroid function.

The fact that TSHR seems to be involved in sexual orientation fits with evidence that thyroid function seems to be linked to sexuality. For instance, TSHR function is disrupted in a genetic condition called Grave’s disease, which causes the thyroid gland to become over-active, accelerating metabolism and leading to weight-loss. Grave’s disease is more common in gay than straight men, and some research suggests that gay men tend to be thinner – which might possibly be a result of thyroid overdrive.

Are all men who have the “gay” variants of these genes gay?

No, says Sanders, because many other factors play a role, including the environment. “There are probably multiple genes involved, each with a fairly low effect,” he says. “There will be men who have the form of gene that increases the chance of being gay, but they won’t be gay.”

Because many genes and other factors seem likely to play a role in sexual orientation, this may explain why some people are bisexual or see sexual orientation as a spectrum.

What about women who are gay? Are there “lesbian genes”?

Our biological understanding of homosexuality in women lags behind. Some researchers say this is partly because women who have sex with women tend to be more fluid in their sexual orientation.

There have been studies suggesting that there is a genetic element to homosexuality in women, but more research has been done in men, says Sanders.

Why should we care about the genetics of being gay?

The latest findings open the prospect to identifying the whole pathway of genes involved in both homosexual and heterosexual orientation, says Dean Hamer at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the study that pinpointed chromosome X back in 1993. “It adds yet more evidence that sexual orientation is not a ‘lifestyle choice’. But the real significance is that it takes us one step closer to understanding the origins of one of the most fascinating and important features of human beings.”

Our solar system’s first interstellar visitor may be a shard of a larger planet that got shredded by its star.

Astronomers spotted a strange, fast-moving object in October that seems to be an interloper from beyond our solar system. Named ‘Oumuamua, it seems to be a cigar-shaped rock that tumbled into our neighbourhood from around another star.

Now, researchers are trying to figure out where ‘Oumuamua came from and how it formed. Matija Cuk at the SETI Institute thinks it may have been born when a planet about 10 times the size of Earth got too close to its small, dense star and was shredded to bits. The debris could have been punted away by the gravitational tug of a second orbiting star.

A wildfire has ripped through one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods in the US, damaging Rupert Murdoch’s $28.8 million vineyard estate in the Santa Monica mountains at the edge of Los Angeles.

The media-mogul’s palatial house was saved, thanks to firefighters who spent the afternoon and night battling the conflagration. Others weren’t so lucky. Hundreds of homes and scores of lives have been lost in both northern and southern California in a spate of recent wildfires that were fiercer and moved faster than any in recent memory.

Such fires are made more likely as the world warms. California has just had its hottest summer on record, and the recent wildfires came much later in the year than normal. We also know that seven of California’s 10 largest recorded wildfires have occurred in the last 14 years.

The older your mother was when you were born, the less likely you are to have children – but we don’t know why. An analysis of thousands of women has found that daughters of older mums are more likely to be childless – an effect that can’t be fully explained by social factors like wealth or education.

So far, there’s been mixed evidence over whether parental age at first birth is linked to lower fertility in children. There does seem to be a trend that women who are wealthier and more educated are more likely to give birth later in life – and wealth tends to be passed down the generations for multiple reasons.

But Olga Basso, of McGill University in Montreal, Canada, is interested in whether there might also be biological factors that make the children of older parents less likely","mcgill university in montreal canada

US INTELLIGENCE agencies have been looking pretty stupid recently. Since last year, a group called the Shadow Brokers has been releasing cyberweapons stolen from the US National Security Agency. The WannaCry ransomware attack that knocked out computers across the world and shut down UK hospitals earlier this year, was powered by one of these weapons, exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft code.

The NSA is not sure how many other pieces of its arsenal have been leaked. “The US is battling a rearguard action with respect to its reputation,” says Tim Stevens at King’s College London.

If the US had lost control of a nuclear warhead, there would be global outrage, because a web of international treaties govern these dangerous weapons. But cyberweapons, which could cripple a nation’s infrastructure, come under no such regulations.

Ding dong! That’ll be the robot with my pizza. Such a scenario probably seems a bit far-fetched but, in the US and UK, delivery firms like JustEat and DoorDash are already experimenting using small robots to deliver groceries and meals.

Currently these systems need human chaperones to monitor the robot’s progress, jumping in if it gets into trouble. But now Kiwi, a company based at the University of California, Berkeley, is using machine learning to teach its delivery robots how to cross the road safely, without any human intervention. It could be an important step in making these robots more autonomous, something that is vital if they are ever going to be delivering our dinners at scale.

The strange supernova that just kept exploding may not be quite so weird, after all.

Most supernovae brighten once as they explode and then fade, but one that was first spotted three years ago has brightened five times so far and has only just started to dim over the past few months. Researchers thought it might be a new kind of explosion, but new observations show it might be a regular supernova whose light is lent extra power by a dense disc of debris.

Iair Arcavi at University of California, Santa Barbara, and his colleagues first saw supernova iPTF4hls in September 2014 and noticed that while its light spectrum was fairly normal, it was far brighter and longer-lasting than expected.

Speaking at the rally just over the state line from Alabama, in Pensacola, Florida, Trump joined the Moore campaign in questioning the claims of one of the candidate’s alleged victims, Beverley Young Nelson, who on Friday said that she had added an inscription to a high school yearbook signed by Moore.

“Did you see what happened today? You know, the yearbook? Did you see that? There was a little mistake made,” said Trump. “She started writing things in the yearbook.” He went on to attack the credibility of her lawyer, Gloria Allred. “Any time you see her you know something’s gone wrong.”

Young has used the signature as evidence for her claim that Moore assaulted her in 1977, when he was working as an assistant district attorney and she was a 16-year-old waitress.

Moore has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct, blaiming the claims on a conspiracy by “lesbians, gays, bisexuals and socialists.”

The Daily Beast reported Wednesday that Trump has told confidants that he believes in Moore's innocence, placing him at odds with senior Republicans such as House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who have said they believe Moore's accusers. McConnell has since moderated his stance, saying it was up to the Alabama voters to decide whether to vote for Moore.

At the rally, Trump also criticized Moore’s opponent, Democratic candidate Doug Jones, and said that Jones is ""completely controlled by (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi and (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer.""

“We want jobs, jobs, jobs, so get out and vote for Roy Moore,” said Trump, wrapping up his pitch.

Trump has initially been cautious about offering his full support for Moore, who has been accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl and sexually assaulting several other teenagers and women. But in recent days, the president has leant his full support to Moore, tweeting Friday: “LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!”

Polls show the race uncharacteristically tight in the normally safe Republican seat, four days before the special election.","moore nicholas kammafpgetty

In a separate statement, the Iraqi military declared the country “totally liberated” from ISIS.

The U.S. led Operation Inherent Resolve, which was formed to defeat ISIS, also announced the victory in a statement on Twitter.

The announcement comes two days after the Russian military announced the defeat of the militants in neighboring Syria, where Moscow is backing Syrian government forces.

The Iraqi forces recaptured the last areas still under IS control along the border with Syria, state television quoted Abadi as telling an Arab media conference in Baghdad.

Several squadrons of Iraqi helicopters flew over Baghdad carrying Iraqi flags at noon, in an apparent rehearsal for a victory parade that Iraq is planning to hold in the coming days.

ISIS seized control of swaths of Iraq and Syria in a lightning campaign in 2014, but in recent months has been ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria.

Mosul, its de-facto Iraqi capital, was re-taken by Iraqi government forces backed by U.S. led coalition airstrikes in July after months of pitched battle. Raqqa, the organisation's Syrian base and self-declared capital, was retaken by Arab and Kurdish militias in September.

Last month, Baghdad announced that its forces had driven ISIS from Rawa, the last Iraqi town near the Syrian border still was held by the group.

“Our heroic armed forces have now secured the entire length of the Iraq-Syria border. We defeated Daesh through our unity and sacrifice for the nation. Long live Iraq and its people,"" Abadi said in a tweet Saturday.

The forces fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria now expect a new phase of guerrilla warfare, a tactic the militants have already shown themselves capable of.","islamic state isis

Palestinian Islamist Hamas group said two of its men were killed in the bombings.

Militants fired at least three rockets towards Israeli towns from the Hamas-controlled strip on Friday, which was declared a “day of rage” by Palestinian factions protesting U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Two of the rockets landed within Gaza, while a third exploded near the Israeli town of Sderot. No casulaties were reported.

“IAF (Israeli Air Force) aircraft targeted four facilities belonging to the Hamas terror organisation in the Gaza Strip: Two weapons manufacturing sites, a weapons warehouse, a military compound,” the Israeli military said in a statement.

A Hamas source confirmed the two men killed in the strikes belonged to the group, which urged Palestinians to keep up confrontation with Israeli forces.

Two more Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops on the Gaza border on Friday and scores more were wounded there and in the occupied West Bank during the protests.

Earlier on Friday, Fathi Hammad, a senior Hamas leader, said anyone seeking to move their embassy to Jerusalem was ""an enemy of the Palestinians.""

Across the Arab and Muslim worlds, thousands more protesters took to the streets on the Muslim holy day to express solidarity with the Palestinians and outrage at Trump’s reversal of decades of U.S. policy.

Trump’s announcement on Wednesday has infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies. The status of Jerusalem has been one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians for generations.

U.S. ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley on Friday justified the decision to recognize Jerusalem's capital, saying that the U.S. ""recognises the obvious; that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel"".

She said the US continued to be ""committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement"", and accused the UN of bias, saying it ""has outrageously been one of the world's foremost centres of hostility towards Israel.""

""Israel will never be, and never should be, bullied into an agreement by the United Nations or by any collection of countries that have proven their disregard for Israel's security,"" Haley said.

Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future independent state of their own.

Most countries, including the United States, still consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East War, to be occupied territory. It includes the Old City, home to sites considered holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians alike.

For decades, Washington, like most of the rest of the international community, held back from recognising any part Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, saying its status should be determined as part of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.

The Trump administration argues that the peace process has become moribund, and outdated policies need to be jettisoned for the sides in the conflict to make progress.

Trump also said he would fulfil his campaign promise and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, where no other country has an embassy.","israels security haley

Nova Scotia, a province on Canada’s eastern shore, announced on Thursday that the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation, its sole alcohol distributor, would sell the drug in its stores and on its website once Canada legalizes weed in July of next year.

""The NSLC has the experience and expertise to distribute and sell restricted products like alcohol and now cannabis in a socially responsible way,"" Justice Minister Mark Furey said at a press conference. ""We believe the NSLC is best positioned to sell cannabis, keeping it out of the hands of young people and making it legally available in a safe, regulated way.""

Experts say this has its downsides –– like for those recovering from alcoholism, who may be pushed into temptation if they want to purchase pot, for instance.

“Does it increase or decrease cannabis consumption and alcohol consumption to have the two together?” asked Mark Haden, a professor of public policy at the University of British Columbia School of Population and Public Health. He called the whole thing a “debate with no evidence” at this point.

But it also has its upsides –– liquor stores already have the brick-and-mortar locations, and have increased security and surveillance to make sure minors don’t buy alcohol, and to make sure no one steals it.

Nova Scotians will be allowed 30 grams (roughly 30 to 40 joints), and must be over the age of 19 to purchase marijuana. Canada will legalize the drug in July, but has left it up to its 10 provinces to decide where they will sell it, how much residents can have, and what the legal parameters around its dispensaries are. Ontario is also planning to sell its marijuana in liquor stores. Some provinces, however, are opting instead for government-run stores, like New Brunswick, where stores will ban advertising and window displays.

While provincial regulations are moving along quickly, governments are still scrambling to meet the rapidly approaching July 2018 deadline –– a timeline Quebec's public officials have called too fast. They've asked twice asked for a one-year extension to 2019 (and were denied).

The Nova Scotia government opened its policies up to an online survey, led by MQO Research. The vote was close –– 56 percent of respondents actually wanted standalone stores for marijuana rather than the two-in-one combination, while 49 percent said they liked the liquor store idea.

The NSLC has not responded to a request for comment.","nova scotia liquor corporation

Bret Tyer Skopek told Deadline he met Singer, 52, at a Halloween party in October 2013 shortly after arriving in Los Angeles as a fresh-faced 18-year-old from Arizona. By December, the aspiring singer was sleeping with the director. Their relationship ended in December 2014.

Skopek alleges that during his relationship with Singer, he was plunged into a lifestyle of lavish parties, expensive dinners, as well as copious alcohol, drug use and orgies. “You come [to LA] with dreams of being whatever. You’re still going to be caught up into this mess,” he said.

Skopek says he fell into Singer’s orbit after becoming acquaintances with a computer technician, who was friends with the director. The man, he says, sexually assaulted him but he felt too vulnerable to report it to the police.

Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty

The once-aspiring singer-songwriter said he continued speaking to the technician and in early December 2013 attended a birthday party in his honor, hosted by Singer. After the party, Singer allegedly invited Skopek and two other young men back to his Los Angeles home where he participated in group sex while taking MDMA, commonly referred to as Molly.

“We’re in the basement, me and the other two kids, we’re kind of chilling. Bryan takes us up, one by one, and gives us all a Molly. He’s splitting it with us. ‘I’ll do half if you do half,’” Skopek said.

Skopek describes a revolving door of sexual partners catering to Singer’s desires. The orgies, he claims, would include up to 10 people.

“Watching the amount of people come in through the night. The sad fact is this is how they think they have to live their lives. This is the only way to make it out there,” said Skopek.

Skopek says that he became disillusioned by Hollywood as Singer took to contacting him for sex at 2 a.m. but never coming through on promises of a cameo appearance in 2016’s X-Men: Apocalypse.

Skopek moved to Fort Worth, Texas, to live with his father in December 2014.

A spokesperson for singer told Deadline Friday: “If Mr. Skopek had a problem with Bryan, he never mentioned it before today. He is someone who has repeatedly asked Bryan for money over the years, and did so as recently as last month. He also is the one who asked Bryan for a role in [ X-Men ] Apocalypse , which Bryan declined to offer to him. The timing of Mr. Skopek coming forward now with these allegations is questionable.”

On Thursday, attorneys for Cesar Sanchez-Guzman filed a lawsuit against Singer for alleged rape on a yacht in 2003. Sanchez-Guzman was 17 at the time.

“Bryan Singer approached Cesar and thrust his body on him,"" the court documents claimed. ""Bryan Singer then forced Cesar to the floor, shoved Cesar’s face against his crotch area and demanded Cesar perform oral sex on him. Bryan Singer pulled out his penis, smacked Cesar in the face with it and forced it into Cesar’s mouth. Cesar pleaded with him to stop, however he continued to force Cesar to perform oral sex, causing Cesar to choke.”

Singer’s spokesperson said the director “categorically denies” the allegations.

On Monday, 20th Century Fox fired Singer as director of Bohemian Rhapsody, a biopic about Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Singer reportedly clashed with lead actor Rami Malek and failed to return to set in London following a break for the Thanksgiving holiday.","xmen apocalypse skopek

However, a New Jersey police officer accidentally captured something quite spectacular on his: a fireball blazing across the sky.

Sgt. Michael Virga was on patrol when the camera recorded the bright meteor, at 3:09 am on December 2, according to a statement on Facebook posted by the Township of Hamilton Police Department.

“It kind of took me by surprise,” Virga told NJ.com. “I just saw a little blip -- it lit up the entire sky like a lime green streak.”

The American Meteor Society (AMS) took to Twitter on December 7 to confirm that what he saw was in fact, a meteor. AMS received reports from 146 people about the fireball event. The society noted it was primarily visible from Pennsylvania, but eyewitness accounts were also reported from twelve other states: New York, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Delaware, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Washington, DC.

Based on the witness reports, AMS estimates the fireball was traveling from the Northeast to Southwest, and ultimately stopped being visible near New Buffalo, PA.

Mike Hankey, AMS Operations Manager, told ABC the meteor was unusually bright.

""I could tell how fast it was going and that it was most likely a cometary fireball because of the speed, and then we traced back the path and it intersected with Gemini, which is the parent radiant of the Geminid meteor shower,"" Hankey said, ABC reports.

The annual Geminid meteor shower is expected to peak overnight on December 13-14. During this time, you’ll be able to see an average of 60 Geminid meteors per hour, according to NASA, who describes the event as “one of the most prolific and reliable meteor showers of the year.”

Over the Geminid meteor shower's 200 years of existence, it’s gotten stronger and brighter, the space agency reports. Unfortunately, a supermoon blocked the meteor shower last year, according to Space.com.

Tom Porter,Trump accused CNN of making a “vicious and intentional mistake” after the network issued a correction for a report.,2017-12-09T16:36:06Z,newsweek,"Gloating Trump renews attack on ""fake news"" after CNN corrects Russia probe story",http://www.newsweek.com/trump-renews-attacks-fake-news-after-cnn-corrects-russia-probe-story-743399,http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/12/09/gettyimages-501552576.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on the ""fake"" news media in a series of tweets early Saturday morning, lashing out at CNN after the network corrected a story on the Trump campaign and Russia.

Trump accused CNN of making a “vicious and intentional mistake” and called on the network to fire those responsible, and also called for ABC reporter Brian Ross, who has been suspended, to be fired for a separate erroneous report.

""Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”),"" Trump wrote. ""Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?""

Trump continued to taunt CNN in a second tweet.

""CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!"" the president tweeted.

The news media has been one of Trump’s most frequent targets since he took office in January. He derides organizations that publish reports critical of him as ""fake news."" In July, he was accused of inciting violence against journalists after he tweeted a gif showing himself body slamming a CNN avatar.

In the corrected CNN report Trump referred to, it was claimed that Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had received a “heads up” email on September 4, ahead of the release by WikiLeaks of a cache of emails stolen from DNC servers, allegedly by Russian government linked hackers.

CNN later corrected its report to state that Trump Jr. had in fact received the email on September 14, subsequent to their public release by WikiLeaks.

The network has said it will not discipline the reporters responsible for the story, because they followed company procedure and used multiple sources to verify the claims, and does not believe they acted with malicious intent.

ABC’s chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross had mistakenly reported on-air that Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that Trump had ordered him to make contact with Russian officials before the 2016 presidential election. The network later corrected the report to state that Trump had made the request as president elect, prior to taking office in January.

Fox News, whose coverage Trump has praised and contrasted with CNN's, also issued a correction for a story Friday in which it was claimed that one of the women who has accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual assault forged his signature in a high school yearbook.

At a rally in support of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore Friday night, Trump had attacked news networks.

“CNN apologized just a little while ago,” Trump said, referring to the error correction. “They apologized. Oh, thank you, CNN. Thank you so much. You should’ve been apologizing for the last two years.”","donald trump jr

Tufayel Ahmed,A Wisconsin judge previously overruled the conviction because Dassey had been coerced into confessing.,2017-12-09T14:24:39Z,newsweek,"A miscarriage of justice?

Dassey’s conviction was overturned by Wisconsin judge William Duffin in August 2016. Duffin ruled that Dassey, who suffers from learning disabilities, was coerced by Manitowoc County police into confessing to the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach.

But a Chicago appeals court voted 4-3 to keep Dassey jailed, ruling his confession voluntary.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

“The state courts’ finding that Dassey’s confession was voluntary was not beyond fair debate, but we conclude it was reasonable,” the seven judges said in a ruling, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Dassey, 27, has been serving life imprisonment since 2007, along with his uncle Steven Avery. Dassey confessed to helping Avery murder Halbach and mutilate her body. However, Judge Duffin overturned the conviction after ruling that investigators in the murder case made promises that ""he would not be punished if he admitted participating in the offenses"" and that ""he had nothing to worry about.""

Dassey and Avery's cases gained worldwide attention in December 2015 when Netflix released the first season of the Emmy-winning Making a Murderer.

Related: More explosive evidence could exonerate Steven Avery and solve Teresa Halbach's murder

One of the judges who voted for Dassey to be freed Friday said the decision to uphold the conviction was a “miscarriage of justice.”

“His confession was not voluntary and his conviction should not stand, and yet an impaired teenager has been sentenced to life in prison. I view this as a profound miscarriage of justice,” Judge Ilana Diamond Rovner wrote in the ruling.

Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department

Chief Judge Diane P. Wood said: “Without this involuntary and highly unreliable confession, the case against Dassey was almost nonexistent.”

Dassey’s uncle, Avery, is currently appealing his own life sentence for raping, killing and mutilating the body of Teresa Halbach, an Auto Trader photographer.

In October, Avery’s appeal attorney Kathleen Zellner filed a motion to reconsider his original conviction, citing new evidence that she believes will exonerate Avery.

Among the new findings that Zellner presented to the court is evidence that Halbach left Avery’s auto salvage yard alive on October 31, 2005. The case against Avery claimed she did not leave the property and was killed by Avery.

Netflix

The new evidence comes from Brendan Dassey’s brother, Bryan, who told the Wisconsin Department of Justice in November 2005 that a third Dassey brother, Bobby, had told him he saw Halbach leave the property alive on October 31.

Related: Steven Avery's nephew looked at images of Teresa Halbach and mutilated dead women, lawyers say

Bobby Dassey later testified that he last saw Halbach walking toward Avery’s trailer, which was reportedly the last time she was seen alive.

Zellner, in various court documents, has also implicated Bobby Dassey as the real culprit of Halbach’s murder.

Forensic testing of the Dasseys’ home computer found “images of Ms. Halbach, many images of violent pornography involving young females being raped and tortured, and images of injuries to females, including a decapitated head, bloodied torso, a bloody head injury and a mutilated body.” The analysis was isolated to times when only Bobby Dassey had access to the computer.","manitowoc county sheriffs department

If there was any single event that would cause the Republican elite to openly revolt against the ongoing Trumpification of their party, it would be the nomination of Roy Moore for U.S. Senate in Alabama. Even prior to the allegations of child molestation, Moore had discovered innovative new realms of extremism that had never occurred to even his most ideologically fervent colleagues. He proposed banning Muslims from serving in elected office, called for the criminalization of homosexuality, and defied court rulings and declared his own biblical jurisprudence the sole valid legal authority.

And if that revolt was going to begin anywhere, it would likely be in Utah. The state’s Mormon culture recoiled from Donald Trump’s libidinous boasting, erratic behavior, and displays of extravagant consumption.

Between the 2012 and 2016 elections, Utah’s Republican presidential margin underwent an astonishing 28 percent collapse.

Orrin Hatch, who has represented Utah in the Senate since 1977, greeted Moore’s candidacy in this year’s election with skepticism. (“I have trouble with” Moore’s comments on gays and Muslims, he said in October.) Once evidence surfaced of Moore’s alleged predation of teenage girls, Hatch pulled the rip cord. “If the deeply disturbing allegations in the Washington Post are true, Senator Hatch believes that Judge Moore should step aside immediately,” his spokesman declared.

But even in Utah, there were forces at work to make Hatch reconsider. He was facing a potential primary challenge from a Trumpian candidate who had met with party insurrectionist Steve Bannon and Citizens United president David Bossie. In November, Hatch lavished praise on the president, calling him “one of the best I’ve served under.” Trump rewarded Hatch by endorsing him. Hatch then defended Trump’s endorsement of Moore, arguing that he “needs every Republican he can get so he can put his agenda through.”

Hatch’s response to Moore has followed that of his entire party, and the backtracking has usefully laid bare its power dynamics. As recently as a few weeks ago, Republicans were debating whether to shun Moore or, should he win, vote to expel him from the Senate. They have settled on a course of action that had initially been off the map altogether: endorsing their lecherous ayatollah and providing financial support from the Republican National Committee.

What mattered most was that Donald Trump has contempt for any standards of conduct. (Indeed, he reportedly has taken offense at the accusations against Moore, which remind him of his own treatment.) And no Republican who wishes to stay in office can afford to offend the president, who commands overwhelming support among the party base.

This was the dynamic last year, when a tape revealed Trump casually confessing to sexual assault, and it was briefly impossible to imagine that he could continue the campaign. Reince Priebus urged him to quit; Mike Pence reportedly offered his services to the RNC as a substitute. Then the incomprehensible became inevitable. The same thing happened in May when a Republican House candidate, Greg Gianforte, assaulted a reporter and then lied about it.

Would Republicans denounce him? Expel him? It turned out they would do nothing. By the time Moore came along, the party’s moral sensibilities had been worn to a nub.

The next step in the sequence is almost insultingly obvious. Trump is preparing to shut down Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian intervention in the 2016 election.

The administration and its allied media organs, especially those owned by Rupert Murdoch, have spent months floating a series of rationales, of varying degrees of implausibility, for why a deeply respected Republican law-enforcement veteran is disqualified to lead the inquiry: He is friends with James Comey, who is biased because Trump fired him; Comey is biased because he pursued leads turned up in Christopher Steele’s investigation, which was financed by Democrats; Mueller has failed to investigate Hillary Clinton’s marginal-to-nonexistent role in a uranium sale.

The newest pseudo-scandal fixates on the role of Peter Strzok, an FBI official who helped tweak the language Comey employed in his statement condemning Clinton’s email carelessness and has also worked for Mueller.

His alleged crime is a series of text messages criticizing Trump. Mueller removed Strzok from his team, but that is not enough for Trump’s supporters, who are seizing on Strzok’s role as a pretext to discredit and remove Mueller, too. The notion that a law-enforcement official should be disqualified for privately expressing partisan views is a novel one, and certainly did not trouble Republicans last year, when Rudy Giuliani was boasting on television about his network of friendly agents. Yet in the conservative media, Mueller and Comey have assumed fiendish personae of almost Clintonian proportions.

When Mueller was appointed, legal scholars debated whether Trump had the technical authority to fire him, but even the majority who believed he did assumed such a power existed only in theory. Republicans in Congress, everyone believed, would never sit still for such a blatant cover-up.

Josh Blackman, a conservative lawyer, argued that Trump could remove the special counsel, but “make no mistake: Mueller’s firing would likely accelerate the end of the Trump administration.” Texas representative Mike McCaul declared in July, “If he fired Bob Mueller, I think you’d see a tremendous backlash, response from both Democrats but also House Republicans.” Such a rash move “could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency,” Senator Lindsey Graham proclaimed.

In August, members of both parties began drawing up legislation to prevent Trump from sacking Mueller. “The Mueller situation really gave rise to our thinking about how we can address the current situation,” explained Republican senator Thom Tillis, a sponsor of one of the bills. By early autumn, the momentum behind the effort had slowed; by Thanksgiving, Republican interest had melted away. “I don’t see any heightened kind of urgency, if you’re talking about some of the reports around Flynn and others,” Tillis said recently. “I don’t see any great risk.”

In fact, the risk has swelled. Trump has publicly declared any investigation into his finances would constitute a red line, and that he reserves the option to fire Mueller if he investigates them. Earlier this month, it was reported that Mueller has subpoenaed records at Deutsche Bank, an institution favored both by Trump and the Russian spy network.

John Dowd, a lawyer for Trump, recently floated the wildly expansive defense that a “president cannot obstruct justice, because he is the chief law-enforcement officer.” Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett called the investigation “illegitimate and corrupt” and declared that “the FBI has become America’s secret police.” Graham is now calling for a special counsel to investigate “Clinton email scandal, Uranium One, role of Fusion GPS, and FBI and DOJ bias during 2016 campaign” — i.e., every anti-Mueller conspiracy theory. And perhaps as ominously, Trump’s allies have been surfacing fallback defenses. Yes, “some conspiratorial quid pro quo between somebody in the Trump campaign and somebody representing Vladimir Putin” is “possible,” allowed Wall Street Journal columnist Holman Jenkins, but “we would be stupid not to understand that other countries have a stake in the outcome of our elections and, by omission or commission, try to advance their interests. This is reality.” The notion of a criminal conspiracy by a hostile nation to intervene in the election in return for pliant foreign policy has gone from unthinkable to blasé, an offense only to naïve bourgeois morality.

It is almost a maxim of the Trump era that the bounds of the unthinkable continuously shrink. The capitulation to Moore was a dry run for the coming assault on the rule of law.

Madison Malone Kircher@4evrmalone,Not everyone realized you needed to buy tickets in advance to get in … which made for a lot of crying kids.,2017-12-09T20:22:53.9Z,new-york-magazine,Among the Paulers: Scenes from Day One of Jake Paul’s New York City Pop-Up,http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/12/jake-paul-hosts-pop-up-shop-in-new-york-city.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/selectall/2017/12/08/jake-paul/jake-paul-pop-up-11.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Photo: Victor Llorente

“Are you filming me?” I asked ten-year-old Daniel, whose front-facing iPhone camera was clearly trained on my face. “Yeah, of course,” he said. “I’m vlogging.”

Daniel, his dad, and three friends had been standing on a curb on West 37th street in 30-degree weather for several hours waiting to get into a pop up store hosted by internet star Jake Paul and his social media incubator, Team 10. Daniel and his pals were among the lucky ones; they had been able to purchase tickets guaranteeing their entry to the store when it opened on Friday afternoon. Not everyone waiting on the street could say the same. After last minute changes to the location and time of the event, Paul announced late Thursday via Instagram Stories that if you wanted to get in on Friday, you’d have to buy a $10 ticket. Quantities were limited, sold out quickly, and, as a friendly security guard kept shouting into the growing crowd, “NO TICKET! NO ENTRY!” More than a few tears would be shed over Paul before the store closed for the day by fans who couldn’t get inside.

Photo: Victor Llorente

“I like that he [Paul] has a Lamborghini,” Daniel’s friend Sophia, also 10, said. “I like that he names his cars,” seven-year-old Mia added. Each of the four kids was already decked out in Jake Paul gear, included Team 10 hooded sweatshirts and Paul’s signature yellow-tinted aviator sunglasses AKA Yellars. I was quickly informed my pronunciation of “Yellars” was wrong; Daniel mentioned something about really needing to lean into the final “r” sound. All four said they are aspiring YouTubers inspired by Paul. Sophia – “I play hockey so I do videos about that” – had the most followers of the group … 30. “I bet I could sell these tickets and make some real money right now,” Daniel’s father told the kids. “You absolutely will not,” Daniel told him. “I have to get inside.”

Photo: Victor Llorente

“Somebody was selling a ticket for $200,” 11-year-old Isabella said. “Even though they’re only $10.” A spokesperson for Paul said the funds raised via Friday’s ticket sales are going to charity. (Fans were also asked to bring a gift for a toy drive sponsored by the NYPD.) Shop hours on Saturday and Sunday will not be ticketed and people will be let in on a first come, first serve basis. (Team 10’s pop up store in Los Angeles earlier this December was relocated and ultimately shut down after crowds got out of control.) Of course, this is little consolation to anybody from out of town who lined up on Friday only to be turned away. “Do you think I should try to bribe the security guard,” one mother asked. “Do you think that would work?” It didn’t.

Photo: Victor Llorente

Daniel and his group hailed from New York, but Jake Paulers – Paul’s fandom’s preferred name – from all around the country gathered outside the shop on Friday. Some arrived as early as 9AM on Friday, standing outside completely unaware they needed to pay in advance – by that point the day’s 2,000 tickets were already sold out – to get inside. Many skipped school to come to the event. “She’s missing a science test for this,” one mother said, pointing at her 12-year-old daughter. “Anything for Jake Paul,” the daughter replied. The rest of the crowd was a mixed bag of “we’re playing hooky,” “we had the afternoon off for Superintendent’s day,” and, for the Catholic school contingent, “today is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception so no class.”

Photo: Victor Llorente

A family of four from Indiana said they made the trek to Manhattan just to see Paul. An aunt treating her two nieces from Texas to a Christmastime trip to the city told me they’d reorganized all their weekend plans around Paul. Fans from Florida. Fans from Illinois. From Pennsylvania, Connecticut, California, and New Jersey. Team 10 has been very clear that there is no guarantee a visit to the shop means you’ll see Paul or any other member of his squad, meaning these kids – and the adults who brought them – flocked to West 37th Street mostly to drop some cash on Paul merchandise with only the hope of catching a glimpse of Paul. “I brought $200 with me that I’m going to spend today,” one kid said. Another fan proffered up a $100 bill. Friday’s hot ticket item, according to the crowd, was Paul’s “cotton candy hoodie” for about $60. It is entirely sold out online.

Photo: Victor Llorente

I had to stop asking fans how frequently they watch Jake Paul’s content. There’s only so many times you can have a gaggle of preteens yell “it’s everyday, bro” at you before you start to understand just how literally these kids take Paul’s catchphrase. They get alerts any time Paul posts something new and they watch it immediately and repeatedly. I also lost count of the number of times I heard “It’s Everyday Bro,” Paul’s song which charted at spot number 94 on the Hot 100 list last May. Alex, a 12-year-old with diamond studs in both ears, blasted the song from a blue, wireless speaker he’d brought with him. Holding it above his head like a truly terrible 2017 remake of Say Anything, he was quickly joined by several other kids who also knew every single word. Later a young woman named Paris would perform it for me a cappella when asked how big of a Jake Pauler she considered herself. Her mother chimed in with a few lyrics during the chorus.

Photo: Victor Llorente

Paul’s young fans think their Lambo-driving, prank-pulling hero can do no wrong. Kids told me the Martinez twins, a set of Spanish brothers who recently pulled out of Team 10 after alleging they’d been bullied by Paul, had nothing to complain about. “Jake wasn’t actually mean to them.” “They were just using Jake.” “He treated them like brothers.” Paul has since apologized to the Martinez twins. More than a half dozen kids told me they were “inspired” by Paul’s relief trip to Texas following Hurricane Harvey. (During the trip, Paul was mobbed by fans in the parking lot of a San Antonio Wal-Mart and emergency services and the fire department had to be called to control the scene.)

“He never gives up. He has a big spirit and no matter if people hate on him he fights back,” Alex, the kid with the speaker, told me. They were likewise unfazed by stunts, like lighting a large fire in his empty swimming pool, which prompted Paul’s neighbors to complain to the city until the influencer moved out. “He’s Jake Paul … he can do that stuff.” “He’s just a savage,” another fan said. “He’s savage!” I asked what “savage” meant to them. “It means you’re cool.” “More than cool.” “You’re like crazy and lit all the time.”

About half an hour before the shop opened, Paul emerged to greet the crowd. Even if you couldn’t see him stepping outside the sound would have clued you in instantly. Screaming. Cheering. Chanting. Audible crying. A wall of phones and tablets were suddenly raised skyward for pictures and videos. Paul took selfies and signed everything fans shoved at him before getting into an SUV and driving away. The whole thing couldn’t have lasted more than 20 minutes. If you were close enough to grab a picture, you might have noticed Paul has the number “10” shaved into the back of his head. It was for a vlog, New York teens Marissa and Olivia explained. He also shaved “LIB” – short for the ubiquitous internet phrase “Link In Bio” – into another member of Team 10’s head, the girls said. “It was a prank.” Marisa and Olivia said they were hopeful Paul might make a reappearance, “maybe like in a different outfit,” before the store closed Friday night.

Photo: Victor Llorente

The girls were in luck. Paul came back later in the evening, along with some other members of Team 10. (A spokesperson for Paul said they’ll be staggering meet and greets on a rotating schedule all weekend to keep things from getting “too crazy.”) But if you had tickets for a time slot between Paul’s visits or didn’t stick around on the blind faith that Paul would return, there’s a good chance you missed him entirely. And while many of the kids present were content with a selfie or a Sharpie scribble on their shirt, their parents and chaperones were generally less thrilled. “Are you going to talk to Jake,” one father asked. “Tell him Maggie’s dad thinks he’s a weasel [for not staying the whole time].”

Another dad proclaimed Paul both “an idiot” and a “marketing genius.” “My son, Max, is Jake’s number one fan and I think it’s really messed up that last minute they’re doing this ticket thing and I think that’s wrong,” another mother, who wasn’t able to get into the pop up with her son, complained. Max wants to be a YouTuber and, taking off a Jake Paul mask so I could actually hear him, said his parents are getting him camera with a microphone so he can start filming videos. Max is nine.

Photo: Victor Llorente

While maybe not so much as their diss track-chanting kids, these parents are Jake Paulers in their own right, mostly because many of them pre-watch Paul’s content, or watch it with their kids, to make sure it’s appropriate. “My mom has to watch the things we watch before we’re allowed to so she has to watch Jake Paul too,” Isabella said. “My son is crazy about Jake Paul. Paul is honestly one of the only YouTubers my son watched that I can actually stand,” Rhiannon, a mother waiting with her son, told me. “The cursing is a little over the top, but honestly it’s nothing probably more than my son hears from me.”

Photo: Victor Llorente

Rhiannon said she’d already spent “easily $500” on Paul merchandise for her son. “Every time something new comes out he gets it.” Other parents echoed similar, if not higher, tallies. “At least $1,000 between both my daughters,” said one mother. “I dropped at least $750 on merch,” another said. “Everything they are getting for Christmas is Jake Paul.” A third quoted a $1,500 figure. A quantitative reminder that for all the charms effused by the 20-year-old blonde from Los Angeles, this is very much a business for Paul. And a lucrative one at that. A spokesperson declined to answer how much business Paul and Team 10 were expecting to do during the shop’s three day run, but noted the merchandise is entirely exclusive to the NY pop up and that there are over a dozen points of sale within the store.

“Please let me give you my money,” one mother yelled from the corral for people who decided to stick around despite being told they wouldn’t be allowed to shop without tickets. “Please.”","vlog new york teens marissa and olivia

Matthew Love,The Disaster Artist star really commits to his fourth SNL hosting gig.,2017-12-10T15:46:21.555Z,new-york-magazine,Saturday Night Live Recap: James Franco (Almost) Makes Leslie Jones Puke,http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/snl-recap-season-43-james-franco.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/12/08/recaps/08-snl-franco.w1200.h630.JPG,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Photo: Kailey Fellows/NBC

This marks James Franco’s fourth time hosting, which means he’s both a familiar and reliable presence at SNL. Since his first turn in 2008, the sunny, squinting heartthrob with the perma-stoned glaze has played everything from a bridge troll to James Dean. More than willing to indulge the writers’ whims (and chew a little scenery while he’s at it), Franco has played a part in many recurring sketches, including one with the overly affectionate Vogelcheck family and one of Bill Hader’s Vincent Price specials. Although he’s yet to create a character that transcends the bounds of a sketch, he’s game for seemingly anything. And, as he’s just released The Disaster Artist — a film about The Room, “the Citizen Kane of bad films” — the timing is certainly good for Franco to deliver a memorable comic performance.

Visit With Santa Cold Open

It’s a Christmas like any other, but as kids line up to sit on Santa’s lap, they have a few concerns: What did Al Franken do? Is President Trump on the naughty list? Which list is Roy Moore on? For his part, Santa (Kenan Thompson) would rather sidestep the politics and talk toys instead. “A toy like the one Matt Lauer gave to his co-worker?” one of the kids wants to know. Seems the children have grown up too fast, and at least one of them wants to know everything will be okay. Santa’s helper Amy (Kate McKinnon) reassures young, worried Jenny that eventually, good people will fix our country. Though this sketch gets sidetracked by a few kids who can’t quite get their lines out, the unexpected framework and innocent perspectives definitely work in its favor.

James Franco Monologue

According to Franco, during your fourth time hosting, SNL writers just “throw you [onstage] and make you take questions from the audience.” As he fields queries like, “Do you see an arc to your career?” and “What time is it?” Seth Rogen tries to remain inconspicuous in the second row. Turns out Rogen refused Franco’s earlier offer to do a sketch on the show, and only showed up to see musical guest SZA. Jonah Hill takes his seat next to Rogen, not even sure who’s hosting. Up in the balcony, Steve Martin is resentful because he’s no longer a hot property. As a few minutes of cameos, it’s fine; as an attempt to take the piss out of Franco, there’s nothing sharp or surprising about it.

Sexual-Harassment Charlie

As Betacorp evaluates complaints about sexual harassment in its workplace, the higher-ups have decided to fire CFO Doug (Franco) and the aging front-door guy, Charlie (Kenan Thompson). While Doug and Charlie apologize to their officemates, the ladies are far more lenient toward the chipper, graying old man who tells women, “Don’t hurt nobody with that thing,” than they are with the younger guy who tells them why they should smile more. Charlie’s confessions devolve into fantasies about kidnapping and tying up husbands so he can have sex with their wives — but it’s all still just “classic Charlie.” Truth be told, Charlie is not being fired for his mouth but the fact he’s been stealing money, cocaine possession, and a half-dozen other things. It’s a clever examination of where collective affection can trump righteousness, and Kenan Thompson is a freakin’ delight.

Gift Wrap

It’s Christmas time at Bloomingdale’s, and Don (Franco), a very excited member of the gift-wrapping department, just can’t get enough of the season. Even though he gives himself a paper cut and starts spraying blood everywhere, he won’t step back and let his co-worker (McKinnon) wrap the gifts. Things get much worse: He spits blood in a customer’s face, then cuts off a few fingers and part of his leg in the name of holiday spirit. Really, though, this sketch is about whether Leslie Jones will throw up. She’s the customer who gets a faceful (and mouthful) of stage blood, and she can’t stop gagging long enough to get her lines out. The mix of glee and dread on her fellow performers’ faces — namely Thompson and McKinnon — lets the audience know how dire things onstage have become. Not for the faint of heart, but recommended for the beautiful disaster and Franco’s ongoing commitment to the bit.

Scrudge

Though he’s a little hesitant to do so, a guy (Mooney) invites his roommate Scrudge (Beck) to a friend’s Christmas party. The guy’s hesitance is not unfounded, because once at the party, Scrudge is a complete dick: He insults everyone, swills their liquor, and bums their last cigarettes. Once on the roof, Scrudge bumps into an angel in disguise (Franco), who suggests Scrudge look down through the skylight because he “might not be as cool” as he thinks. Scrudge overhears his friends talking about how terrible he is and decides to mend his ways … sorta. The premise isn’t bad — a modern-day Scrooge who is somewhere between an asshat and a douchebag — but Scrudge’s bad behaviors don’t feel playful enough to transcend their nastiness.

Spelling Bee

In the second round of the Iowa City All-District Spelling Bee, moderator Kevin Black (Franco) keeps bringing up words that have very curious definitions and context sentences. The hint for “berate,” involves someone being emasculated by a stepfather’s “feminine nicknames,” and “chagrin” is defined as the feeling one might have after your stepfather tells the entire lacrosse team that you haven’t grown pubes. Black reveals more and more about himself until the word is “Little Pig Boy,” and he’s telling David (Pete Davidson) about being a “pathetic dirty bitch baby that mistress gets to stand on.” This wonderfully sick sketch builds incredibly well, and some well-crafted lines even get Franco giggling.

Weekend Update

There really is no such thing as a slow-news week in our current climate. This round, Update examines everything from Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel to the L.A. wildfires. Highlights include this week’s three resignations in Congress (“You know what that means: Time to open three more doors on our sexual-harassment-themed advent calendar”) and Trump’s endorsement of Alabama’s creepy Senate candidate Roy Moore. On Trump’s use of the phrase, “Go get ’em, Roy,” Colin Jost says, “‘Go get ’em, Roy,’ is what Roy Moore whispers to himself right before he walks into a Hot Topic.” Cecily Strong comes on as Cathy Anne, the twitchy former drug addict with a penchant for malaprops. She talks about the nation’s changing relationship to sexual assault and harassment allegations, including Al Franken’s resignation and why Democratss taking the moral high ground doesn’t mean a thing (“As if everyone in Alabama was on their edge of their seat, wondering what Kristen Jellybeans was going to do about Al Franco”). For someone who is “a political junkie and a regular junkie,” she makes some cogent points.

The second half includes just a few jokes before Michael Che plays a short film about his quest to understand liberal, white women … by becoming a liberal white woman named Gretchen. Che goes undercover, wearing a blonde wig but no makeup, and saying things at dinner parties like, “Your masculinity is mad toxic, my nigga.” This is a jab at the kinds of well-off people who feel they need to speak up for others of different ethnic or cultural backgrounds, and while it’s a little snotty, it’s a fair examination of self-righteous behavior.

Za

At the trial of one Mr. Reynolds (Pete Davidson), the prosecutor (Franco) can’t quite get over one detail in the defendant’s alibi: The fact that Reynolds was supposedly at a pizza shop eating ’za. The prosecutor is convinced that nicknames should be based on how things sound, not on the way they’re spelled; therefore, “zah” should refer to lasagna, while “zuh” should be short for pizza. So adamant is the prosecutor that he flies into a frenzy of zahs and zuh,” showing off visual aids to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his idea is correct. After a pizza-delivery guy walks in with a “zuh” for the defendant, it’s all very clear. The prosecutor doesn’t even need to use a photo of Reynolds at the scene of the crime. This isn’t just a one-joke sketch, but a one-syllable sketch. In any case, Franco sells the silliness well.

Christmas Charity

In this filmed sketch, a high-powered professional (Cecily Strong) buys a shivering homeless man (Franco) a coffee and a Danish in the spirit of Christmas. Feeling generous, she then sweeps the man into Rothman’s for a new wardrobe, eats hot dogs with him on a pedicab ride, and takes him to her place where she scans wanted ads in search of his future employer. It’s only when she approaches him with a razor to shave his beard does the truth come out: He’s actually James Franco, researching a part. He stayed quiet because he’s used to people buying him things. It’s cute and charming enough, but the “it was all a dream!” reveal is disappointing after the long walk.

Reunion

On the porch of his mom’s place, while the big family reunion is going on inside, James Franco bumps into his cousin, “pretty Mandy” (Heidi Gardner). She wants to know everything: Whether he still goes swimming, whether he still eats candy, and whether or not he might need help. Sure, he’s a Hollywood star but does he remember when he “used to make good movies”? Mandy is doing pretty great herself: She got a bull’s eye playing darts back in October, and the bar even named a drink after her. (Okay, it was just gin with a straw in it, but still.) Eventually, Franco’s brother, Dave, emerges and gets star-struck by Mandy. The switcheroo is fun, but the most enjoyable aspect is Gardner’s self-assured oddball — a nasal, fanny-pack-and-fingerless-glove-wearing lady in the Lebowski mold.

Once again, James Franco proves himself an adept SNL host. If anything, sketches like “Gift Wrap” and “Za,” prove his commitment to bits has only improved. Of course, not everything hits home, but the show makes room for a lot of different sketches: character pieces, gross-out gags, writerly obsessions, and literary spoofs. Given that the straightforward political opens haven’t succeeded this season, the writers are wise to try out another, unlikely sketch structure. That paid off, too. Next week, Kevin Hart will undoubtedly mug his way through the last show of the year.","fannypackandfingerlessglovewearing

Benjamin Hart@realaxelfoley,"In a chronicle of the president’s average day, Trump’s unfitness for office is evident in his obsessions with cable news.",2017-12-09T21:07:34.148Z,new-york-magazine,The 5 Most Disturbing New York Times Revelations About Trump’s TV Habits,http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/the-most-disturbing-times-revelations-about-trumps-tv-habit.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/09/09-trump-on-tv.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Photo: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images

A New York Times piece published Saturday delivers a blow-by-blow guide to President Trump’s strange and unnerving daily routine. “For Mr. Trump, every day is an hour-by-hour battle for self-preservation,” the Times writes. It is a battle fueled by resentment, Diet Coke (Trump apparently drinks 12 per day), and, above all, an ungodly amount of television news.

A lot has been written about the 45th president’s addiction to TV, which, like most everything about Trump, stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, who famously shunned the 24-hour news cycle. But the Times paints the clearest picture yet of how, exactly, he consumes the poisonous miasma of cable news, and the details are predictably jarring. Here are the five most worrying:

1) Trump watches four-to-eight hours of television a day.

True, this puts him squarely in the category of average, screen-addicted American — screen time, plus his remarkably high-cholesterol diet, may be the most populist thing about him. But most of us aren’t juggling the demands of being what was once known as “the leader of the free world.” Then again, a constantly distracted Trump may be preferable to the alternative.

2) Trump’s mood can rise and fall based on morning shows.

It has long been clear that Fox and Friends, the headquarters for inane pro-Trump babble, is a primary driver of Trump’s tweets. (The Times reports that “aides monitor ‘Fox & Friends’ live or through a transcription service in much the way commodities traders might keep tabs on market futures to predict the direction of their day.”) But sometimes, Trump starts his day off with CNN or MSNBC, saving Fox’s daily Trump affirmations for later, via his presidential “super TiVo.” If he doesn’t wake up with a healthy dose of Fox propaganda, Trump is “likely to be in a foul mood,” which, in our delightful reality, makes the odds of nuclear armageddon tick upward by about 0.8 percent.

3) Trump only likes news about Trump.

One former top adviser said Mr. Trump grew uncomfortable after two or three days of peace and could not handle watching the news without seeing himself on it,” the Times reports. It’s news to nobody that for Trump, attention is the be-all and end-all of human existence; the worst fate isn’t unpopularity or rejection, but irrelevance. The presidency likes the news because he is the news.

4) Trump sees his presidency as a TV show.

“Before taking office,” the article reports, “Mr. Trump told top aides to think of each presidential day as an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.” This is in keeping with Trump’s vision of life as an eternal revenge plot against those who have deigned to underestimate him. Part of what makes Trump so dangerous is his insistence on creating a foe at every turn to sustain that narrative.

5) Trump is president of the United States.

Okay, this one’s not exactly new. But it should never stop being a shock that the leader of the country is an addled couch potato whose addiction to his own image supersedes any intellectual curiosity or empathy.","behrouz mehriafpgetty

If someone had asked me back in the day, if, in 2017, we’d be having a discussion about whether a fundamentalist baker should be forced by the law to create a wedding cake for a gay couple, I’d have been gobsmacked, as the Brits say. Smacked in the gob because only a decade ago such a question would have seemed so remotely hypothetical as to be absurd. And yet, here we are. A Christian baker has taken a stand on the grounds of religious conscience and artistic freedom not to provide a cake specifically designed for a legal, constitutional same-sex wedding. His case was just argued in the Supreme Court no less. The staggering victories of the marriage-equality movement (now, Australia!) have led us here — far sooner than most of us pioneers ever contemplated. And the speed and finality of this social change has — understandably — frightened, disturbed, and alienated many on the other side. They are still smarting from the sting of defeat, defensibly regrouping and obsessing over their victimhood.

Which is why I think it was a prudential mistake to sue the baker. Live and let live would have been a far better response. The baker’s religious convictions are not trivial or obviously in bad faith, which means to say he is not just suddenly citing them solely when it comes to catering to gays. His fundamentalism makes him refuse to make even Halloween cakes, for Pete’s sake. More to the point, he has said he would provide any form of custom-designed cakes for gay couples — a birthday cake, for example — except for one designed for a specific celebration that he has religious objections to. And those religious convictions cannot be dismissed as arbitrary (even if you find them absurd). Opposition to same-sex marriage has been an uncontested pillar of every major world religion for aeons.

And so, if there are alternative solutions, like finding another baker, why force the point? Why take up arms to coerce someone when you can easily let him be — and still celebrate your wedding? That is particularly the case when much of the argument for marriage equality was that it would not force anyone outside that marriage to approve or disapprove of it. One reason we won that debate is because many straight people simply said to themselves, “How does someone else’s marriage affect me?” and decided on those grounds to support or acquiesce to such a deep social change. It seems grotesquely disingenuous now for the marriage-equality movement to bait and switch on that core “live and let live” argument. And it seems deeply insensitive and intolerant to force the clear losers in a culture war into not just defeat but personal humiliation.

Nonetheless, here we are. And it is a hard case constitutionally. It pits religious and artistic freedom against civil equality and nondiscrimination. Anyone on either side who claims this is an easy call are fanatics of one kind or other. I’m deeply conflicted. I worry that a decision that endorses religious freedom could effectively nullify a large swathe of antidiscrimination legislation — and have a feeling that Scalia, for example, would have backed the gays in this case on those grounds alone. Equally, I worry that a ruling that backs the right of the state to coerce someone into doing something that violates their religious conscience will also have terrible consequences. A law that controls an individual’s conscience violates a core liberal idea. It smacks of authoritarianism and of a contempt for religious faith. It feels downright anti-American to me.

The smartest and most nuanced take I’ve read on the subject is that of philosopher John Corvino. He argues that there is indeed a core right not to be forced to create something against your conscience but that in this particular case, the act of creation is so deeply entwined with hostility to an entire class of people that antidiscrimination laws overrule it. It’s worth reading, but he still doesn’t quite convince me. The baker is clearly not discriminating against an entire class of people; he is refusing to endorse a particular activity that violates his faith. Kennedy was absolutely right in oral arguments to make a distinction between an identity and an activity. The conflation of the two is just too facile.

And there’s a way out of this that need not take such a strong stand in terms of religious freedom. It seems to me the baker deserves to be able to pick and choose what kind of work he wants to do as an artist. A commenter on Rod Dreher’s blog proffers a series of important questions in this respect:

“If the cake shop loses, does that mean that if I’m, say, a freelance designer or an artist or a writer or a photographer, I can no longer pick and choose my clients? If the Westboro Baptist Church comes to me, I can’t reject them on the grounds that they’re deeply un-Christian scumbags? If I’m Jewish, do I have to design a Hitler’s Birthday cake with swastikas on it? Would a Muslim cake-shop owner be forced to design a cake that shows an Islamic terrorist with crosshairs over his face, a common target design in most gun shops in America? Can a gay, atheist web designer choose not to do work for the Catholic Church, or would we have the government compel him to take on a client he loathes?”

It always worries me when gays advocate taking freedom away from other people. It worries me as a matter of principle. But it also unsettles me because some gay activists do not seem to realize that the position they’re taking is particularly dangerous for a tiny and historically despised minority. The blithe unconcern for the First Amendment in the war on “hate speech,” for example, ignores the fact that, for centuries, the First Amendment was the only defense the gay minority ever had — and now, with the first taste of power, we are restricting the rights of others in this respect? Ugh. Endorse the state’s right to coerce speech or conscience and you have ceded a principle that can so easily come back to haunt you. The freedom of any baker to express himself is, in this respect, indistinguishable from that of any gay person to do so — a truth that our current tribalism blinds so many to. I hope, in other words, that the baker prevails — but that the Supreme Court decision doesn’t turn on religious so much as artistic freedom.

One final thought as a Christian. Sealing yourself off from those you consider sinners is, in my reading of the Gospels, the reverse of what Jesus taught. It was precisely this tendency of the religious to place themselves above others, to create clear boundaries to avoid “contamination” from “evildoers” that Jesus uniquely violated and profoundly opposed. If Jesus is your guide, why is this kind of boundary observance such an important part of your faith? Are you afraid your own faith will be weakened by decorating a cake? Would you have ever had dinner with prostitutes or imperial tax collectors as Jesus famously did? What is this Christianity you are so dedicated to? Somewhere, the fundamental Christian imperative to love others and be humble before them has been lost.

In other words, if the liberals were more liberal, and the Christians more Christian, this case would never have existed. It tells you a great deal about the decadence of our culture that it does.

The Jerusalem Folly

I have to say I roll my eyes at the various attempts to explain President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state, and to make plans to move the U.S. embassy there. Is it an attempt to shake up the region to make peace more possible — or merely a strategic concession to reality? Why would Trump give the Israelis such a gift while asking nothing in return? Tom Friedman ponderously asks. And how on earth does it help the U.S. in navigating the entire region, since it guts any American pretense at even the appearance of neutrality? The earnest questions are everywhere.

And they are ridiculous. The reason for this move is self-evident. The Trump administration believes in the project of Greater Israel, and the right of just one people to control all the territory from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean. They believe this as a theological and moral imperative, and all other diplomatic considerations take second place. Who are the key figures who hold this belief? Jared Kushner, the dauphin who has dedicated his short adult life to obliterating any concept of a Palestinian state; the U.S. ambassador David Friedman, whose commitment to Jewish supremacy in Greater Israel has always been total; and Mike Pence, whose theological conviction is that Israel must be made whole and eternal (and the Palestinians wished away) if the Second Coming is to arrive. Sometimes, Occam’s razor really helps. There is no need to wonder why this has happened. It has happened because this is now U.S. policy: the extirpation of the Palestinian cause and the complete conflation of America’s national interest with Greater Israel’s in the region. This is what Sheldon Adelson paid for and what Ralph Reed demands. And this is what they will get.

Take the absurdity of Kushner as an envoy to both sides. Appointing him to oversee an Israel-Palestine two-state solution is like appointing David Duke to resolve America’s racial tensions:

“According to tax records, the Charles and Seryl Kushner Foundation donated at least $38,000 between 2011 and 2013 to the American Friends of Beit El Yeshiva, the fundraising arm of a Jewish seminary in Beit El, a West Bank settlement. The Beit El Yeshiva Center is associated with Arutz Sheva, also known as Israel National News, a news organization affiliated with the Jewish settler movement […] In 2012 and 2013, the Kushner family foundation donated a total of $15,000 to the Etzion Foundation, which operates three Orthodox Jewish study institutions in West Bank settlements. In 2011, the family donated $5,000 to Ohr Torah Stone, an Orthodox Jewish educational institution in the West Bank settlement of Efrat.”

For much of that time, Jared Kushner was a co-director of the foundation, a role — surprise! — he failed to disclose before his appointment. Kushner, moreover, has continued to fund West Bank settlements even after assuming his current role, as ProPublica reported on Wednesday: “The charitable fund made a donation of at least $18,000 at the ‘Master Builders’ level to American Friends of Beit El Yeshiva Center, according to a donor book distributed at the group’s annual gala Sunday evening.” That Manhattan gala was attended by John Bolton (scheduled for a meeting with Trump today in the White House), and featured a promotional video about the radical settlement. Set to action-movie music, the short film “showed high-school-age youth training in the settlement’s military academy. ‘Beit El is very important because it establishes our claim that God gave us this land,’ said Karen Frager, an activist who spoke on a video shown on stage.”

And who, for years, was the head of this charity? I give you David Friedman, who is now U.S. ambassador! I mean seriously. What more do you need to know?

The policy is complemented by a cynical alliance with fundamentalist or authoritarian Sunni states, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, against Iran and Shiite Islam … because targeting Iran is Israel’s primary foreign-policy objective (along with ending the nuclear deal) and getting these regimes to abandon any support for the Palestinians is critical to the legitimization of Greater Israel. Hence the “peace” plan Kushner has discussed with his fellow plutocratic scion, the Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman: “a Palestinian state with only ‘moral sovereignty’ and noncontiguous territory and without East Jerusalem as the capital; no Israeli settlement evacuation; and no right of return for Palestinian refugees.” That is: a few apartheid-style Bantustans for the Palestinians; the designation of Abu Dis, a Jerusalem suburb already cut off by Israel’s wall, as their metaphorical “capital”; and an end to any reasonable two-state solution at all.

And this, of course, has been the de facto U.S. policy for quite a while, because it has been AIPAC’s top policy goal for ages. To see how entrenched this is, it’s important to remember that a two-term president, Barack Obama, was unable even to get a temporary pause in the pace of the intensifying annexation of the West Bank; and that Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer wanted Trump to go even further and use the word “undivided” to describe Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. When Trump says this decision is merely about recognition of reality, he is, in other words, half-right. But it is not a recognition of the reality of the Middle East; it’s a recognition of the reality of American domestic politics, and the unique place that Israel has in it.

Harassment Double Standards

There is an argument going around that the partisan polarization on the question of sexual harassment, abuse, and assault will come back to haunt the GOP at the polls next year. After all, it appears, a clear pattern has now emerged. Democrats who have inappropriately touched or made an ugly pass at various women must resign amid a torrent of condemnation and disgrace. Republicans who have bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” without their consent, and who have been credibly accused of preying on and cornering minors, remain in completely good standing and deny everything. Surely at some point, voters will notice this double standard and reward the party with the higher and more consistent moral standards. Surely Republican women will pick the Dems in 2018 over their own abusive and hypocritical party.

And yet I wonder. The GOP has held some men responsible. Roger Ailes fell. Even Bill O’Reilly had to go. Last night, a conservative congressman, Trent Franks, announced his retirement because he apparently discussed surrogacy with female staffers; and another Republican, Blake Farenthold, may finally face the music on his own creation of a hostile work environment. Neither has so far been accused of touching or groping anyone — just making the lives of women working for them miserable. There’s enough ambiguity here, in other words, to deny the Dems a total moral victory.

And then there’s the power of tribalism to keep the GOP voters from switching to the Dems. In 2016, tribal loyalty overwhelmed any concerns about demonstrable sexual assault in the presidential election and led to a majority of white women voting for a pig. A year later, it appears to be having the same effect in Alabama. Roy Moore, in the last couple of weeks, has even seemed somewhat empowered by the backlash to the accusations. (The polls, however, still show a close race.).

And all of this will surely affect who comes forward in the future. A woman violated by a Democrat will be likelier to go public — because it gets results. A woman violated by a Republican will fear she could be easily demonized as a liar, a conspirator, or a fraud, and understandably be reluctant to put herself through that. And so the accusations may well mount against Democrats and liberals and diminish somewhat among Republicans and conservatives. Democratic standards for sexual conduct may well keep rising (any proof, for example, that Garrison Keillor ever recorded a single broadcast has now been erased from Minnesota Public Radio’s archives), while Republican standards (that signature on the yearbook photo is obviously forged) may keep falling. I see no reason why this ratchet shouldn’t continue, and why Democrats aren’t, in fact, unilaterally disarming themselves in what is a purely tribal war, where all objective moral or even epistemological standards become relative.

The right’s key edge on this is, it seems to me, shamelessness, a quality currently reified in the Supreme Leader. Ted Cruz’s staggering ability to pull off a transparently double standard on Franken and Moore, within a few seconds, is a classic example of a shame-free partisan at work. Drudge’s and Fox’s hysteria about Democratic and Hollywood iniquity is matched only by their celebration of Republican denials. It takes fathoms of cynicism to get away with this and unknown depths of denial to believe it. But the GOP has oodles of both on hand — and certainly more than the Dems. You get the feeling at times that if some Trump voters were to witness a brutal rape right in front of them, the first question they’d ask would be: Is the perpetrator a Republican or a Democrat? And did the victim vote for Hillary?

This is what Trump has enabled. It has won the GOP one election. It would be foolish, it seems to me, to underestimate its power.

See you next Friday.","the

Dear Money Mom,

Three of my best friends are trying to organize a girls’ trip to Miami this winter. I really wish I could go, but I just can’t afford it. I make a decent living as a physical therapist (about $90,000 per year), but we’re trying to pay off my husband’s student loans, and that takes priority right now. Still, I know I have a reputation for being cheap (I’m very careful with money), and I’m worried my friends will get touchy when I say this trip is outside my budget. I don’t want to throw my husband under the bus when I explain, either. How can I explain why I can’t go without sounding like I’m being overly defensive, or talking too much about money and making things even more awkward? Incomewise, all three of these friends are about on par with me (I think), but they spend a lot more freely than what I’m comfortable with, and I just can’t imagine how I could make this work without causing myself a ton of stress. How do I say no?

— Feeling Cheap

Dear Feeling,

Full disclosure: I would be the friend whose judgment you’re worried about. I get peeved when a person says that they “can’t afford” something that they technically can, but have simply ranked lower on their priority list. In your case, it’s not that you can’t afford this trip; it’s that you’ve chosen to put your money elsewhere — and responsibly so. Part of being an adult with disposable income is that you have every right to decide whether to earmark it for a plane ticket to Florida or your loved one’s student loans, and you’ve made a noble trade-off. Why not take ownership of your choice, instead of acting like the matter is out of your hands? A healthy sense of financial agency is rooted in knowing what you genuinely can’t pay for, as opposed to what you won’t, and your ability to communicate your decisions about the latter.

I was talking about this to a friend recently (let’s call her Alice, and I should mention that she, too, is helping her husband pay down his loans), and she told me I was being too simplistic. “For most people, the difference between ‘can’t’ and ‘won’t’ isn’t clear-cut,” she said. “Where’s the line? It’s not necessarily about how much money they have. It’s a matter of personal preference, and what they find stressful.” She likened this gray area to time management: For example, I’m the type that tries to squeeze everything in and believes that if I play my cards right, I’ll succeed (I usually don’t, but I’ll die trying). Meanwhile, Alice is always prompt, if not five minutes early to everything, and would rather turn down plans than risk cramping her schedule (and God forbid she arrive late). The point is, it’s impossible to evaluate someone else’s definition of “can’t” versus “won’t” when it comes to how they allot their resources — time, money, or otherwise. The spectrum is too nuanced, and people’s motives and boundaries are too messy and complex.

What’s more, saying “I can’t” is just easier sometimes. “When facing a conflict, we might frame it in a way that removes our control, so that we aren’t blamed for the resolution or outcome,” says Megan Ford, a financial therapist at the University of Georgia. “That’s why we say ‘I can’t’ when we mean ‘I won’t,’ or ‘I don’t want to.’ We want to save face and prevent hurt feelings.” People also don’t want to be subjected to Judge Judys like me. “If you’re honest about why you don’t want to spend money on something, the other person might be offended or even angry,” Alice added. “At the end of the day, it probably isn’t their business.”

Still, that doesn’t mean you should give up on your friends’ ability to understand where you’re coming from, financially and emotionally (after all, I was adamant about my “can’t afford it” rant until Alice explained her position). But first, since your embarrassment seems to be part of a behavioral pattern — “being cheap,” as you put it — you should investigate the source of this anxiety. “Someone who’s consistently frugal, even if they objectively have the means to pay for things, may find that they say ‘no’ as a reflex,” says Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist based in L.A. “What’s behind that? It may be that at some point earlier in their lives, they were taught that it’s inherently shameful and bad to need or want anything. Therefore, they have a subconscious belief that the only way to be good and safe and acceptable is if they need as little as possible.” Common signs of this mind-set include giving your money to family or friends, or hoarding it for hypothetical future expenses that never seem to materialize.

If “I can’t” is your knee-jerk default, it might not feel like a choice. But when you back up and ask why you’re keeping such a tight grip on your wallet, you may realize that saying no is a decision — one that’s shaped by your upbringing, values, resources, and what’s on the docket in your life. It also isn’t a bad thing. Passing up fun beach plans and fruity drinks to help pay down your significant other’s loans reflects loyalty, selflessness, and grit —qualities that plenty of us could use more of. “Placing a high value on financial security and organization is generally positive,” says Ford. “The question is, if you honor your own comfort level with spending, how does that affect your relationships? If it severely impacts them, then it’s worth examining further.”

If these friends love you enough to want to spend their vacation days with you, then at least one of them is probably down to chat about your financial unease — and it’s worth trying to do so, says Ford. “Ultimately, we need more honesty about money in our close friendships,” she continues. “The only way we become more confident in our own relationship with money is if we become more confident in exposing that part of our lives to others who care about us. As a culture, we aren’t very good at talking about money openly, and I think that breaking that taboo helps de-shame it.”

How you broach the topic should depend on the other person’s financial hang-ups, and be prepared that she may not respond perfectly. “Some people might feel rejected because they can’t connect with your experience of shame or fear,” says Clayman. “They might be frustrated. They might point out objective facts about your financial life, or misunderstand your anxiety, which could have the effect of making you feel more ashamed, and defensive.” They might also feel insecure about their own spending, and seek reassurance. Be aware of these possible reactions, and avoid comparing yourself to the person you’re talking to; your objective is to shed light on your vulnerability in a way that incites empathy, and helps find common ground. And remember: You don’t know the other person’s full situation, either.

Not all of your friends are going to be open to hearing about your money anxiety — not because it’s intrinsically embarrassing or stupid, but because they may have their own financial worries that they’d rather ignore. In that case, you’re better off avoiding a detailed justification. “It helps to state boundaries in the positive,” suggests Clayman. “You don’t want to say, ‘I’m not choosing to spend money on this trip, because I’m choosing this other thing.’ Instead, suggest another idea for a group gathering that’s more your speed.” And be genuine about it, says Ford: “When you do suggest an alternative, make sure that you really mean it. Don’t just use it as an excuse. It’s important to be thoughtful and not just try to get people off of your back.” Because if anything spoils friendships more than money, it’s insincerity.

It’s the most … wonderful time … of the year! There’ll be parties for hosting, celebrity outfits for roasting, and DJs spinning out in the sand. There’ll be scary gallery stories and tales of the glories of Basel drama long, long ago. Art Basel Miami: It’s the tackiest season of allllll!

Today marks the last day of Art Basel Miami 2017, and frankly, we’re exhausted.

During the daylight hours, Soho Beach House hosted “The Last Ten Years: Tracey Emin in Conversation with Alastair Gordon,” and by night, the spot had turned into a top party venue, where Jez Pereira DJ’ed the launch of Photo Butler at Art Basel with Anna Rothschild and Claudine De Niro. Over at the Faena Theatre, celebs including Morgan Brown, Gerard Butler, Camila Alves, and Matthew McConaughey hit up Duran Duran’s live show, and based on Butler’s and McConaughey’s very sweaty faces, the show was definitely fun (or at least hot).

Other popular nighttime events included the Kickstarter Dinner in honor of Art Basel and artist Glenn Kaino and Olympian Tommie Smith, The Art EDITION Hosted by The Academy New York and presented by Highsnobiety, and an INTERMIX x Caroline Constas Mer launch dinner, among a million parties, both planned and informal.

We can see the finish line of Art Basel Miami 2017. In honor of making it through the very long weekend, look back on all the best, most artfully outrageous looks that artists, celebrities, and guests wore in Miami Beach, below.","morgan brown gerard butler camila alves

Most of the time.",2017-12-08T11:00:00.569Z,new-york-magazine,8 Women on Therapy Horror Stories,http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/12/8-women-on-therapy-horror-stories.html,https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/science/2017/12/06/06-therapy-nightmares.w1200.h630.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Photo: Mike Whitby/EyeEm/Getty Images

More often than not, therapy is a great, healthy, wonderful — if painful — experience. It is a warm washcloth on your weary face, a safe haven for your scariest feelings, a place to swim in the ocean of you while effectively sipping chicken soup for the soul. It is Good Will Hunting’s “It’s not your fault” scene. But sometimes therapy is also finding out that your shrink hung himself just before your next session — as Sarah Silverman famously recalls. Sometimes therapy means secretly wishing your shrink would seduce you. Sometimes therapy is a combative relationship or a super-freaky one, and all sorts of dynamics in between. For those reasons and more, we asked eight women for their most hilarious and horrifying therapy stories ever.

She Only Talked About Herself

“I swear my therapist was only there to talk about herself. Every time I visited her, she would tell me about her ‘friend.’ It was obviously about her. And then there was the time that she was inspired by my silly fashion and bought the same sweater I always wore to our sessions. Of course, I never would have known this if she hadn’t shown up to our meeting wearing it — while I had mine on, too!”

She Set Me Up With a Freak

“My therapist set me up with another one of her patients, who was a writer. He wrote about the porn industry and lived, literally, in a closet. For our first date, he met me at work. I had to swing by my place to change before we went out. So I went to the bathroom to freshen up, and when I came out, he was lying naked on my bed. I had known him for five minutes. At first, I was confused as to why my therapist would set me up with such a schmuck, so I confronted her about it. She laughed it off, and then she immediately wanted me to pay my bill.”

She Didn’t Know My Name

“I saw this woman in Michigan before I moved to New York. I was just trying to get all my mental shit together, come to terms with my baggage, deal with my fear, etc., so I could leave in a good place. I was 23. I saw her for about six months, and she was pretty useless. She had sheepdog hair, so I couldn’t really see her face, and she wore sweaters with lots of bows on them. So one day, she was going on about how I didn’t know who I was or where I was going, and I said, ‘That’s what I said on my first day here. I don’t know who I am or where I’m going.’ Then she said, ‘Tell me: Who is Marlo?’

“My name is Marla. She didn’t know my name. I wanted to say that I didn’t know who Marlo was, but I’d be happy if she paid my bill. Instead, I left when the session was over, called her later, and told her I wasn’t coming back because she didn’t know my name. I resolved to use the money I was wasting on her for my move to New York, which was vastly more therapeutic. Right before I moved, I went out for a good-bye dinner with some friends and she was at the restaurant. It’s always weird to see your therapist in the wild. We waved, but I didn’t go over to say hi.

“The funny part? I can’t remember her name.”

He Fell Asleep

“In couples’ counseling with my then-husband, we both talked as we watched our therapist fall asleep. I remember looking at him and saying, ‘Damn, we are just not that interesting.’ My individual therapist was furious when I told her. And it happened more than once. Maybe we should have made some juicy shit up? On the same note, my latest therapist keeps looking at her clock watch as I’m talking. She is very obviously totally uninterested in my shit.”

She Was Obsessed With All Things Trump

“Around the election last year, my old therapist asked me every session if I was a Republican. When I reminded her that I was not, she would go on to talk to me about all her clients who she thinks supports Trump. Obsessed with Trump all day, all night. That is all she talked about. One day, we got into it. I went to her to talk about my stress at home, but she kept asking me about Hillary. I was a huge Hillary fan. So was she. Then she made the biggest mistake. She told me that an educated, rich, white politician (Hillary) had suffered more than any woman in the world. She said Hillary had endured the most as a woman … ever! I said, ‘More than enslaved black women?’ She said yes. I was like, Girl, bye. My next session was scheduled for the day after the election. Hillary lost. I was upset, but knew I couldn’t listen to her whine about Donald Trump for the next four to eight years. So I rescheduled my appointment. She fired me as a patient, saying I no-showed. Whatever.”

He Threatened to Take Away My Kids

“This is one of the most disturbing things that’s ever happened to me. I went to this therapist for about six months. I told him incredibly private things about my marriage, my parents, my children, etc. We really got into my own ‘Daddy Issues,’ and other issues. After a while, I just didn’t have the time for therapy anymore — I have four kids under age 7. So I sent him an email that I had to quit him out of the interest of time. He responded with the most threatening letter a mother could imagine; using all my personal secrets against me and even threatening to have my kids taken away from me because, he said, this decision to quit him made me seem very unstable to him. It felt like he was holding me hostage. I was nervous every day for months that someone was going to come to my house and take my kids. It’s been about a year now and he’s never done anything — but even talking about the situation freaks me out immensely.”

He Hate-Texted Me

“When I broke up with my therapist, he sent me a scathing text that could have been from a high-school mean girl. ‘Okay, sweetie. Just keep sweeping all of your problems under the rug. I’m sure it will work out perfectly for you. Best, John.’”

She Dissed Me at Whole Foods

“So I actually loved this therapist, Pam. She was helping me sort out a really tricky relationship with a man who was way too close with his family (a family I hated). At the time, it felt like Pam was the only person in my corner, and I just cherished her for making me feel less alone. So when I saw her at Whole Foods on a random Tuesday night, I was really psyched. I ran over to her in the pasta aisle and excitedly said ‘Hi!’ and gave her a big hug. She was totally bugged out by me. She couldn’t get away fast enough. I know you’re not supposed to engage in the real world, or whatever the rules are, but she was so incredibly cold to me that the whole relationship felt weird after that. Soon enough, I dumped the guy and moved back to New York, anyway.”","mike whitbyeyeemgetty

Here's what we learned:

1. After a three-point first half, the Jaguars-Seahawks tilt exploded into a back-and-forth thrill ride in the second half, which featured a 31-point third quarter. At one point, Jacksonville scored on three consecutive plays from scrimmage and with 10 minutes left to go in the game, the Jags had extended their lead to 27-10, thanks to brilliant throws from Blake Bortles and skillful special teams play. But Russell Wilson responded with yet another sterling fourth quarter, cutting the lead to 30-24 with two quick TD strikes. Seattle got the ball back with over two minutes to go, but immediately went four-and-out, with the final stop coming as a result of an uncharacteristic Jaguars blitz. Jacksonville took control the AFC South and its destiny with the win, while Seattle stayed one game behind the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC West.

2. All season long, the rub on the upstart Jaguars has been that they'd be a bona fide playoff contender, if only for that meddlesome schmo under center. On Sunday, Bortles proved his detractors wrong. The Jacksonville QB played his best game of the season on the biggest stage of his career (268 yards, 2 TDs), outplaying an MVP candidate across the field for much of the afternoon and proving himself worthy of carrying Jacksonville to a division title. Bortles showed pristine touch and accuracy on his two touchdown passes. His 75-yard bomb to rookie Keelan Cole (3 rec, 99 yards) was his longest completion since December of 2015. Sunday marked the first time this season that Bortles has thrown at least two touchdowns in consecutive weeks. His throwing motion is still wonky and he lacks a fastball, but in leading Jacksonville to the top of the AFC South, Bortles isn't just avoiding mistakes and getting out of the way of a good thing. He's pacing the Jags to victories.

3. It turns out Wilson can't do it all. Seattle's Swiss Army gunslinger stretched himself too thin against the league's best defense, throwing three interceptions on ill-advised deep balls, two intended for Doug Baldwin and one for Jimmy Graham. Give Jacksonville's All-World secondary credit -- it was the first time all season and only the fourth in 105 career games that Wilson had thrown at least three picks -- but Wilson was at fault for taking unnecessary shots fifty yards downfield. While Wilson did erupt in the fourth quarter, as he is wont to do, his errors put Seattle behind the eight ball early. By the time the Seahawks cut the lead to six, it was too late.

4. An already injury-riddled Seahawks defense saw two of its remaining stars exit with injuries on Sunday. Bobby Wagner had his All-Pro campaign temporarily derailed when he exited with a hamstring injury in the first half. Fellow linebacker K.J. Wright was ruled out with a concussion in the second half. Seattle has held its own with secondary stars Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor sidelined for the year; just last week, the Seahawks held the NFC-best Philadelphia Eagles to 10 points. But with injuries mounting and the NFC playoff race heating up, Seattle might have lost one too many Boomers to injury this week.

5. A testy affair between two playoff hopefuls had its share of personal foul penalties throughout the game, but things came to a head after the Jaguars had already clinched the victory. While Jacksonville was attempting its victory-formation kneel downs, Seahawks defensive ends Michael Bennett and Sheldon Richardson ignited a fracas. Bennett, Richardson and Leonard Fournette were all penalized, and Richardson was ejected. On the very next play, Seahawks defensive end Quinton Jefferson was penalized and ejected. On his way to the locker room, he confronted a group of Jaguars fans after he was nearly hit with a projectile thrown from the stands. Jefferson had to be restrained by Seahawks staff and ushered into the locker room. Fines and discipline will surely be coming.","jacksonvilles allworld secondary credit

Philadelphia (11-2) clinched the NFC East title with its 43-35 win over the Los Angeles Rams (9-4) on Sunday.

The Eagles overcame a 35-31 deficit in the fourth quarter of a back-and-forth affair, thanks to competent quarterbacking on the part of backup Nick Foles and two field goals from kicker Jake Elliott.

Carson Wentz has exited the Eagles' game against the Los Angeles Rams with a knee injury and has been ruled out.",2017-12-11T00:00:00Z,nfl-news,Carson Wentz (knee) ruled out of Rams-Eagles,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000890907/article/carson-wentz-knee-ruled-out-of-ramseagles,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/12/10/0ap3000000890945_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Philadelphia emerged from a back-and-forth affair victorious, but might have lost its most important player.

The Eagles believe Carson Wentz's season is over after the quarterback suffered an ACL injury in his knee during Philadelphia's 43-35 win over the Los Angeles Rams, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported. Wentz exited the contest late in third quarter and was ruled out shortly after heading to the locker room. Nick Foles replaced Wentz under center for Philly.

Wentz capped a 15-play, 75-yard drive with a fourth-down touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery before being examined on the sideline and leaving for the locker room. Four plays earlier in that drive, Wentz scrambled and dove into the end zone for what would have been a touchdown, if not for a holding penalty on tackle Lane Johnson. During the end zone dive, Wentz was hit by two Rams defenders, including one in the legs.

Wentz looked much less mobile during the plays that followed, including on the touchdown pass to Jeffery, in which the quarterback was statuesque before throwing to the receiver through traffic for the score.

Foles, owner of a 60.5 career completion percentage and a 57-25 TD-to-INT ratio, has plenty of experience as both a starter and a backup, getting his first shot with the Eagles from 2012-2014. Coincidentally, Foles was traded to the Rams when they were in St. Louis in 2015, but lasted just 11 games. He served as Alex Smith's capable backup last season in Kansas City before rejoining the Eagles during the most recent offseason.","los angeles rams

Coach Todd Bowles announced the New York Jets quarterback, who headed to the locker room after taking a hit to the hand late in the third quarter of Sunday's 23-0 loss to the Denver Broncos, broke his left non-throwing hand. He said he's unsure if the quarterback will be able to play in any of the Jets' final three games of the season.

Bryce Petty took over for the injured starter, but struggled, going just 2-for-9 for 14 yards in McCown's stead.

It was the second time in Sunday's game McCown needed Petty to relieve him. In the first half, after taking a shot to the midsection on a head-first slide, McCown took a play off to be tended to on the sidelines.

McCown had been having one of the most surprising seasons in the NFL this year. Prior to Sunday's game, the Jets quarterback piled up 2,880 yards, 18 touchdowns to just eight interceptions and posted a 96.7 quarterback rating.

""It just sucks, you know?"" McCown told reporters after the loss, fighting back tears. ""We started slow and were trying to get back going and guys were fighting and when you can't be out there for your guys, I think that's the hardest thing. So it's just disappointing. I just hate that it went this way today.""","quarterback

Dan Hanzus,Davante Adams isn't the first player to run up the tunnel after scoring a game-changing. But his celebration following his game-winning score Sunday was the perfect exclamation point for the Packers.,2017-12-10T22:36:00Z,nfl-news,Davante Adams and the beauty of the tunnel exit,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000890729/article/davante-adams-and-the-beauty-of-the-tunnel-exit,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/12/10/0ap3000000890749_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"This has been a special year -- a rebirth, really -- for touchdown celebrations in the NFL. And while we've all enjoyed the creativity that's come with this new post-score freedom of expression, there's something to be said for the standards.

Davante Adams isn't the first player to run up the tunnel after scoring a game-changing. Flipper Anderson did it against the Giants in the 1989 playoffs. Two years earlier, Bo Jackson disappeared into darkness on Monday Night Football against the Seahawks. Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict did it against the Steelers in the 2015 playoffs ... yeah, Bengals fans don't need to revisit that.

So no, Adams won't get points for originality. Still, the man deserves extra credit for an Irish goodbye that was both organic and symbolic. Organic in that the tunnel happened to be in right in front of him after he beat the Browns with his overtime score. Symbolic in that the maneuver was the equivalent of Adams yelling to his teammates, ""Let's get the hell of Cleveland, guys. We've got three more games to win and Aaron freakin' Rodgers is coming back.""

The Packers will need every minute of the next week to be physically recovered for Week 15. But you get the feeling Green Bay can't wait to get back on the field ... even if their star wideout didn't hesitate to get off it on Sunday.","aaron freakin rodgers

Around The NFL staff,Sunday of Week 14 is underway. Several teams are making their push for the playoffs. Here are some of our big takeaways from the early games today:,2017-12-10T21:49:00Z,nfl-news,NFL Week 14: Takeaways from Sunday's early games,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000890561/article/nfl-week-14-takeaways-from-sundays-early-games,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/12/10/0ap3000000890970_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Sunday of Week 14 is underway. Several teams are making their push for the playoffs. Here are some of our big takeaways from the early games today:

» Brett Hundley deserves some credit for keeping the Packers' playoff hopes alive, even as he heads back to the bench.

» A LeSean McCoy touchdown in overtime kept Buffalo in the AFC wild-card race.

» Even with quarterback Eli Manning behind center, the Giants' offense remains a bare-cupboard operation.

» The Chargers are a better squad right now than Kansas City and the club nobody wants to face in the playoffs.

1. MetLife Stadium exploded with raucous applause as Eli Manning returned under center following last week's inglorious benching. Manning opened 13-of-15 passing, throwing a pair of awful incompletions but making up for it with a pretty 35-yard connection to Evan Engram that helped set up the veteran's one-yard touchdown toss to Rhett Ellison. Manning's deep ball remains a mess, and it cost the Giants (2-11) on Sunday, but New York's offense -- with or without their ironman signal-caller -- remains a bare-cupboard operation that gave the team no shot in the second half, especially with wideout Roger Lewis dropping a catchable pass on third down that killed a critical Giants possession. A streak of seven straight punts down the stretch was only ended by a late-game interception from Manning that opened the door for the romp. Over and over, New York's unwatchable attack refused to live up to the moment.

2. Dez Bryant spent much of the first half as one reason Dallas (7-6) couldn't put away the Giants, dropping a pair of on-target throws including a deep shot down the sideline at New York's 6-yard line. With Dallas trailing 10-3, though, Bryant hauled in a Dak Prescott pass and raced 50 yards to pay dirt to tie the game. The Cowboys couldn't get out of their way before the break, but Prescott was magical in the third quarter with a next-level escape from Olivier Vernon to unfurl a chain-moving completion to Alfred Morris. The play of the game came midway through the fourth, when Prescott hit Cole Beasley on a connection that saw the marvelous slot receiver race through Big Blue defenders for 54 yards. Jason Witten's 20-yard touchdown catch on the following play put this game away as Dallas went on to score 27 unanswered points -- with a pair of scores by Rod Smith -- while Prescott threw for a career-high 332 yards.

3. The Cowboys saved their season with Sunday's tight win over the G-Men, but nothing grows easier for a team with its back against the wall in a massively top-heavy NFC. The task for Dallas is crystal clear: Take out Oakland next week and welcome Ezekiel Elliott back for season-closing tilts against the Seahawks and Eagles. It's no guarantee that 10 wins gets you into the postseason, but Dallas has a shot if they run the table.

-- Marc Sessler

1. While the Vikings (10-3) failed to take advantage of the opportunity to clinch the NFC North title, the Panthers (9-4) moved into a first-place tie with the Saints atop the NFC South. Carolina's offense was powered by a trio of big plays. In addition to Cam Newton's 62-yard read-option keeper, the 2015 MVP escaped pressure to find Devin Funchess in the end zone to open the second half. Jonathan Stewart raced 60 yards untouched to pay dirt on the opening drive of the first half to kick off the scoring. Stewart not only rushed for a career-best three scores, but also became the first back this season to clear the 100-yard mark against Minnesota's previously impregnable front seven.

2. By Mike Zimmer's own halftime admission to CBS' Tracy Wolfson, the Vikings were beating themselves with game-altering mistakes. The usually sure-handed Kyle Rudolph dropped a pass down the seam that would have gone for a big gainer. Although Adam Thielen came up clutch with a 52-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, he marred his All-Pro campaign by dropping a touchdown. Two plays later, he was victimized by the catch rule's ""process"" clause when he lost control of the ball as his elbow hit the ground at the back of the end zone. Just as Keenum was heating up for the first in a series of fourth-quarter comeback sallies, Stefon Diggs' drop bounced off his own helmet and into the hands of cornerback James Bradberry. Keenum played much better than his numbers would suggest, but this wasn't the fundamentally sound Vikings outfit we've come to expect.

3. Are the Vikes developing chinks in their armor? After taking just five sacks in his first 300 pass attempts over nine games this season, Keenum has gone down 10 times -- including six sacks by the Panthers -- on his last 104 attempts over the past three weeks. Already playing without right tackle Mike Remmers and center Pat Elflein, Keenum lost blindside protector Riley Reiff to an ankle injury on Sunday. Beyond the offensive-line issues, Kai Forbath appears to be battling a case of the yips, missing five kicks in the past four games.

-- Chris Wesseling

1. Despite losing six of their past seven games, the Chiefs (7-6) have a superior coaching staff to Oakland. It showed up on Sunday when Alex Smith often found his first read open, while the Raiders' offense had no clue how to attack a struggling Chiefs defense. The final score was misleading here, with Kansas City more than tripling the Raiders in total yardage through three quarters. A handful of unforced errors by the Chiefs kept the score from being 38-0 entering the final frame after another desultory effort by the Raiders in a big game.

2. A two-play sequence might have all but sunk this Raiders season, now 6-7 and 2-3 in the division. Receiver Amari Cooper re-injured his left ankle, never to return, while blocking on a run play in the second quarter. On the next snap, Derek Carr was picked off while getting hit on a throw. The Raiders (6-7) had 104 yards through nine drives against a Chiefs secondary without star cornerback Marcus Peters.

""There is no easy way to put this one. We sucked,"" Carr said after the game.

Carr was a big part of the problem, misfiring regularly, not seeing open receivers down the field and not looking comfortable in the pocket. His first 15 passes resulted in 32 yards, an interception and a sack. Late in the game, in hurry up mode, Carr was still taking check downs over the middle.

3. Chiefs defensive end Chris Jones took this game over in the first half. He ended at least three drives with two big sacks and another pressure that ruined a third down attempt. He also crushed Carr on a throw that was picked off. After a stretch of play with little to feel good about defensively, the Chiefs won the battle up front against the Raiders.

1. You could almost hear the iconic Sam Spence-composed orchestral music playing in the background while watching Bills (7-6) and Colts players trudging through ankle-deep snow and blizzard-like conditions that only John Facenda could ever give justice to accurately describing. Still, the football-game-in-a-snow-globe scene won't just be remembered for its vivid picturesque quality -- it featured one of the most exciting finishes of the season. After the Colts (3-10) managed to tie it in the closing minutes of regulation in thrilling fashion, LeSean McCoy scored on a 21-yard walk-off sprint in overtime to keep Buffalo very much in the AFC wild-card race. McCoy's touchdown was set up by a spectacular 34-yard catch by Deonte Thompson on a pass from Joe Webb, who came in for the injured Nathan Peterman during the second half. McCoy finished with a season-high 158 yards on 32 carries and Peterman completed five of 10 passes for 57 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game to be evaluated for a head injury.

2. Until the final minutes of regulation, the Colts more or less played like a team that's used to having a retractable roof overhead. After lying dormant for most of the game, Jacoby Brissett, Frank Gore and the Colts pieced together an incredible 19-play drive that included a pair of fourth-down conversions and culminated in a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jack Doyle. Chuck Pagano then tried to win it all on a two-point conversion attempt only for the Colts to be called for offensive pass interference. Then, after some foot-induced snow plowing by the Colts' special teams unit to give him a more sturdy ball placement, Adam Vinatieri made an amazing, 43-yard extra-point to force overtime. It was truly spectacular feat for the Colts even if he ended up missing another 43-yard field-goal attempt just before the end of regulation following an interception by Matthias Farley. Gore finished with a season best 130 yards rushing on a career-high 36 carries and Brissett completed 11 of 22 passes for 69 yards.

97 combined rush attempts by the @Colts and @buffalobills today is the most in a game since Week 10, 1981 when the Chiefs & Bears combined for 100 rush attempts â NFL Research (@NFLResearch) December 10, 2017

3. The near-blinding conditions made things difficult for each team's offense to literally and figuratively find traction, but for a brief moment at the end of the first half, everything clicked for Buffalo. Peterman, starting in place for the injured Tyrod Taylor, found Kelvin Benjamin on a beautiful 21-yard pass. How Benjamin managed to see the ball through the driving snow and use his 6-foot-6 frame to perfection to make the catch over Colts rookie corner Kenny Moore is anyone's guess. On the next play, Peterman connected with Benjamin again on an 8-yard pass for the game's only score. The eight-play drive, which benefited early on from a 23-yard plow by McCoy early on, kept the Bills ahead for most of the game.

-- Austin Knoblauch

1. The white-hot Chargers (7-6) surged out of the gate with scoring drives on their first five possessions in a game that looked lost for Washington right away. Veteran passer Philip Rivers was pristine, using the marvelous Keenan Allen (6/111) as an anchoring force and finding Tyrell Williams (4/132/1) for a 75-yard touchdown on a play that saw Redskins cover man Josh Norman burnt to a crisp. This take-no-prisoners attack played with urgency from wire to wire, with Rivers thriving against the blitz and making good use of tight end Hunter Henry (4/50/1). After the Bolts piled up 354 yards before the break -- their most in a first half since at least 1991, and the most by any team since 2010 -- the Chargers kept their foot on the gas as Rivers tossed a 51-yard strike to Allen on a razzle-dazzle downfield strike that set up Melvin Gordon's 1-yard touchdown burst to rubber stamp the blowout. Crossing the 30-point barrier for the fourth straight game, Los Angeles has emerged as one of the league's most fascinating developing storylines.

2. The Redskins (5-8) came out of the gate with Kirk Cousins countering a fierce Chargers pass rush with a rash of quick throws. The veteran quarterback looked good tossing a 23-yard scoring strike to the ageless Vernon Davis, but managed just 112 passing yards with a pick in the first half before throwing for just seven yards in the third quarter as the game slipped away in vicious fashion. While the defense allowed yardage and points galore, Washington's offense was held scoreless for 37-plus minutes at one stage until cornerback Bashaud Breeland dialed up a late-game, 96-yard pick six of Kellen Clemens -- the only real mistake of the day for the Chargers.

3. Sunday's win keeps Los Angeles notched atop the AFC West with the Chiefs, who will host the Bolts on Saturday in a high-octane divisional showdown. No reason to look beyond that tilt, but the Chargers then go on the road to play the Jets before hosting the flat-lining Raiders in the regular-season finale. One of the weirder, friskier teams in the AFC as January nears, the Chargers are a better squad right now than Kansas City and the club nobody wants to face in the playoffs. They've caught fire at the ideal time.

-- Marc Sessler

1. The (8-5) Titans dropped to second place in the AFC South, as the (9-4) Jaguars earned a victory over the Seahawks. Tennessee's defense held up its end of the bargain, racking up eight sacks and shutting Arizona out of the end zone on multiple goal-to-go scenarios. The Titans have recorded 20 sacks over the past three weeks, more than the Buccaneers (17) have managed all season. The offense, however, continued its struggle to find an identity, with DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry limited to 2.84 yards per on a combined 19 carries. Marcus Mariota remains a disappointment, uncorking two more interceptions with faulty mechanics as the primary culprit. We understand Mike Mularkey's desire for an exotic offense, but why was Mariota throwing to rookie cornerback Adoree Jackson on fourth down with the game on the line?

2. Now leading the NFC in receptions (87), Larry Fitzgerald had cruised past Marvin Harrison, Steve Smith Sr., Tim Brown, Tony Gonzalez and Isaac Bruce on the all-time receiving yards list entering Week 14. With Sunday's 44 yards bringing his career total to 15,311, he bypassed Randy Moss (15,292) for third place. Fitzgerald will have to wait until 2018 to catch Terrell Owens (15,934), who is 6,961 yards behind Jerry Rice, the greatest there ever was. If not for a fourth-quarter overthrow by Blaine Gabbert, Fitzgerald would have added an easy 14-yard touchdown to Sunday's stat line.

3. Arizona's lost season shouldn't overshadow the work of outside linebacker Chandler Jones, who took over the NFL's sack lead (14) while adding three tackles for loss and another hit on Mariota. Among the most disruptive edge rushers in the league, Jones is also tied with Houston's Jadeveon Clowney for the most tackles (25) at or behind the line of scrimmage this season.

-- Chris Wesseling

1. Jordan Howard and the Bears' run game took advantage of an injury-ravaged Bengals defense that was missing linebackers Vontaze Burfict and Nick Vigil, corner Dre Kirkpatrick, safety Shawn Williams, and banged-up Pro Bowl defensive tackle Geno Atkins played sparingly. Against a Cincy D that appeared to move in slow motion, Howard dashed through the gut repeatedly, finishing with 147 yards and two touchdowns on 23 carries. The seas parted time after time for the running back, who wasn't even touched on a 21-yard touchdown gash to open the scoring. A Chicago (4-9) ground game stymied in recent weeks was averaging 7.2 yards per rush before two final dives salting away the clock dropped the number to 6.1.

2. Mitchell Trubisky played his best game of the season. With the run game galloping, the rookie quarterback took advantage of play-action and bootlegs to find huge throwing lanes. We didn't see any field-stretching connections, but Trubisky got the ball out quick on slants and crossers, hitting eight different targets. The rookie went 25-of-32 passing for 271 yards, 8.5 yards per attempt, a TD pass and a four-yard scamper score. Trubisky continually picked on the Bengals depleted linebacker corps in space, especially sixth-round rookie Jordan Evans, for chunk gains. The Bengals (5-8) allowed Kendall Wright to catch 10 passes for 107 yards. A Bears offense that earned 287 yards combined the past two weeks generated 256 in the first half alone on Sunday. Chicago finished with 482 yards and 29 first downs. Scoring 27 straight points, the 33-7 win marked the Bears' first game with 28-plus points since November 15, 2015.

3. If the Marvin Lewis era is coming to an end, it's limping to the finish. Yes, injuries stemming from Monday night's physical loss to the Steelers decimated the Bengals. The injuries don't explain the listless, sleepwalking squad Lewis put on the field Sunday. Defenders missed tackle after tackle. The flagging offense looked disjointed, with the Andy Dalton-A.J. Green connection lost in the wilderness the past six quarters. Dalton tossed an interception on a tipped ball to Green and could have thrown several others. Green was later stripped with the Bengals driving in the 4th quarter. Both players hit the bench before the end of the fourth quarter. Outside of Giovani Bernard taking advantage of limited touches as the featured back, there was nothing positive for Cincinnati to take away Sunday. ""I'm at a loss of words everybody...today. Our football team I thought had a good week of preparation and we did not play close to the kind of football to win the football game today we needed to,"" Lewis told reporters after the game.

-- Kevin Patra

1. The Jets overachieved with a roster that wasn't playoff ready for most of this season, but in Sunday's 23-0 loss to the Broncos, New York looked like the team most pundits had them pegged to be prior to the season. The offense was abysmal against a Broncos defense that had leaked oil all year (giving up 30.1 points per game the last eight weeks). In the first half, the Jets had 27 rushing yards on 11 attempts while Josh McCown, who lost a fumble, completed just three of six passes for 18 yards and a pick. It got worse in the second half. McCown (hand) got hurt and couldn't finish the game. The team couldn't move the ball. In the end, the Jets finished with a whopping 100 total yards, six total first downs and two turnovers.

2. Bryce Petty earned his first run of the season with McCown out because of a hand injury and there wasn't too much exciting from the young New York QB. He went 2-for-9 for 14 yards. He missed a fourth-down throw high to Jermaine Kearse in the third quarter and later in the fourth quarter missed an open Robby Anderson for what would have been a big gain. Most of his time under center was spent handing the ball off, as John Morton and the Jets clearly didn't trust the young signal-caller, even in a 23-0 game. New York, with its slim playoff hopes all but over with Sunday's loss, appears headed for another long offseason looking for a franchise QB.

3. Demaryius Thomas showed he still has it if the Broncos ever need it. The wide receiver is having his worst year since his sophomore season in 2011, but he proved he can still be a playmaker if Denver feeds him the football. The big wideout, despite a couple bad drops, scored a pretty jump-ball TD over Morris Claiborne early in the game and finished with eight grabs for 93 yards and a score on 12 targets.

1. Brett Hundley still looked a lot like the quarterback we've seen in the last month or so, but in Green Bay's most important game to date, he came through when it was needed most. The quarterback engineered a drive of 13 plays for 75 yards to cut Green Bay's deficit to seven, then utilized great field position gained via a 65-yard Trevor Davis punt return to tie the game in the final seconds. While Cleveland inexplicably took the pressure off Hundley in the fourth quarter (and in overtime, at which point the Browns rushed only three on a play), the quarterback shifted from attempting to air it out to taking what the defense gave him. It resulted in a sterling line (35 of 46, 265 yards, three touchdowns) and another overtime victory.

2. The Packers are alive. Green Bay was on the mat at an eight-count on Sunday before rising, wobbling and soldiering through the later rounds of its bout with Cleveland before scoring a knockout punch that downed its winless opponent and preserved its playoff hopes. Aaron Rodgers is slated to return next week, and the Packers have somehow exited the Brett Hundley period with a 7-6 mark and a shot at a Wild Card berth.

Green Bay's sleepwalk through the second and third quarters should be worrisome, but the Packers should also be applauded for waking up before it was too late. Against most teams, it would have been too late; against this Browns squad, it thankfully wasn't. With Rodgers returning, Green Bay becomes one of the most intriguing teams to watch in the final three weeks. Hundley deserves some credit for that, even as he heads back to the bench.

3. For Cleveland, this one hurts more than the rest. A team struggling to hang onto leads and just finish a game, any game, again fails in its most epic collapse of the franchise's most nightmarish season ever. This time, it came by way of conservative defense (Browns fans will think back to the team's lone playoff appearance since 1999 when reading this), allowing Hundley -- who threw for 84 yards last week in an overtime win over Tampa Bay -- complete passes of 9 yards, 5 yards, 9 yards, 6 yards...you get the point. Hundley dinked and dunked the Packers to a touchdown to cut Cleveland's lead to 21-14, and a special teams gaffe on the part of the Browns gave Green Bay great field position, of which the Packers took advantage. A DeShone Kizer interception and ensuing Green Bay touchdown completed the comeback and capped a colossal meltdown on the part of the Browns, who saw their best chance to avoid an 0-16 season evaporate in a quarter and a half.

All of the goodwill gained from the hiring of new general manager John Dorsey and his decision to cut Kenny Britt on his first day on the job melted into oblivion as Davante Adams crossed the goal line in overtime. The offseason remains bright for a young Browns team that still hasn't learned how to finish a win. But these next three weeks won't be fun for Cleveland.

--Nick Shook

1. Apparently Matthew Stafford's injured hand is all right. The Lions quarterback did what he seemingly always does in Lions wins, throwing for huge yards and leading a late fourth-quarter, game-winning drive. The Lions quarterback started out the game on fire, going 17-for-19 for 210 yards and a touchdown. Despite a five-pass stretch that featured two interceptions following that start, the QB finished strong, ultimately ending the game 36-for-44 for 381 yards. His 6-for-6 performance on the Lions' final drive put Detroit in position for Matt Prater's game-winning 46-yarder. The Lions (7-6) go as Stafford goes, and on Sunday, Stafford certainly went.

2. This one was less about who played football better and more about who could hang on to the football better. The amount of turnovers, and the amount of near turnovers, were staggering. Stafford threw two picks. Jameis Winston threw two INTs. The two teams combined for five fumbles (three lost by Tampa, one lost by Detroit). In the end, the Bucs' minus-two turnover ratio was probably the difference in the game.

3. Sunday's loss was yet another reason the disappointment in Tampa Bay should be at an all-time high. Even with Mike Evans banged up, the Bucs (4-9) showed potential all over their offense. Rookies O.J. Howard (four catches, 54 yards, one touchdown) and Chris Godwin (five catches, 68 yards) flashed star power. Adam Humphries (three catches, 25 yards) was a playmaker in the slot. DeSean Jackson (four catches, 41 yards; one rush, 23 yards) was a speedy threat both down the field and on gadget plays. It's one of the NFL's biggest mysteries as to why the Bucs aren't more productive on the field, though Winston's turnovers (three more on Sunday) likely don't help matters. Perhaps that's why the head coach and quarterback are butting heads.

-- Edward Lewis

1. For the first time since 2014, the San Francisco 49ers (3-10) have won consecutive road games. The Niners' swap to quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo continues to pay dividends for Kyle Shanahan and Co. Garoppolo tallied 334 yards passing and logged his second touchdown pass as a Niner. Against a tough Texans defense featuring a recently-reinstated Brian Cushing, the Niners stuck to air connecting with Marqise Goodwin for 106 receiving yards. Running back Carlos Hyde also racked up 78 rushing yards on 14 carries.

2. Texans quarterback Tom Savage exited the game after suffering a concussion in the second quarter. A backup to the backup, T.J. Yates tossed the team's only two touchdown passes of the day, both to receiver DeAndre Hopkins. Hopkins continues to be remarkable week after week despite playing with multiple signal callers this year (let alone many more throughout his stint in Houston). Hopkins tallied more yards (151) than the rest of his teammates combined. Though Savage's status remains uncertain for next week, the Texans (4-9) can always rely on Hopkins to keep it interesting.

3. Speaking of interesting -- In a season of kicking woes across the league, 49ers kicker Robbie Gould was perfect again today. Gould extends his kicking streak to 14 for 14 after nailing four field goals (and posting 12 of the 49ers' 26 points).

Gregg Rosenthal,The Chiefs dominated the Raiders for three quarters on the way to a 26-15 victory Sunday. Derek Carr had a harsh review for how his team performed after the game.,2017-12-10T21:49:00Z,nfl-news,Derek Carr after Chiefs dominate Raiders: 'We sucked',http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000890593/article/derek-carr-after-chiefs-dominate-raiders-we-sucked,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/12/10/0ap3000000890653_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The Kansas City Chiefs dominated the Oakland Raiders for three quarters on the way to a 26-15 victory Sunday. Here's what we learned:

1. Despite losing six of their past seven games, the Chiefs have a superior coaching staff to Oakland. It showed up on Sunday when Alex Smith often found his first read open, while the Raiders' offense had no clue how to attack a struggling Chiefs defense. The final score was misleading here, with Kansas City more than tripling the Raiders in total yardage through three quarters. A handful of unforced errors by the Chiefs kept the score from being 38-0 entering the final frame after another desultory effort by the Raiders in a big game.

2. A two-play sequence might have all but sunk this Raiders season, now 6-7 and 2-3 in the division. Receiver Amari Cooper re-injured his left ankle, never to return, while blocking on a run play in the second quarter. On the next snap, Derek Carr was picked off while getting hit on a throw. The Raiders had 104 yards through nine drives against a Chiefs secondary without star cornerback Marcus Peters.

""There is no easy way to put this one. We sucked,"" Carr said after the game.

Carr was a big part of the problem, misfiring regularly, not seeing open receivers down the field and not looking comfortable in the pocket. His first 15 passes resulted in 32 yards, an interception and a sack. Late in the game, in hurry up mode, Carr was still taking check downs over the middle.

3. Chiefs defensive end Chris Jones took this game over in the first half. He ended at least three drives with two big sacks and another pressure that ruined a third down attempt. He also crushed Carr on a throw that was picked off. After a stretch of play with little to feel good about defensively, the Chiefs won the battle up front against the Raiders.

4. Kareem Hunt put up 138 yards and a touchdown from scrimmage, including 116 on the ground, in his first game over 100 yards from scrimmage since ... he last played the Raiders. Hunt's productivity is a great sign heading a game against the Chargers next week (on NFL Network) that could decide the AFC West.

5. Raiders coach Jack Del Rio could start feeling some heat if this season continues to go south. He replaced his offensive coordinator after last season and his defensive coordinator a few weeks ago and the team continues to look overmatched too often.

""We had high hopes heading into today. It was a big day, a big moment, and we didn't play well,"" Del Rio said after the game.","oakland raiders

Chris Wesseling,"Cam Newton shook off a fourth-quarter interception to Andrew Sendejo, juking the Vikings safety on the next drive en route to a 62-yard run that set the stage for Jonathan Stewart TD for a 31-24 win.",2017-12-10T21:38:00Z,nfl-news,Panthers snap Vikings' eight-game winning streak,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000890555/article/panthers-snap-vikings-eightgame-winning-streak,http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/12/10/0ap3000000890546_thumbnail_200_150.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Cam Newton shook off a fourth-quarter interception to Andrew Sendejo, juking the Minnesota safety on the next drive en route to a 62-yard run that set the stage for Jonathan Stewart's game-winning touchdown leap. Here's what we learned in the Carolina Panthers' thrilling 31-24 victory over the Vikings in Week 14:

1. While the Vikings failed to take advantage of the opportunity to clinch the NFC North title, the Panthers moved into a first-place tie with the Saints atop the NFC South. Carolina's offense was powered by a trio of big plays. In addition to Newton's 62-yard read-option keeper, the 2015 MVP escaped pressure to find Devin Funchess in the end zone to open the second half. Stewart raced 60 yards untouched to pay dirt on the opening drive of the first half to kick off the scoring. Stewart not only rushed for a career-best three scores, but also became the first back this season to clear the 100-yard mark against Minnesota's previously impregnable front seven.

2. By Mike Zimmer's own halftime admission to CBS' Tracy Wolfson, the Vikings were beating themselves with game-altering mistakes. The usually sure-handed Kyle Rudolph dropped a pass down the seam that would have gone for a big gainer. Although Adam Thielen came up clutch with a 52-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, he marred his All-Pro campaign by dropping a touchdown. Two plays later, he was victimized by the catch rule's ""process"" clause when he lost control of the ball as his elbow hit the ground at the back of the end zone. Just as Keenum was heating up for the first in a series of fourth-quarter comeback sallies, Stefon Diggs' drop bounced off his own helmet and into the hands of cornerback James Bradberry. Keenum played much better than his numbers would suggest, but this wasn't the fundamentally sound Vikings outfit we've come to expect.

3. Are the Vikes developing chinks in their armor? After taking just five sacks in his first 300 pass attempts over nine games this season, Keenum has gone down 10 times -- including six sacks by the Panthers -- on his last 104 attempts over the past three weeks. Already playing without right tackle Mike Remmers and center Pat Elflein, Keenum lost blindside protector Riley Reiff to an ankle injury on Sunday. Beyond the offensive-line issues, Kai Forbath appears to be battling a case of the yips, missing five kicks in the past four games.

4. Victories by the Panthers and Falcons bode poorly for the NFC's three-pack of 7-6 teams. The way it stands now, there's certainly no guarantee that a 10-6 record will guarantee a postseason berth. The Packers, Lions and Cowboys have to hope that two of the NFC South's trio of contenders cannibalize the weakest member in the season's final three weeks.","james bradberry keenum

On Sunday, he reacquainted himself with the end zone during the Cleveland Browns' 27-21 overtime loss to the Green Bay Packers.

Gordon's 17-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter knotted the contest up at 7-7 and gave Cleveland's fan base a bigger shot of enthusiasm in one play than it has received all season. It was also Gordon's first visit to paydirt since Week 15 of the 2013 season. Just watch for yourself:

Consider the basic physics of this play: A pass thrown by a strong-armed NFL quarterback, down the middle of the field, between defenders, caught by a long-armed receiver with only his hands, with his bottom hand at an awkward angle. The sheer hand strength necessary is marvelous.

OK, we're done drooling over the catch. Gordon had three catches for 69 yards and that score above through a quarter and a half of play on Sunday -- the Packers limited him from there and rallied for a 27-21 win in OT. Cleveland's leading receiver entering Sunday was running back Duke Johnson (it's OK to laugh), who tallied 52 receptions for 456 yards and two touchdowns. It's not unrealistic to think Gordon, at this pace, could eclipse him by the end of the 2017 season -- in just five games played.

That's the value a receiver like Gordon brings to any team, and especially to a talent-bare one like the Browns. Oh, and we can't forget -- it's sunglasses time in cold, overcast Cleveland:","cleveland browns

He is scheduled to be re-evaluated in six weeks.

ST. LOUIS -- Forward Jaden Schwartz was placed on injured reserve by the St. Louis Blues on Sunday with an injury to his right ankle that will keep him out for at least six weeks.

""It [stinks],"" Blues center Brayden Schenn said. ""He's having a great year, doing it all for us at both ends of the ice and making stuff happen. He can definitely be in the conversation, (in) my opinion, our MVP thus far this season.""

Schwartz, 25, has 35 points (14 goals, 21 assists), second on the Blues behind Schenn (15-21-36) and is tied for ninth in the NHL with Edmonton Oilers center Connor McDavid (11-24-35). He's averaging 19:12 of ice time per game, and has 247 points (103 goals, 144 assists) and 81 penalty minutes in 348 NHL regular-season games.

Coach Mike Yeo said initial X-rays were negative after the game Saturday but the Blues wanted to conduct further tests, including an MRI, after swelling went down and found more than what they initially thought.

""That's why we got the MRI,"" Yeo said. ""We were hopeful but talking to [Schwartz], there was enough concern that we get back here and get the MRI. Obviously, some bad news.

""It's a tough break. I feel really bad for [Schwartz], just the year he's having, the way he's put himself on the map in our league, the recognition he's getting has been so well deserved, so I feel bad for him and obviously it's a loss for our group.""

The Blues, who play the Buffalo Sabres at Scottrade Center on Sunday (7 p.m. ET; FS-MW, MSG-B, NHL.TV), are second in the Western Conference (20-8-2) behind the Los Angeles Kings (20-8-3). Their 42 points are two behind the Tampa Bay Lightning (21-6-2) for first in the NHL.

Forward Ivan Barbashev was recalled from Chicago of the American Hockey League. Barbashev, 21, has eight points (four goals, four assists) in 17 AHL games this season.

PITTSBURGH -- Ron Hainsey walked out of the Pittsburgh Penguins offices Saturday night, smiling and clutching a box in his hand.

Traded to the Penguins by the Carolina Hurricanes on Feb. 23, Hainsey, 36, enjoyed a Stanley Cup Playoff ride that ended with him hoisting the trophy he had so coveted during his 14 NHL seasons.

Now here he was, receiving his championship jewelry after helping defeat the team he'd won it with.

""It was very nice,"" Hainsey said. ""What can you say, it's a special place, special organization, from ownership down. There are people over there who I've known since I was 8 years old and obviously got to know a lot more in my short couple months. Special place, special team for sure.""

Hainsey, who signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the Maple Leafs on July 1, said the Maple Leafs have improvements to make to reach the Penguins' heights.

""We still have a long way to go, and it's early,"" he said. ""But guys are learning and you can see it's pointed in the right direction.""

The Maple Leafs aspire to be what the Penguins are. A victory at the home of the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions shows they are taking steps, however small they might be, in that direction.

Motivation was everywhere the Maple Leafs looked, whether it be Hainsey's ring, the yellow-and-black Stanley Cup banners dangling from the rafters or just the sight of Sidney Crosby, who has won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP two consecutive times.

""To come here and win against a team like that, in their home rink, with those championship banners up there, it's big,"" said Maple Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen, who made 33 saves. ""It gives you an idea of where you are and how far you still need to go to reach your goal.""

Andersen said seeing Hainsey's ring should stoke the desire of his teammates to accomplish the same thing.

""I remember when I was in Anaheim (2013-16), I saw Dustin Penner's two rings, one that he won with the Los Angeles Kings (2012), the other with the Ducks (2007),"" Andersen said. ""It drives you. You see one and you say, 'I want one of those.'""

During his Stanley Cup ride last spring, Hainsey learned the importance of a supporting cast for a championship team. As much as players like Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Phil Kessel were the foundation of the title run, the accomplishment would not have been achieved without the significant contributions of players like Jake Guentzel, Conor Sheary and Bryan Rust.

On Saturday, the Maple Leafs used the same recipe for success.

In a game hyped as Crosby against Auston Matthews, the Maple Leafs center was held without a point and did not have a shot for the second time in his NHL career, a span of 108 regular-season games.

Enter the Mitchell Marner-Tyler Bozak-James van Riemsdyk line, which accounted for three of the four goals. Bozak ended a 13-game goal drought by scoring twice, the first time he'd scored since Nov. 4 against the St. Louis Blues.

The most important goal came at 18:13 of the second period. With the Penguins having cut a 3-0 Maple Leafs lead to 3-2, Bozak scored 22 seconds after Malkin had brought the hosts to within one.

""That was big in terms of shifting momentum,"" Bozak said. ""It was nice to get some bounces and have the puck follow us around a bit.""

Just 24 hours after facing Crosby, the Maple Leafs go up against another of the sport's marquee players, Connor McDavid, when they host the Edmonton Oilers at Air Canada Centre on Sunday (7 p.m. ET; NHLN, SN, TVA Sports, NHL.TV).

For Hainsey, the back-to-back games against two of the League's top stars are just the latest tests in the Maple Leafs' pursuit of success. And maybe, just maybe, he said, a playoff date against the Penguins might be down the road.

""Certainly, we're all fans at some level and that would be a cool series with a chance to go to the Final, or whatever, but there is a long way to go,"" he said. ""It's only [Dec. 9], or whatever, so it's all about putting ourselves in a good position, and I'm sure they're doing the same thing over there.

""They've played a lot of hockey the past couple of years and they know. It's about putting yourself in a good position come April, and we'll see where it goes from there.""

Ron Hainsey knows of what he speaks. And now he has the Stanley Cup ring to prove it.","mitchell marnertyler bozakjames van riemsdyk

DraftKings value picks for Sunday

CENTER

Value pick: Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, EDM ($5,300 at TOR). The Edmonton Oilers center is on a three-game point streak, and has four points (two goals, two assists) and seven shots on goal in his past five games. Nugent-Hopkins is centering Edmonton's second line between forwards Patrick Maroon ($4,700) and Michael Cammalleri ($3,200). He has eight points (two goals, six assists) and is averaging 2.7 DraftKings points per game in 15 road games.

Spend up for: Brayden Schenn, STL ($6,700 vs BUF)

Video: PHI@EDM: Nugent-Hopkins taps home rebound in front

WING

Value pick: Alex DeBrincat, CHI ($5,200 vs ARI). The Chicago Blackhawks face the Arizona Coyotes (7 p.m. ET; WGN, FS-A, NHL.TV), who play the second leg of a back-to-back set. DeBrincat has been skating on their first line with Jonathan Toews ($6,400) and Brandon Saad ($5,700). He has points in back-to-back games and nine points (five goals, four assists) in his past 10 games while averaging 3.4 DraftKings points per game. His 21 points (12 goals, nine assists) are fourth among rookies this season.

Spend up for: Evander Kane, BUF ($7,000 at STL)

Video: BUF@CHI: DeBrincat fires wrister past Lehner for PPG

DEFENSE

Value pick: Marc-Edouard Vlasic, SJS ($4,100 vs MIN). The San Jose Sharks defenseman scored his third goal of the season against the Ottawa Senators on Saturday. He had five blocked shots and two shots on goal for 6.5 DraftKings points. Vlasic has five points (two goals, three assists), 21 blocked shots and 26 shots on goal in his past 10 games. He is averaging 3.7 DraftKings points per game in that span, which would rank third-highest among defensemen in DraftKings on Sunday.

Spend up for: Morgan Rielly, TOR ($5,200 vs EDM)

Video: OTT@SJS: Vlasic blasts slap shot past Anderson

GOALTENDER

Value pick: Martin Jones, SJS ($7,700 vs MIN). Despite Jones' recent struggles, the San Jose Sharks goaltender is a good option against the Minnesota Wild. Jones is 7-4-1 with a 2.47 goals-against average and is averaging 4.5 DraftKings fantasy points per game in 12 home starts. He has a 2.24 GAA in seven starts against the Wild, who have scored three goals or less in eight of their past 10 games.

Video: SJS@WSH: Jones denies Ovechkin with pad stop

12:20 p.m.

Schwartz out at least six weeks with ankle injury

St. Louis Blues left wing Jaden Schwartz is out at least six weeks with an injury to his right ankle sustained in the first period of the game Saturday against the Detroit Red Wings. He will be re-evaluated in six weeks.

Schwartz (93 percent owned in Yahoo) scored his 14th goal of the season before he was injured blocking a shot. He has 35 points (14 goals, 21 assists) and 63 shots on goal in 30 games.

Schwartz had been skating on the Blues' second line with Brayden Schenn and Alexander Steen (45 percent owned). Steen (C/LW/RW) has points in back-to-back games and has 15 points (three goals, 12 assists) and 61 shots on goal in 24 games this season. He is the top in-house replacement of Schwartz for fantasy owners.

Forward Dmitrij Jaskin (1 percent owned) skated the most amount of time with Schenn and Steen for the remainder of the game Saturday. Jaskin ($3,200) would be a good DraftKings value option against the Buffalo Sabres on Sunday (7 p.m. ET; FS-MW, MSG-B, NHL.TV). He has eight points (two goals, six assists) and is averaging 2.2 DraftKings points per game in 14 home games this season.

Another in-house option to replace Schwartz in fantasy lineups is Vladimir Sobotka (14 percent owned). He has six points (one goal, five assists) in his past seven games and has been skating with Vladimir Tarasenko and Paul Statsny.

The Blues recalled forward Ivan Barbashev (C/LW, owned in fewer than 1 percent of Yahoo leagues) from Chicago of the American Hockey League. Barbashev has no points in six games this season but finished last season on a four-game point streak during his trial on the top line with Tarasenko.

Yanni Gourde (C/RW, Tampa Bay Lightning; 15 percent owned), Tanner Pearson (LW, Los Angeles Kings; 7 percent owned), Phillip Danault (C/LW, Montreal Canadiens; 7 percent owned) and Patrick Maroon (LW, Edmonton Oilers; 50 percent owned) are other viable replacement options available in the majority of Yahoo fantasy leagues.

Bozak, Marner deliver for Maple Leafs

Forwards Tyler Bozak and Mitch Marner came up big for the Toronto Maple Leafs in a 4-3 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday, helping the Maple Leafs to their fifth win in their past seven games. The pair have been skating on the third line with forward James van Riemsdyk.

Marner (84 percent owned in Yahoo) is dual-eligible (C/RW). He had three assists and two shots on goal, a multipoint game that ended a seven-game pointless streak. Marner (231st in Yahoo standard leagues) has been moved around the lineup this season and has fallen short of his draft expectations (33.3 ADP in Yahoo). He has 19 points (two goals, 17 assists) in 30 games, on pace for a 10-point drop off from his 61-point rookie season last season.

Bozak (7 percent owned) scored two goals and had one assist for his fourth multipoint game of the season, and has nine shots on goal in his past two games. He has 14 points (six goals, eight assists) and four power-play points in 29 games. He is playing left wing on Toronto's first power-play unit with Marner, van Riemsdyk, forward Nazem Kadri and defenseman Morgan Rielly.

Video: TOR@PIT: Bozak pots second goal on a deflection

Despite their inconsistent play, Bozak ($3,500) and Marner ($5,000) are solid value options in DraftKings against the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday (7 p.m. ET; NHLN-US, TVA Sports, SN, NHL.TV).

Low ownership goalies have big nights

There were a number of strong performances from goaltenders Saturday, especially those who are largely available in Yahoo leagues and should be on fantasy owners' radars.

Goalie Antti Raanta made 33 saves in the Arizona Coyotes' 1-0 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. It was his first start since sustaining an upper-body injury against the San Jose Sharks on Nov. 22. Raanta (23 percent owned) is 4-4-1 with a 2.28 goals-against average and .930 save percentage in his past 10 starts. He is available in more than 70 percent of Yahoo leagues and is a great option for fantasy owners in need of a goaltender who will see the bulk of their team's starts going forward.

San Jose Sharks goalie Aaron Dell made 25 saves in a 5-0 win against the Ottawa Senators. He's 5-3-1 with a 1.72 GAA and .939 save percentage in 11 games (eight starts). Dell (28 percent owned) is available in the majority of Yahoo leagues and with the recent struggles of starter Martin Jones (94 percent), Dell could see an increase in playing time. He is a good short-term option for fantasy owners in need of picking up a goaltender for a spot start or as a value starter in DFS contests.

John Kreiser,No player on the New York Rangers has scored more goals since the start of last season than forward <span class=,2017-12-10T15:36:58Z,nhl-news,Facts and Figures: Grabner getting it done for Rangers,https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-key-stats-numbers-december-10/c-293878224,https://nhl.bamcontent.com/images/photos/293878238/1024x576/cut.jpg,sport,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"No player on the New York Rangers has scored more goals since the start of last season than forward Michael Grabner's 41 (Chris Kreider is next with 38, followed by Rick Nash with 30).

Grabner, who signed a two-year contract with the Rangers on July 1, 2016, has averaged 13:59 of ice time during his 105 games with New York (14:06 in 76 games last season, 13:44 in 29 games this season). And it's not as if he's been getting prime offensive time: Grabner has played 6:56 on the power play with the Rangers, including 53 seconds this season. Not surprisingly, he hasn't scored a power-play goal as a member of the Rangers. In fact, he hasn't scored on the man-advantage since 2012-13, when he played for the New York Islanders.

Grabner is in a seven-way tie for 21st in goals scored among all players since the start of last season; however, he's the only one who hasn't scored at least four power-play goals. He's tied with Tampa Bay Lightning forward Nikita Kucherov for third in even-strength goals with 40; Kucherov, whose 60 goals are the most of any player since the beginning of the 2016-17 season, has 20 on the power play.

There's one category where Grabner is unsurpassed: He's the runaway leader in empty-net goals since the start of 2016-17 with 10; no one else has more than six.

Islanders struggling on penalty kill

The Islanders' penalty killing has sprung some leaks.

New York's penalty killers allowed 14 goals in 69 opportunities (79.7 percent) through 22 games, good enough to help them go 13-7-2. But in the next seven games, the penalty kill has struggled badly.

The Islanders have been shorthanded 23 times in those seven games and allowed 11 goals (52.2 percent). That includes a stretch at the beginning of December when they allowed two power-play goals in four consecutive games. New York allowed another man-advantage goal (in two opportunities) in a 3-1 loss at the Boston Bruins on Saturday.

Despite their penalty-killing troubles, the Islanders went 3-3-1 in those seven games. And at 16-10-3 after 29 games, they're much improved from the same point last season, when they were 11-13-5. The Islanders hold the first wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference despite having played 11 home games, the fewest in the NHL.

Vegas Strong

One of the reasons the Vegas Golden Knights are second in the Pacific Division (19-9-1, 39 points) is their resilience.

Consider what's happened after the two times they've allowed more than six goals in a game. After an 8-2 road loss to the Edmonton Oilers on Nov. 14, Vegas ran off its second five-game winning streak (the first came after its only home loss, 6-3 to the Detroit Red Wings on Oct. 13). On Dec. 1, the Golden Knights allowed five goals in the third period of a 7-4 road loss to the Winnipeg Jets. They've won their next four games, including back-to-back road victories against the Nashville Predators on Friday and the Dallas Stars on Saturday.

The Golden Knights will get to try to extend that winning streak at home. They play their next five games (through Dec. 23) at T-Mobile Arena, where they are 11-2-0.

Subban vs. Subban

Malcolm Subban got the better of big brother P.K. Subban on Friday when they played against each other for the first time at any level of organized hockey. Malcolm made an NHL career-high 41 saves and didn't give up a goal on six shootout attempts to help the Golden Knights defeat P.K. and the Predators 4-3.

The Subbans are the ninth skater-goaltender pair of brothers in NHL history, but they'll have to face each other a lot more to catch the twosome who opposed each other most often. Hall of Fame goaltender Tiny Thompson played 553 NHL games and faced his brother Paul in 71 of them. No one has come close to the Thompsons; Phil and Tony Esposito are second at 43 games.

Video: VGK@NSH: Subban denies Josi's one-timer

Star struck

The Stars begin the week fourth in the Central Division at 16-13-1, a solid improvement from their 11-13-6 record after 30 games last season. But to do more than contend for a wild card berth, they'll have to do something they haven't been able to accomplish so far this season: defeat the teams ahead of them.

Six of the Stars' 13 losses, and none of their 16 victories, have come in games against the three teams ahead of them in the division. They have lost each of their two games against the Predators, St. Louis Blues and Jets -- and five of those six losses have been by three goals. In all, the Stars have been outscored 25-8 by the Predators, Blues and Jets.

Just what they needed

A visit from the Buffalo Sabres on Friday was what the Chicago Blackhawks needed to get back on the right track after losing five in a row. Chicago extended its winning streak against the Sabres to 12 games when defenseman Gustav Forsling scored with 4.9 seconds left in overtime for a 3-2 victory. The Sabres haven't defeated the Blackhawks since Dec. 11, 2009 (2-1 at Buffalo) and haven't won in Chicago since a 2-1 victory on Jan. 10, 2007.","vegas golden knights

It's the longest streak by the Kings since they won eight in a row from Feb. 7-24, 2015.

The Los Angeles Kings and St. Louis Blues became the first teams from the Western Conference to get their 20th wins of the season Saturday, joining the Tampa Bay Lightning, who did it on Dec. 7.

The Kings (20-8-3) reached the 20-win mark in their first 31 games for sixth time, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, and first time since 2015-16, when they started 20-9-2.

The Blues are 20-8-2 after a 6-1 win at the Detroit Red Wings. Six different players scored for the Blues, who reached the 20-win mark in their first 30 games for the fifth time, according to Elias, and first since 2014-15, when they also started 20-8-2.

Max effort

Another game, another win and another stellar goaltending performance for the Vegas Golden Knights.

One day after Malcolm Subban made 41 saves to defeat brother P.K. Subban and the Nashville Predators, Maxim Lagace made 36 saves in a 5-3 victory against the Dallas Stars on Saturday.

Lightning strike

Overtime had barely started, but Lightning forward Brayden Point's goal ended it in 36 seconds to give the NHL point leaders a 4-3 win against the Winnipeg Jets.

Hey P.K.! It's me, Garth!

How do you know you've hit it big in Nashville? Well, if Garth Brooks decides to wave directly to your camera during a live concert, that's a good indicator.

Zuucs does it all

Forward Mats Zuccarello saved the New York Rangers with two goals and an incredible play to prevent one in a 5-2 victory against the New Jersey Devils.

Jask Master

Dmitrij Jaskin's incredible goal from the Blues is one you are going to want to watch more than once, unless you happen to be Red Wings goalie Petr Mrazek.

On Saturday, they were back at practice knowing full well that though they came back to defeat the Buffalo Sabres 3-2 in overtime on Friday night and end a five-game losing streak, their game isn't where it needs to be.

""It was nice to get the win,"" defenseman Duncan Keith said Saturday. ""We did a lot of good things in the first period. But there's a lot of work to be done here and one game, it was a big win but we know there's a lot of work ahead and it won't get easier.

The Blackhawks struggling as much as they have through the first three months of the season is unusual, and their search for consistency continues entering their game against the Arizona Coyotes at United Center on Sunday (7 p.m. ET, WGN, FS-A, NHL.TV). Coach Joel Quenneville seemed more relieved than pleased by the result Friday and said Chicago has to be more opportunistic.

""Well, we had to win,"" Quenneville said after the game. ""I mean, it was a game that was OK. I just don't think it was good enough and then, OK, let's gain some excitement, some momentum off of one win, knowing we have to be better in all areas and in all aspects of the game. I still think around the net, whether it's looking for a better play, hanging around there, that's where we have to get hungrier, nastier and [have] more shot selection, too. Because if we get enough looks we can enhance it. And we need some finish.""

The Blackhawks (13-11-5) are tied for fifth place in the Central Division with the Minnesota Wild, 11 points behind the first-place St. Louis Blues. They can't keep responding late to pull points out of the fire.

""We're happy to get one here,"" said forward Tommy Wingels, whose shorthanded goal at 16:38 of the third period helped the Blackhawks force overtime Friday. ""Are we completely satisfied? No. We know we can be better in a lot of areas. But we can feel good about ourselves tonight, for sure.""

The last time the Blackhawks had this much early inconsistency was the 2010-11 season after NHL salary cap issues forced the Blackhawks to part with several key players from the 2010 Stanley Cup champions. They traded then-forward Dustin Byfuglien and, later, forward Andrew Ladd to the Atlanta Thrashers and couldn't afford to keep goaltender Antti Niemi, who signed with the San Jose Sharks. The Blackhawks ended November 2010 at 14-11-2 but started to gain traction once they changed starting goaltenders, with Corey Crawford replacing Marty Turco. They finished third in the Central with 97 points.

Since then, there has been a lot of steady regular-season success (not to mention two more championships, in 2013 and 2015); the Blackhawks have finished with at least 101 points in each 82-game season since 2011-12. By December, they are usually settling into a nice rhythm, not searching for it.

The Blackhawks have talked a lot about urgency but, like other aspects of their game, it hasn't shown up frequently enough. The same goes with full efforts, especially at the United Center, where the Blackhawks have won at least 24 games in each full season since 2007-08. They're 7-5-2 at home this season.

""You look at that game [against Buffalo], we had a lot of shot attempts but we didn't have a lot of grade A action around the net as we would've liked to,"" defenseman Connor Murphy said. ""We want to be a team that can play really well at home right from the drop of the puck and show we're a hard, almost impossible team to beat at home. When it comes down to that close of a game, we'd like to take over earlier and try to be known as a team getting a lot of home wins and playing a fuller game.""

It's been a while since the Blackhawks have been a work in progress in December. Richard Panik, who had 22 goals playing primarily on the Blackhawks' top line last season, has five goals, hasn't scored since Oct. 21 and is on the third line. Forward Brandon Saad has 10 goals this season, but six came in his first six games. Center Jonathan Toews has three goals in his past 10 games. The Blackhawks have two power-play goals in their past 24 opportunities.

Chicago is looking for everyone to be as steady as Crawford (12-7-2, 2.27 goals-against average, .930 save percentage), who got the win in his return Friday after missing three games with a lower-body injury. Points are always welcome. But to get back into the Central race, the Blackhawks have to find the consistency that's eluded them.","firstplace st louis blues

NASHVILLE -- It would be hard to imagine a much better start with a team than the one forward Kyle Turris has had since he was traded to the Nashville Predators on Nov. 5.

The Predators traded defenseman Samuel Girard, forward Vladislav Kamenev and a second-round pick in the 2018 NHL Draft to the Avalanche to acquire Turris.

Nashville is 10-2-2 since the Turris made his debut in a 5-4 shootout win against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Nov. 11.

But it hasn't just been Turris who has been hot since the trade. His linemates, Kevin Fiala and Craig Smith, have benefited as well. They were put together for that game in Pittsburgh, and In 14 games have combined for 37 points (15 goals, 22 assists).

Turris said he knew Smith and Fiala would be a good fit for him stylistically but didn't know how good it would be until they started playing together.

Video: NSH@DAL: Turris fires home blistering power-play goal

""I knew a little bit about them,"" Turris said. ""I knew they were obviously good players. [Smith] has been around the League for a while, and [Fiala] was a first-round draft pick. But playing with them now, you realize how good of players they are, how much speed they have and the skill level and how fast they play. It's a lot of fun.""

Smith, who had five points (four goals, one assist) in 14 games before Turris arrived, has 12 points (seven goals, five assists) since they were placed on the same line. Fiala also has 12 points (five goals, seven assists) on a line with Turris after having six assists in the 14 previous games. Playing with Turris and Smith has opened room for Fiala to shoot the puck.

""It's nice to play with both [Turris and Smith],"" Fiala said. ""I played with [Smith] last year already, and it's just great to play with him. So much speed. He creates so much offense with the speed, just a dog on a bone. And Turris is so good all over. Great passes, he can score. Both are very good, so I feel great.""

It was evident to the Predators the Turris line could be effective from their first game together. Smith and Turris combined for four points (two goals, two assists) and were generating scoring chances almost immediately.

""I think from the first game, I thought that we just had a lot of looks,"" Smith said. ""When you get some chances early, and especially when you score in the first game you're with each other, it creates a little energy and excitement. But it also works because I think we have similar playing types. We like to play with speed and we like to look for little plays.

""All three of us can shoot the puck so it's just about getting to the net and doing little things. But I think we support each other really well. I think when you do that you're able to keep the puck with possession and create little breakdowns with our speed and getting away from somebody.""

Video: MTL@NSH: Turris scores the go-ahead shootout goal

The Predators have had to rely on the Turris line even more during the past three games with top-line center Ryan Johansen day to day because of an upper-body injury.

Even though they have been productive, Turris, Smith and Fiala are learning each other's tendencies in different situations.

""We go out and we try to gain chemistry every day in practice and in games,"" Turris said. ""The more we play together, the more we kind of figure each other out. We're just trying to create and help the team, work give-and-gos and use our speed.""

Smith's 11 goals this season are one shy of his total in 78 games last season.

""I think he's been great in the [face-off] circle,"" Smith said of Turris. ""He's been able to win a lot of draws, which makes it easy on us. When you have the puck more things are going to happen in your favor. But other than that, I think that with his speed and his ability to make plays, he's a terrific passer, we've got to get open and definitely hitting us on the tape.""

Turris has seen his comfort level with the Predators grow with each practice or game. But he said he believes there are things with his understanding of the system, as well as chemistry with his linemates, that can be better.

""There's still little things, just the more reps you get, the more comfortable you get,"" he said. ""So yeah, I'm a lot more comfortable now than I was the first few days or first few games, but I feel like I can still get more and more comfortable.""","somebody video mtlnsh turris

EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE,The party will either pick up a seat in the Deep South — or have Roy Moore to campaign against in the midterms.,2017-12-10T06:51:56Z,politico,Why Democrats win even if they lose in Alabama,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/10/democrats-alabama-roy-moore-doug-jones-288631,https://static.politico.com/71/02/30071d3441b8afc70acb49629256/lede-doug-jones-1-gty-1160.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Democrats head into Tuesday’s Senate election in Alabama confident that they'll come out on top no matter who wins.

And many Republicans agree with them.

Story Continued Below

If Doug Jones prevails, Democrats expect it will further excite their base, bolster candidate recruitment and fuel fundraising heading into 2018, coming off their near-sweep of last month's elections. They will revel in picking up a Senate seat in the Deep South, especially in a state so central to President Donald Trump’s political rise and where he earlier backed the loser of the GOP primary. Practically, Republicans would have a 51-49 Senate majority, leaving them with a single vote to spare assuming Democrats stick together.

But the alternative won't make for bad politics, either, Democrats say.

If Roy Moore wins, they'll spend the next year yoking every Republican they can to the accused child predator and a president who welcomed him into the GOP fold. They'll be quick to remind everyone of all the other comments Moore has made against Muslims and gays and in favor of Vladimir Putin’s view of America as evil, as well as his rosy view of slave-era America.

“He’ll be the gift that keeps on giving for Democrats. If you’re running in 2018, Roy Moore’s going to be your new best friend. As a Republican, to think that you can win without the baggage of Roy Moore is pretty naive,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who decided to call it quits next year after polls showed him losing reelection and says he feels out of sync with his party, is the only Republican senator who said publicly he’d prefer Jones to Moore. Flake made a point of tweeting a photo of a check he sent to the Democrat.

Supporting Moore “already effects the [Republican National Committee] now trying to go out and raise money. A lot of people are saying, ‘Why in the world would I contribute to an organization that’s pushing an alleged pedophile and child molester?’ It’s a big problem,” Flake said.

Whether that will prove true over time is unclear. The Republican National Committee says it hasn’t seen that effect in the week since it sent $170,000 to the Alabama Republican Party to support Moore — a reversal, prompted by Trump, from its earlier decision to cut ties with the candidate.

But the issue is bigger than money, Flake said. He compared it to his 2012 campaign, when he constantly had to answer for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin arguing that “legitimate rape” rarely leads to pregnancy and Indiana hopeful Richard Mourdock saying a pregnancy caused by rape is “something God intended.”

“And those were just statements,” Flake said. “This is behavior.”

With most Republican senators distancing themselves from Moore or disavowing him entirely since the sexual allegations emerged, some GOP operatives argue that voters won’t hold them accountable for him if he wins. Anyway, goes that optimistic line of thought, Democrats’ linking down-ballot candidates with the sins of Trump didn’t stop a Republican rout in the Senate and beyond.

“It’s hard to say in the current political environment that guilt by association still resonates,” said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff and campaign manager for Mitch McConnell who remains an outside adviser to the Senate majority leader. But, he added, “it’s certainly not good for Republicans. The question is whether this resonates deeply into the core of what the Republican Party is.”

Despite the RNC’s flip-flop, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) says he’s holding firm, declaring that Moore will never get the committee’s support. He’s already on record saying Moore should be expelled from the chamber if he’s elected, as are a number of his colleagues.

That has conjured a fantasy scenario among Moore's GOP antagonists: That he’ll be forced out of the Senate, and that Republicans will get the credit. Then, on top of it, a special election likely will bring them a different kind of Republican for the seat.

Democrats are already batting around ideas on how they could force Republicans to vote on expelling Moore, putting them on record. And with Al Franken forced out last week before finishing the Ethics Committee process that Democrats had initially said they’d wait for, they now have an argument not to wait for the process to play out with Moore, and to say that conduct preceding a senator's arrival elected can be disqualifying.

“I think that it’s really important that your walk match your talk, and rhetoric is pretty cheap, so I think a lot of questions are going to be asked about that — continually,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a top Republican target in next year's election whose 2012 reelection campaign was widely seen as made possible by having Akin as her opponent.

McCaskill’s likely opponent, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, said Moore should step aside. But if Moore wins, McCaskill said, he’ll have to keep answering questions every day.

“This is hard for him just to sidestep. This is something you’ve got to confront,” she said.

“To have the Republican National Committee, the official arm of the Republican Party, actively supporting someone who has sexually assaulted young women and to set that aside by saying giving tax cuts to wealthy people is more important — there’s no way that every Republican won’t be held accountable for that,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of the Priorities USA super PAC and former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “They have set a new low for what is acceptable for the normal course of politics.”

The NRSC and DSCC declined comment.

Democrats are already using Moore to go after other Republicans. The Democratic Governors Association has issued news releases in Ohio attacking the leading GOP gubernatorial ticket for taking money from the same donor behind a pro-Moore super PAC, calling on the candidates “to return contributions from alleged child predator Roy Moore’s ‘chief financier.’”

And in Massachusetts, the DGA hit Gov. Charlie Baker for having a joint fundraising agreement with the RNC, or as they put it, the “Baker-backed RNC funding alleged child molester.”

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to ""disavow RNC support of accused child molester Roy Moore.”

“If they want to be the party of pedophiles, that’s fine, they can run on that,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).

In the meantime, most Senate Republicans are making a show of throwing up their hands, saying they’re powerless.

“I suggested that he should step aside. I still think that would have been the best outcome,” is how Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey put it in a typical response coming out of the GOP Conference. “But at this point it’s in the hands of the people of Alabama.”

Asked whether Moore would be a problem for Republicans, Toomey said, “I don’t think so.”

But asked the same question, Richard Shelby, the Republican who holds the other Alabama Senate seat, pointed out again that he didn’t vote for Moore, then said, “He’s unique.”

He ducked into an elevator on Wednesday as reporters asked him what he meant by that.

“You guys are smart,” he said. “You’ll figure it out.”

Holmes, for his part, summed up the Alabama race this way: “This is not just a lose-lose for the party,” he said, “it’s a lose-lose for the country.”","national republican senatorial committee

ALEX ISENSTADT,"Sources said the Alabama candidate, who's disappeared from the campaign trail, was planning to be out of state for the Army-Navy football game.",2017-12-10T19:18:47Z,politico,Did Roy Moore spend the final weekend of the campaign in Philly?,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/10/roy-moore-alabama-philadelphia-football-army-navy-288861,https://static.politico.com/ff/10/afc04bc64eaa985d2edc4f95df9f/lede-roy-moore-25-ap-1160.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"MOBILE, Ala. — In the last weekend of Alabama’s wild special Senate election, Doug Jones barnstormed the state with A-list Democrats in a bid to turn out black voters he desperately needs to win in the deep-red state.

Republican Roy Moore disappeared.

Story Continued Below

Confronting accusations that he harassed or molested teenage girls, Moore hasn’t held a public event since Tuesday, a decision that has perplexed some Republicans given the closeness of the race. Two Republicans briefed on Moore’s schedule before this weekend said he intended to spend Saturday in Philadelphia at the Army-Navy football game — a long-planned trip that the West Point grad had insisted he would still take this year despite the election.

One of those Republicans, who expressed concern about Moore’s absence, said that the planned trip was discussed with Moore’s campaign within the last few weeks and the candidate determined to go — case closed.

Moore’s campaign declined repeated requests to discuss his whereabouts and refused to say whether he had in fact gone to Philadelphia. His absence has baffled local and out of town reporters, some of whom staked out Moore’s church on Sunday morning only to be informed that he wouldn’t be attending.

The mystery surrounding Moore’s disappearance has added another layer of drama to a race that has been thrust into the spotlight amid a national upheaval surrounding sexual harassment. Once considered a shoo-in, Moore — damaged by allegations that he pursued teenagers when he was in his 30s — heads into Election Day with only a tenuous lead.

Senior Republicans, including some in the White House, said they were reviewing private polling showing Moore clinging to a low-single-digit lead. Other surveys, however, showed Moore with a more comfortable lead. Rick Shaftan, a GOP operative who is overseeing several pro-Moore outside groups, recently circulated to fellow Republicans poll results showing Moore up 8 percentage points.

With Moore nowhere to be seen in the final stretch, Jones raced to fill the void. During an appearance in Birmingham on Sunday, the Democrat highlighted his opponent’s disappearance.

“What kind of senator hides from his constituents?” the Democrat told reporters.

Jones has focused on turning out African-Americans, who comprise a substantial portion of the Democratic base. He spent the weekend campaigning with Democratic Party headliners including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.

But Democrats are still concerned that not enough black voters will cast ballots.

“Some people don’t understand: the opposite of justice is not injustice. It is inaction and indifference,” Booker told a crowd of roughly 200 at Alabama State University in Montgomery on Saturday night, reminding the audience that he has family roots in the state. “Bad people get elected when good people don’t vote.”

During the final days of the race, Jones, looking to capitalize on a wave of funding from liberals eager to see Moore defeated, has been intensifying his outreach to African-Americans, particularly in Birmingham and Montgomery. One pro-Jones group, BlackPAC, has funneled over $200,000 to spur black voters to the polls in the last five days. In heavily black Selma, where Jones appeared with Patrick and Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell on Saturday, the streets are lined with yard signs declaring, “VOTE OR DIE.”

Yet Jones must walk a tightrope. To win, he also needs more middle-of-the-road voters who have been turned off by Moore. Jones’s campaign has flooded Republican areas with mailers highlighting the criticism Moore has faced from longtime Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and first daughter Ivanka Trump. Looking to win over anti-Moore moderates, Jones has also recorded radio ads in which he proclaims his independence from either party.

And on Sunday, the Jones campaign pushed out a pair of online ads highlighting a Shelby appearance on CNN earlier in the day in which he said he didn’t vote for Moore.

Moore’s path to victory, by comparison, is more straightforward. A four-decade veteran of the Alabama political scene, he must simply ensure that enough staunch conservatives head to the polls. Looking to activate the Republican base, Moore has sent out mailers highlighting his endorsement from President Donald Trump and portraying Jones as a steadfast ally of Hillary Clinton.

Some pro-Moore groups are taking an even more pointed approach to energize conservatives. One Moore-aligned group, Restore Our Godly Heritage PAC, is airing commercials on nearly 60 stations around the state accusing Jones of “trying to steal the election with vile, racist ads on black radio.”

“Desperate to steal this Senate race, Jones and his race-hustling allies are trying to start a race war and it’s only going to get worse in the final weekend, with millions of dollars in street money to turn out the vote,” it adds.

Moore’s advisers have also been trying to stoke doubt about the sexual assault allegations. On Friday, his campaign held a press conference in Montgomery to highlight revelations that one of his accusers, Beverly Young Nelson, had added an inscription to a high school yearbook that she said Moore had signed for her.

""Alabama is an overwhelmingly Republican state,"" said Blake Harris, an Alabama-based GOP strategist. ""The question is whether the turmoil of the campaign keeps Republicans at home. That's the million-dollar question.""

While Moore heads into Tuesday as the favorite, he isn’t an overwhelming one. According to media buying figures obtained by POLITICO, Moore, who has been deserted by most of the GOP donor class, has been outspent on the TV airwaves by a nearly six-to-one margin.

“My prediction is he will win by a few points, but the allegations took a toll,” said Scott Beason, a former Alabama state senator and radio talk show host who recently interviewed Moore.

Some senior Republicans said Moore had little to gain, and potentially a lot to lose, by hitting the campaign trail. He would only be barraged by questions from reporters about the alleged sexual improprieties, they reasoned.

Moore is expected to surface before voters go to the polls. On Monday evening, he's scheduled to attend at a “Drain the Swamp” rally, joined by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.

Moore is also depending on President Donald Trump to make his case. The president has recorded a pro-Moore robo-call that's expected to be released on Monday.

The president has told those close to him that the race is close – and that he’s willing to do whatever is needed to pull the Alabama Republican over the finish line.","antimoore moderates jones

In fact, Obama’s team had a much more ambitious goal in mind. Vice President Joe Biden, the point person for the campus initiative, said at the end of his term that the administration was seeking “to fundamentally change the culture around sexual assault”—everywhere. New rules of sexual engagement between college students were written at the directive of the administration, but top Obama officials said they wanted these to be applied in the workplace and beyond. “You’re going to change the workplaces you work in,” Tina Tchen, director of the White House Council on Women and Girls, said at a 2016 event honoring campus sexual assault activists. “You’re going to raise your sons and daughters differently.”

They expected this transformation to take years. But with the daily toppling of powerful men who have committed sexual violations in Hollywood, the media, Congress and more, these changes have become seismic. The silenced have been given voice, and their testimony has resulted in the swift professional demise of perpetrators. Shocking descriptions of the behavior of powerful men have shown that it’s not universally understood that it’s unacceptable to display one’s genitals at work or to sexually abuse colleagues.

We now have an opportunity for profound reform, for women and men to join together to treat each other with dignity and respect. But as this unexpected revolution unfolds, we should also keep in mind the dangers of creating new injustices in the service of correcting old ones.

For that, it’s useful to look at how reforms played out on campus, where, unfortunately, many of the Obama administration’s good intentions went awry. Among the principles and polices that have become entrenched at schools—and are now spilling out into the wider world—are the beliefs that accusers are virtually always telling the truth; that the urgency to take action is more important than fair procedures; that we shouldn’t make distinctions between criminal acts and boorishness; and that predatory male behavior is ubiquitous. These beliefs have resulted in many campus cases in which the accused was treated with fundamental unfairness, spawning a legal subspecialty of suing schools on behalf of these young men. Examining what happened on campuses shows where the politics and social rules of interaction between the sexes might be headed—and how to avoid making the same mistakes on a larger scale.



***

Much of the Obama administration’s policy was at the initiative of Biden, for whom the issue of violence against women was career-defining. In 1994, as a senator, he oversaw the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, what he calls his “proudest legislative accomplishment.” When he became vice president, a new position was created under his aegis, White House adviser on violence against women, and he appointed Lynn Rosenthal, a national leader on domestic abuse, to fill it. The administration then decided to focus its efforts on what it said was an epidemic of sexual violence against female students by their male classmates. In 2011, the Department of Education sent a bombshell letter with the bland greeting, “Dear Colleague” to the country’s 4,600 institutions of higher education laying out new rules for how campuses were to root out and punish sexual assault.

It was the beginning of a concerted effort that radically remade how students could interact sexually, with severe penalties for violating increasingly stringent codes of conduct. Title IX is the federal law that prohibits discrimination in education on the basis of sex. Under the Obama pronouncements, college Title IX offices became vast bureaucracies, and students were encouraged to report any perceived violation. The Dear Colleague letter forbade “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.” To stay on the right side of federal regulators, many school codes expanded to turn even unwanted flirtation or sexual jokes between students into actionable offenses. New rules known as “affirmative consent” were put in place on many campuses, requiring that partners engaging in any sexual contact get explicit permission, preferably verbal, for each touch, each time. (Affirmative consent on campus has become law in California, Connecticut and New York.)

Rosenthal later explained why the administration put such focus on the sexual encounters of college students: “We felt it was a problem we could identify, evaluate, study and develop targeted interventions for,” she said at a seminar on sexual assault in January 2015, a few days after leaving the administration. “We also believed that what happens on our college campuses affects our nation. If we get this right on college campuses, we can influence an entire generation.”

Now, it’s not just an entire generation—it’s the entire nation. No matter whether an accusation is made about violations on campus, in the workplace or on the streets, it is essential that the accounts be taken seriously and the accusers be treated respectfully. But in the debate over campus sexual assault, believing accusers, especially female ones, has become a virtual article of faith. Many Democratic politicians have expressed an opinion similar to the one recently tweeted by California Senator Kamala Harris, regarding college campuses: “Survivors of sexual assault deserve to be believed, not blamed.” As Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen wrote in the New Yorker, wanting to examine the evidence before coming to a conclusion has come to mean being perceived on campus as being “biased in favor of perpetrators.”

In this national “just believe” the accuser moment, it’s important to remember that part of the power of the recent accusations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and so many others is that they are backed up by meticulous reporting that has provided contemporaneous corroboration and other evidence. Presented with these revelations, the accused themselves in many cases have provided confirmation by acknowledging at least some of their violations. A failed attempt by the right-wing group Project Veritas to persuade the Washington Post to publish the account of a fake accuser of U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore demonstrated the power of verifying before believing.

The complications of “just believe” are illustrated by the saga of Al Franken, who, on Thursday announced his upcoming resignation as a Democratic U.S. senator from Minnesota. In the past few weeks, he has been accused by several women of unwanted attempted kissing, or touching them on the buttocks or breast while having photographs taken with them. Franken started by issuing a series of tortured apologies, which neither acknowledged that he did the touching, nor categorically denied it. In responding to Leeann Tweeden, a fellow performer who says Franken aggressively kissed her during a rehearsal for a United Service Organizations show more than a decade ago, he said, “While I don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women’s experiences.” He added, “And the truth is, what people think of me in light of this is far less important than what people think of women who continue to come forward to tell their stories. They deserve to be heard, and believed.”

This made it sound as if either Franken knew he had done inappropriate things and wouldn’t admit it, or he believed he hadn’t but couldn’t say so—proclaiming his innocence would mean casting aspersions on his accusers’ truthfulness. Franken sounded as if he had taken last year’s mandatory Title IX training for freshman at the University of Southern California, where the first piece of advice given to USC students accused of sexual assault is to acknowledge the likelihood that they are guilty, as documented in an article in the conservative outlet Campus Reform: “Admit to yourself that even if you don’t remember the event, or don’t believe yourself capable of hurting someone, that it’s possible that you may have crossed a boundary.”

In the announcement of his resignation, Franken took a more defiant tone, backing off the admonition to believe his accusers’ version of events. He said he had “wanted to be respectful of that broader conversation, because all women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously,” but that his statements “gave some people the false impression that I was admitting to doing things that in fact I haven’t done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently.” So we are left knowing Franken was forced out by his Democratic colleagues, but not knowing exactly what to believe about the charges against him.

Ironically, Franken has been an ardent supporter of the Obama-era policies on campus sexual assault, policies that have required the creation of an industry to train, adjudicate and litigate Title IX matters. In August, four feminist Harvard Law professors—Gersen, Elizabeth Bartholet, Nancy Gertner and Janet Halley—released a paper, titled “Fairness for All,” writing that the procedures on campus today “are frequently so unfair as to be truly shocking.” For example, “some colleges and universities fail even to give students the complaint against them, or notice of the factual basis of the charges, the evidence gathered, or the identities of witnesses.”

The Obama administration Dear Colleague letter also required that “interim measures” be taken against the accused, before any adjudication. These can be harshly punitive, resulting in students being removed from certain classes, their movements on campus limited; sometimes they are even banned from school. The case of veteran New York public radio host Leonard Lopate illustrates what such “interim measures” look like in the workplace. On Wednesday, just before he was about to go on the air, Lopate was told he was being suspended because an investigation of “many” sexual harassment complaints against him was underway. He told the New York Times that he was “shocked” and “baffled” and that WNYC “didn’t even give me a clue” about the nature of the allegations. He added, “I am sure any honest investigation will completely clear me.” Indeed, both Lopate and the public are entitled to hear the results of a fair investigation. But surely before being publicly shamed, Lopate was entitled to know what the accusations against him were.

Statistics on the scale of the sexual assault problem on campuses nationally are controversial. And there are no good numbers about the breadth and nature of schools’ responses. But we do know that since the Dear Colleague letter was issued in 2011, more than 200 civil lawsuits have been filed by the accused, almost all males, against their universities, according to one advocacy group that tracks such suits. And these plaintiffs are getting an increasingly positive response from judges, who often express astonishment at the campus procedures that have been promulgated. In a scathing rebuke of today’s investigation and adjudication processes on campus, the National Center for Higher Education Risk Management, a leading Title IX consulting firm, released a white paper in April accusing many Title IX officers of “victim-favoring” and putting students’ “sexual decisions under a microscope.” The paper warned that unless campus processes were reformed, a backlash could “set back the entire consent movement.”

Democratic politicians in particular have acted with disdain for the rights of accused male students, and with disregard for ending their education and professional prospects. At a 2015 congressional hearing on campus sexual assault, Representative Jared Polis of Colorado suggested that anyone accused of sexual misconduct should be dismissed without any fact-finding at all. “If there are 10 people who have been accused, and under a reasonable likelihood standard maybe one or two did it, it seems better to get rid of all 10 people,” he said. “We’re not talking about depriving them of life or liberty. We’re talking about them being transferred to another university, for crying out loud.” (Polis was heavily criticized and walked back his remarks.)

Now, Franken and his colleagues seem to have absorbed at least some of that thinking. In his forced farewell, he noted that he was now forgoing his once-promised Senate Ethics Committee investigation: “I said at the outset that the ethics committee was the right venue for these allegations to be heard and investigated and evaluated on their merits. That I was prepared to cooperate fully and that I was confident in the outcome.” Senators had praised the idea of a proceeding that would provide, in the words of Senator Dick Durbin at the end of November, “due process. ” But last week, Durbin called for Franken’s resignation, along with 31 other Democratic senators. Now the public, and Franken’s soon-to-be former constituents, are left to draw their own conclusions.

In the past few weeks, a number of accused men have disappeared Soviet-style from public life, with the work of some—Louis C.K. and Garrison Keillor, for example—withdrawn from distribution. There has been discussion about whether everyone accused deserves a professional death penalty, or whether there should be a scale of punishment. After all, the violations run the gamut from multiple allegations of rape to unwanted touching. But in a statement on Facebook calling for Franken’s resignation, New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand came out against making such distinctions. “While it’s true that his behavior is not the same as the criminal conduct alleged against [Alabama Senate candidate] Roy Moore, or Harvey Weinstein, or President Trump, it is still unquestionably wrong,” she wrote. “We should not have to be explaining the gradations between sexual assault, harassment and unwelcome groping.”



In a New York Times op-ed, actress Amber Tamblyn wrote that making distinctions will mean the cultural change that is happening will stall and bad behavior will win out. So, she wrote, “The punishment for harassment is you disappear. The punishment for rape is you disappear. The punishment for masturbation in front of us is you disappear. The punishment for coercion is you disappear.” (She conceded that some men may be allowed to come back professionally after a period of contrition.)

This erasing of distinctions between the criminal and the loutish was a central feature of the campus initiatives of the Obama administration and led to many unjustified punishments. “Definitions of sexual wrongdoing on college campuses are now seriously overbroad,” the feminist Harvard Law professors wrote. “They are so broad as to put students engaged in behavior that is overwhelmingly common in the context of romantic relationships to be accused of sexual misconduct.”

What is considered a reportable offense on campus should give pause to those concerned about free speech and about the possibility of campus rules taking over the workplace. In his book, Twisting Title IX, Robert Shibley, executive director of the civil liberties group the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), writes about a 2014 case at the University of Oregon. A female sophomore called out a raunchy remark—“I hit it first!”—to a male and female couple who were outside her dorm room window making out. The couple didn’t appreciate her joke—the female yelled, “F--k you, bitch!” Then the couple came into the dorm to find the sophomore. She immediately apologized, but they reported her to the school’s Title IX office. The school investigated, and the sophomore faced potential suspension or expulsion. She contacted FIRE, which issued a news release about the case, and soon after the university dropped the proceedings. Do we really want to create workplace policies where any perceived wrong of a sexual nature leads to possibly career-ending sanctions?



***

President Donald Trump has boasted on tape that he sexually violated women and stands accused by more than a dozen of them of unwanted touching and kissing. So it seemed unlikely that his administration would want to draw attention to the issue of sexual assault at all. But Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced this fall that she was rescinding much of the Obama-era guidance on sexual assault, declaring that what her predecessors created was a “failed system” that brought justice to neither accuser nor accused and significantly deprived young men of their civil rights. The interim guidance she issued on campus investigations and tribunals called for investigations to be fair, impartial and free of bias; demanded that campus Title IX officials avoid sex stereotypes; and required that interim actions against male students and final punishments be proportionate and weigh depriving someone of an education. DeVos received rare and unexpected support from both mainstream and left-leaning outlets like the Washington Post, Slate, the New Yorker, the Chronicle of Higher Education and the Economist.

These measures would seem consistent with basic Democratic principles, such as defending the rights of the accused. But Democrats, including many with presidential ambitions, have taken the stance that they will vehemently resist any and all of DeVos’ efforts. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted, “What Betsy DeVos just did is repulsive.” Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said, “The Department of Education’s reckless action will make it harder for schools to hold violent perpetrators accountable.” Thirty-two Democratic senators, including Franken, wrote a letter to DeVos, rebuking her actions and asking for the reinstatement of the Obama guidance.

For years now, Democrats have described our nation’s campuses as places of overwhelming danger, where female students are at the mercy of predatory male classmates and callous administrators. Senator Patty Murray of Washington said in 2015, “Across our country right now, on some campuses there are some basic human rights being violated.” Last spring, in an interview in Teen Vogue, Biden said that after parents drop their daughters off at college, they aren’t talking about how they hope her academic or social life will go. He said, “The conversation that’s going on is, is she going to be safe?”

I have been reporting about campus sexual assault for several years; in September, the Atlantic published my series on the systematic deprivation of the rights of the accused and how this undermines the legitimacy of the very necessary fight against sexual assault. There is no good evidence that sociopathic predators beset campuses (a single study that made this assertion has been thoroughly debunked) or that callous administrators routinely abet such offenders. Nearly all of the many dozens of people I’ve interviewed—campus administrators, higher education experts, Department of Education civil rights investigators, professors, attorneys—describe the vast majority of cases as involving two students, usually in their first or second year, who are inexperienced at sex, and who frequently have been drinking, beginning an encounter that both parties often agree began consensually, and about which recollections later diverge.

But the descriptions of campuses as places of fear are moving into the workplace. Slate intern Lila Thulin recently wrote that as a student at Stanford, she had an experience largely free of the abuse Democrats describe. But now it seemed inevitable to her that something terrible was going to happen at the office: “I began to feel vulnerable, as if a clock somewhere was counting down the time until I, too, would be sexually harassed.” If young women come to presume that male colleagues who take an interest in their work actually have a malign motive, or if male bosses wanting to give opportunities to female subordinates worry about inviting them on work trips, everyone loses.

The movement to stop sexual harassment in the workplace will eventually move past this moment of shocking allegations against famous men, and should soon focus on the many nonfamous people in quotidian circumstances. But top news organizations are not likely to provide as much due diligence about those cases. No doubt many disputes will more resemble those on campus, in that the charges will be about ambiguous situations for which there is little evidence. This amazing moment has a chance to be truly transformative. But it could also go off track if all accusations are taken on faith, if due process is seen as an impediment rather than a requirement and an underpinning of justice, and if men and women grow wary of each other in the workplace. As Laura Kipnis, a feminist professor at Northwestern, writes in her book, Unwanted Advances, “I can think of no better way to subjugate women than to convince us that assault is around every corner.”

NANCY SCOLA,Libertarian billionaire Koch and left-leaning Silicon Valley are working together to advance the argument that innovation is most likely to flourish when government leaves it alone.,2017-12-10T07:00:51Z,politico,Tech's new D.C. partner: Charles Koch,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/10/charles-koch-tech-washington-287919,https://static.politico.com/91/c9/7dc9037a4c50ba972aa705156fda/koch-charles-gty-1160.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The tech industry has found a surprising new ally in its effort to shape public policy in Washington: the 82-year-old libertarian billionaire Charles Koch.

Two organizations founded by Koch, one an education-focused institute and the other a grant-making foundation, have spent the past year ramping up their efforts to shape public debate on tech policy topics like self-driving cars and the rights of online publishers.

Story Continued Below

And despite their ideological distance on issues like the Paris climate accord, the Koch groups and left-leaning Silicon Valley are working together to advance the argument that innovation is most likely to flourish when legislators and regulators leave it alone.

“We tend to think that there's a role for government, but it’s limited,” Jesse Blumenthal, who leads the Charles Koch Institute’s tech policy portfolio, said in an interview at the organization's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. He called technology a prime example of how people can see their quality of life improved, and their existences less constrained, when the free market is allowed to work.

The deep-pocketed Koch groups have the resources to help tech put on educational events, co-host conferences and fund academic research. But the alliance with Charles Koch also allows Silicon Valley to expand its contacts and influence in the age of Donald Trump — in a Washington that looks much different from what the tech executives who supported Hillary Clinton had expected after the 2016 election.

For an industry in need of new friends in D.C., amid threats of antitrust scrutiny and criticism of its role in enabling Russian election interference, the Kochs' deep ties to conservative circles may prove useful.

Evan Engstrom, executive director of the San Francisco-based startup advocacy group Engine, said he had a “huh?” reaction when a mutual friend introduced him to Blumenthal. But Engstrom’s group later partnered with the Charles Koch Institute on a June training session for congressional staffers on encryption.

“There are not a lot of philanthropic foundations working in the tech policy space, particularly on forward-thinking tech issues,” Engstrom said. ""I suspect we'll continue working together quite a bit.”

Others in tech, though, object to the new alliance.

“At some point the tech community needs to realize that our work has a moral dimension,” said Catherine Bracy, executive director of TechEquity Collaborative, a group advocating for fairness in the Bay Area economy. “Taking money from people who are dedicating their lives to undermining American democratic values, like openness and inclusion, goes against everything the internet is supposed to stand for.”

The Koch groups respond: “Understanding how people can be free to lead their best lives is foundational to what we do.""

The Koch brothers — Charles and 77-year-old David — have emerged in recent years as major funders on the right side of the political aisle, with an infrastructure that at its peak in 2015 rivaled that of the Republican National Committee. Charles is no fan of Trump — saying a vote for Trump or Clinton was like choosing between “cancer or heart attack"" — but the brothers have found common cause with Trump on one major issue of late: Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity has thrown its weight behind the tax code overhaul.

Silicon Valley, despite sharing some of the same libertarian impulses as the Kochs, votes overwhelmingly Democratic. The Koch groups, though, are finding their entry into the Washington tech arena largely welcomed by the industry's network of trade groups and policy organizations.

The Charles Koch Foundation, which says it's on track to give out $120 million in total grants this year, declines to break out its work in technology. But the groups’ new presence in Washington tech policy circles is becoming more visible.

In September, the Koch institute co-hosted a high-profile, daylong symposium with both the Newseum Institute and the Center for Democracy & Technology, a digital civil liberties group and Washington mainstay, focused on “creating a digital future where speech and democracy flourish.”

It's also helping to support the Technology Policy Institute, a D.C.-based think tank that drew a bipartisan crowd to a summit in Aspen, Colorado, this August and is in the early stages of funding academic research on the emerging field of artificial intelligence.

(Separately, POLITICO is a media partner with the Brookings Institution and the Charles Koch Institute in a series of debates about the United States’ changing role in the world, including one Monday in Las Vegas.)

The June event with Engine, co-hosted by the libertarian group TechFreedom, featured Ed Felten, an Obama White House deputy chief technology officer who's since returned to his professorship at Princeton University. Felten, over a lunch of fried chicken sandwiches, used a whiteboard to explain the “nuts and bolts” of encryption to a room packed with Capitol Hill staffers.

For the Charles Koch Institute, getting that passel of congressional aides educated on the basics of encryption is “worth a train ticket and Chick-fil-A,"" said Blumenthal.

The Koch Institute views encryption as providing the strong digital privacy protections that citizens need to live out free lives — in contrast to law enforcement advocates who say it allows terrorists and drug smugglers to hide on the internet. The group argues that self-driving cars might need some rules of the road but that regulators should take a light touch. And it believes that holding websites responsible for what users post on them — as Congress is poised to do, with bipartisan bills that target online sex trafficking ads — is one step toward “turning the platforms into checkpoints the government can use to censor speech.""

Those positions overlap nearly completely with what major tech firms like Apple, Google and Facebook have advanced.

For Democrats, the Koch brothers have long served as the epitome of everything wrong with the right. One party email pitch from 2011, for example, warned that Republicans were out-fundraising the left by “relying on right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers and secret special interest money.”

The tech industry, meanwhile, is far apart from Charles Koch on approaches to combating climate change. While Silicon Valley executives have condemned Trump's move to pull out of the Paris climate accord, Koch argues the U.S. shouldn't serve as the world’s “pigeon” in agreements to clamp down on greenhouse gas pollution.

But lately the tech sector has found itself on the same side as the Kochs on key issues in the Trump era. The billionaire brothers, for example, have opposed the president's travel ban, which restricts entry to the U.S. from eight countries, six of which are majority-Muslim — a policy the tech industry also opposes.

While the Koch groups are expanding their work in tech and innovation issues, they tend to stay away from telecom policy, because the field is too crowded with other groups, and intellectual property like patents and copyrights, because classical liberal thought on the issue is too divided, Blumenthal said.

Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, which co-hosted the September event at the Newseum with the Koch team, calls them “really great partners.” Working with the Koch group, he says, has helped his organization expand its scope.

He points to Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission, who addressed the Newseum event. Pai began his talk on free speech by saying of the event's three hosts, “I think it’s fair to say these three groups might not always agree on everything.”

""One of the reasons Chairman Pai, I think, spoke at our event was because CKI was able to reach out to him,” Calabrese said.

Beyond Washington, the Koch foundation says it's also increased support for academics considering tech policy, including a Texas A&M accounting professor launching a center for the study of innovation and a Georgia Tech public policy expert who works on issues related to internet governance.

“We have the luxury of having a longer time horizon than most organizations do,” said Blumenthal. “And the hope is, five or 10 years from now, when think tanks or whomever are looking for policy experts, you have these people who have been studying and thinking about these policy questions.”

The pattern of hosting events, giving grants to academics, and placing op-eds — Blumenthal and Engine’s Engstrom co-wrote one in August for The Hill — is part of a playbook the Koch groups have developed across other areas like foreign policy and what they call corporate cronyism.

Until now, tech was “the baby of the bunch,"" Blumenthal said.

Engstrom, the Engine executive director, said he hasn’t gotten any blowback from member companies or others in Silicon Valley over partnering with the Charles Koch-founded groups.

“I think people recognize that forward-thinking technologies can make strange bedfellows,” he said.","republican national committee charles is no fan of trump —

Insomniac Games, given custody of this character for a video game, seems to understand this. And the arc of their storytelling for Spider-Man isn’t about the opposition of super-powers. It’s setting the person who does good in a disguise against a man who pretends to it in public. Batman tackles lowlifes, freaks and acknowledged gangsters. Spider-Man takes down Norman Osborn, Wilson Fisk and, in this game, Martin Li.

That is a classic Marvel play, and this video above from PlayStation Experience 2017 sets it all up. Martin Li is a civilian benefactor. Moreover, Peter’s beloved Aunt May — a mainstay character going back to 1962 — volunteers for and admires his philanthropy. Something’s going to collide.

Okubo who was producer for Tekken 7 (also made by Bandai Namco) says that both development teams carry the same spirit of competitiveness and innovation to the task. However, Soulcalibur and Tekken diverge because the latter is focused more to hand-to-hand combat, where weapons play a larger role in Soulcalibur.

Weapons mean a great deal to a new feature: Reversal Edge, revealed during Soulcalibur 6’s announcement at The Game Awards on Thursday. Okubo said that the bullet-time combat moment is meant to replicate the cinematic feeling of dodging or parrying a weapon strike, folding that into a counter-attack. In such high-adrenaline moments, time slows for a skilled fighter and allows them to prepare their next move.

“That was the feeling we were trying to recreate, and it ended up becoming the edge reversal mechanic,” Okubo said.

Of course, the star of this video is the gameplay taking place in the background. Okubo expounds upon the graphical improvements Soulcalibur 6 will show over its predecessors, saying that lighting enhancements will be the key to the new game’s visuals.

Soulcalibur 6 is coming in 2018 to PlayStation 4, as well as Windows PC and Xbox One. On Friday, Bandai Namco said the game was going back to the series’ roots, both in its roster and the story the fighters will tell.","competitiveness

Owen S. Good,Socks or sweater? How about Scientology?,2017-12-10T16:32:35Z,polygon,Splatoon 2’s next Splatfest tackles crummy holiday gifts,https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/2017/12/10/16758350/splatoon-2-splatfest-socks-sweater-l-ron-hubbard-damn-you-fletch,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_u0hCGDExSoIDBDCT18k92WPA8=/0x52:1458x815/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9843615/DQidN_QVwAUB25z.jpg,gaming,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Splatfest, the time when we resolve polarizing social questions through the glorious gloppy group combat of Splatoon 2, has announced its next rivalry: Crappy holiday gifts.

It’s time for the next #Splatoon2 #Splatfest! Which bad holiday gift would you rather receive? A Sweater or Socks? Pick your poison and get splatting 12/15 at 9pm PT! pic.twitter.com/xr19VM7JAy — Nintendo Versus (@NintendoVS) December 8, 2017

Socks or sweaters will be the question when the next Splatfest kicks off on Friday, Dec. 15. Players will be asked to choose the one they would most like to receive and then fight in its name, as they did for fast food and toilet paper.

OK. Splatfest, we’re disappointed in you, because socks and sweaters, while boring, aren’t even close to the most dreaded gifts you could get over the holidays. They are, in fact:

Food: This is the ultimate give-up, especially because of its short lifespan. Food is consumed. A gift should be a reminder of someone’s thoughts of you. The only reminder I have of food is when I’m sitting on the commode, and Splatfest already tackled that question.

This is the ultimate give-up, especially because of its short lifespan. Food is consumed. A gift should be a reminder of someone’s thoughts of you. The only reminder I have of food is when I’m sitting on the commode, and Splatfest already tackled that question. Gift Certificates: Gift certificates suck because while the recipient can buy what they really want, the giver is admitting they have no idea of the recipient’s tastes. Plus, when is the last time you bought something that cost exactly $50? There’s always some arbitrage, or the gift recipient ends up spending more than a gift certificate’s value, which is why stores sell them. Straight cash is so much better. At Christmas in 1992, my brother and I, both home from college, simply exchanged $20 bills. Our mother was capital-A APPALLED. I think she made us go to Belk and buy a braided belt or something.

Books: Oh great, thank you for this two-week obligation to consume something about the subject for which I am most identifiable to you. (I have gotten so many baseball books over my lifetime.) Back to my brother again: The most malevolent holiday gift I ever received was in 1986. He knew that I would go to the Christmas tree and grope the presents to determine, in advance, whether they were shitty or not. Soft packages were usually clothes but could also be something else. But there was no mistaking the spine, cover and pages of a hardbacked book. So on Christmas morning 1986, I open my gift from my brother, which was the first thing laid under the tree and it could not have been more blatantly a book.

It was worse.

No, I am not making this up.

My father turns purple and tries to control his laughter by drinking from a glass of water. Mom is horrified and speechless. Both are waiting for me to croak an insincere thank-you for this piece of shit. My brother is playing it all flawlessly, looking in my eyes with a deadly, fold-four-aces poker face. “Um, thanks,” I mumble.

“Open it,” my brother says.

Inside, he has cut out, prison-contraband style, the center pages to conceal a cassette tape. It is — and again, I am not making this up — the soundtrack to Running Scared, the 1986 buddy-cop flick starring Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines. Now free to do so, Dad throws back his head and roars laughter. Mom holds hers in her hands, relieved that one son was not indoctrinating the other into Scientology. And hey, Michael McDonald sang the title song, and she really liked the Doobie Brothers.

So, books. That’s your ultimate bad holiday gift. But fine, choose from sweaters or socks if you like. You know the drill with Splatfest. Players vote on a poll in the Inkopolis square, then fight for that side in paint-splashed combat. Most matches won settles the question for all time.","nintendo versus nintendovs

Charlie Hall,The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game wants to catch the eye of Hearthstone fans,2017-12-09T17:30:02Z,polygon,Tabletop giant Fantasy Flight’s next project is a digital card game,https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/9/16753256/fantasy-flight-lord-of-the-rings-living-card-game-announcement-pc-release-date,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdOPxIEVkQSWVwMiHcTbs2S9XGI=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9838009/Gimli_banner_logo.png,gaming,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Fantasy Flight Interactive, the newest digital studio within Asmodee North America, has just announced its first game. Called The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game, it’s a single-player and cooperative multiplayer card game based on the successful Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, released in 2011.

Digital card games like Hearthstone or The Elder Scrolls: Legends all rely on random packs. Living card games, such as the classic Netrunner and Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, don’t. Instead, LCGs use a sort of expansion model, with known sets of cards available to be purchased for a fixed price. The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game will bring that model to PC for the first time.

The new studio is headed by veteran AAA developer Tim Gerritsen, who you may remember as the studio director at Irrational Games and the chief executive officer of Human Head Studios. Gerritsen not only brings 25 years’ worth of digital experience to the project, he’s also an avid collector of tabletop games.

“I’ve always been a big tabletop fan,” Gerritsen told Polygon. “When I got out of college I wanted to get into tabletop games, but that was right after the big TSR [the original publisher of Dungeons & Dragons] crash. The whole tabletop industry was reeling.

“So, I applied to video game companies instead,” he added. “I’ve had my fair amount of success, but I’ve always been an enormous tabletop gamer. It’s always been my original, first love.”

Gerritsen said that The Lord of the Rings LCG won’t simply be a rehash of the tabletop version. In FFI’s game, the part of Sauron will be played by an artificial intelligence instead of a random deck of cards. Additionally, the game has been streamlined slightly. Much of the bookkeeping is done in the background, and one of the game’s four statistics — armor — has been folded into a new type of card called attachments. But, by and large, it’s the same kind of experience as the original card game.

The Lord of the Rings LCG will enter a crowded space when it launches into early access next year. But it will be the only robust single-player experience, and will even feature a cooperative multiplayer mode just like the original tabletop game. Additional card packs will be available for purchase, either with an in-game currency called “valor” or via microtransactions. Individual cards, called “favors,” will also be available. But whatever packs of cards you’re buying, you’ll always know what’s inside.

Gerritsen is enjoying the work of transforming the popular card game to digital. He said that the transition from AAA video game development has been easy so far, especially given the amount of freedom to experiment that FFG has given him. The new company is even based in his home town of Madison, Wisconsin.

“I feel like Fantasy Flight really is the AAA of tabletop games,” Gerritsen said. “So in a lot of ways, this isn’t a whole lot different from what I’ve was doing before.”","interactiveasmodee

Layden said he’d seen “a lot of feedback about the title MediEvil” and considers the PlayStation game “a really important title in my personal journey and career.”

“We think Sir Daniel needs one more resurrection and this is the time to do it,” Layden said. “Serendipitously, I’d already had this one baking in the oven and then I saw all the pressure and thought this was a great time to talk about it.”

Layden showed a teaser trailer for the MediEvil remaster, which touted the game’s visual overhaul and 4K support. It’s not clear when MediEvil will be released for PS4.

The original version of the game was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment’s Cambridge Studio and released for PlayStation in 1998.","playstation

It also included an unexpected cameo: Mega Man.

Apparently the helpful palico buddies of Monster Hunter: World will be able to dress up like Mega Man, in chunky, 8-bit, cel-shaded style. Mega Man palicoes will be able to chug energy tanks and eat sausages, and players will be able to take part in monster hunts while also listening to classic Mega Man chiptunes.

Check out the trailer above for this slightly weird crossover. If it whets your appetite, Monster Hunter: World is having a beta test on PlayStation 4 this weekend, which is exclusive to PlayStation Plus subscribers.

Monster Hunter: World is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on Jan. 26, 2018. A Window PC version is also in the works. Next year will also be a big one for Mega Man; Capcom will release Mega Man 11 for consoles and PC late next year.","playstation

“There needs to be love there, some emotion connecting the user to the product,” Saint John told Recode Thursday at Code Commerce in New York City. “We’ve got to get people to be in love with the product.”

That won’t come as a campaign. “You have to show it,” Saint John, formerly the head of global consumer marketing for Apple Music and iTunes, said. “I don’t think you can in an ad.”

To Saint John, building a new brand image has to happen in the background through human resources, changing company culture and hiring women and people of color.

“There has to be more of us. Hire more women. The numbers matter in this particular case,” Saint John said. “There’s no magical Wizard of Oz that’s going to fix this for us.”

To the public, she wants to change the narrative to tell Uber’s other stories.

“It’s about storytelling, about upward mobility, movement,” she said. “I want to see drivers who’ve changed their lives because of this opportunity.”

To that end, Saint John plans to drive an Uber herself.

How would Saint John prevent issues like the #DeleteUber campaign, which hurt Uber’s business earlier this year when customers perceived the brand as taking advantage of a taxi strike?

“Sometimes it can be as simple as a statement. Uber has made statements about things that as a company and a country we don’t want to stand for.”

On diversity problems in Silicon Valley:

“This is not unique to Silicon Valley, it happens in grocery stores. I’ve been a black person all my life ... It is really bad in Silicon Valley and that’s where I work.”

On why she took a job at Uber for professional reasons:

“As a marketer, a brand person can rarely come in and literally put your stamp on it and say I did that ... It’s about the total structure of a brand.”

On why she took a job at Uber for personal reasons:

“If I can go into the situation like this — the tip of the spear for what is wrong — and we can fix that thing, I know for sure this will be all right. I want to hold up the mirror and say if this place can do it, so can everyplace else. I want to feel that. I don’t want to be in a situation where I feel like I can’t produce or can’t be my whole self because of prejudices or uncomfortable situations because of who I am.”

NBA boss Adam Silver has a solution: Make sports look more like video games.

Specifically, make them look like Twitch, Amazon’s platform for live gaming, which features a blizzard of live stats and a steady stream of chatter from gamers watching the event in real time.

“I think to a lot of older consumers, used to looking at sports, it might might look incredibly cluttered,” Silver said at the Code Commerce event in New York City. But it’s the kind of presentation that could appeal to younger viewers, he said.

Silver, whose league has made a point of embracing Twitter and other digital media outlets, argued that traditional TV broadcasts of NBA games and other pro sports have been essentially unchanged for the past 30 years. It’s “almost like a silent movie,” he said.

Right now, if Silver wants to see those kinds of changes in the U.S., he will have to hope that ESPN or Turner — which own most of the digital rights for his league — innovate in the way they present their games online.

But when those deals expire, he certainly expects Facebook, Amazon and other big tech companies to use innovation in the way they present his product as part of their offer. “The best sales pitch to us is how they’re going to find new ways to engage our fans in these telecasts,” he said.

To illustrate the tricky situation, Green noted that 43 percent of consumers admit “owning today feels like a burden.” Additionally, 77 percent of people say social media is the main source of inspiration for the products they buy.

Green knows what she’s talking about. Her firm has had uncanny success backing e-commerce startups. It was the lead backer in Dollar Shave Club, which sold to Unilever for $1 billion, and it invested in Jet.com, which Walmart acquired for $3.3 billion.

Green noted in her presentation that mall traffic is shrinking but consumers are still buying. These are confusing stats to navigate but Green thinks there’s plenty of hope, as evidenced by the $45 billion pop-up industry, in which retailers or brands create a temporary shopping experience.

She also pointed to in-store augmented and virtual reality displays, concierge-style services and made-to-order merchandise as ways that retailers can elevate ho-hum shopping to the level of an experience.

“I certainly don’t think we’re in the midst of a retail apocalypse,” Alber said. “I do not believe that and I do not believe that Amazon is killing retailers. I believe retailers’ bad service is killing retailers. And I think because of that you might not go to the malls as much as you used to.”

For that reason, Alber said Williams-Sonoma and its separate brands — including Pottery Barn and West Elm — are continuing to innovate around its service.

“We’re very focused on improving our customer service and not just in-store but also the delivery,” she said at Recode’s Code Commerce event in New York. “We just got done with a board meeting; we measured every single piece of our delivery to the customer [and] we’re now having customers rate at us at every single point.”

“Moving large-scale furniture is difficult, which is why it’s a huge differentiator,” she said. “If you can do something hard well that’s an advantage.”

Still, Alber said the companies have experimented with new digital experiences for e-commerce.

Pottery Barn has partnered with Google on an augmented reality app that lets consumers reimagine their home with furniture from the store.

“We want to lead on these things,” she said. “We knew the Tango phone, there’s not a lot of them out there. We’re great partners with Google [and] we do a lot of things with them. But we also did it because we wanted to be ready when it came on the Apple phone. The Tango phone had the depth perception that allowed this to happen.”

Now, the company has about 140,000 3-D models built for this AR/VR experience. However, Alber concedes that there are few Tango phones out there so the current application is used mostly in stores.

“What I’m focused on is putting our application on the Apple phone,” she said.

Recode Staff,His new book takes place in the Moon city of Artemis.,2017-12-10T07:59:01Z,recode,‘The Martian’ and ‘Artemis’ author Andy Weir on Recode Media: transcript,https://www.recode.net/2017/12/10/16754282/martian-author-andy-weir-book-artemis-movie-recode-media,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Km7EF43iZQY6BXsgCXpei3ycZ8=/0x145:1200x773/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9837349/andy_weir_artemis_moon_city_map_crown_publishing.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"On this episode of Recode Media with Peter Kafka, Peter turns the host mic over to Recode Managing Editor Edmund Lee, who talks with “The Martian” author Andy Weir. The two discuss “The Martian book and movie; Weir’s new book “Artemis”; and how a software engineer like Weir became a New York Times bestselling author.

You can read some of the highlights from the interview here, or listen to it in the audio player above. Below, we’ve provided a lightly edited complete transcript of their conversation.

Peter Kafka: This is Recode Media with Peter Kafka. That’s me. I am part of the Vox Media podcast network, but do not settle in and get used to my voice, because we are bringing in a new guest host today, Ed Lee, Recode’s managing editor. He talked to Andy Weir, who wrote “The Martian,” great book, great movie. He’s got a new book out called “Artemis.” Take it away, Ed.

Edmund Lee: Thanks, Peter. I’m here with Andy, the author of “Artemis.” Welcome, Andy.

Andy Weir: Hey, thanks for having me.

Cool, so you’re on a whirlwind tour right now with your new book.

Yeah, I am. I’m going all over the place.

All over the place. You’re from California, though, right?

Right. I live in Sunnyvale, which is just north of San Jose.

Right, so you are smack dab in the heart of Silicon Valley.

Oh, yeah.

Right. You started out, or you were until fairly recently, an engineer, a software engineer.

Yeah, I was a computer programmer for about 25 years there, and then I bumbled into success with “The Martian,” and that was the last time I did any honest work.

“The Martian,” we should back up a second, that’s your first published book? And it was turned into a hit movie starring Matt Damon.

Yeah.

I read the book, I’ve seen the movie. Congrats on the success.

Thank you.

My 12-year-old daughter’s a huge fan of both, by the way.

Excellent. I’m glad I could expose your child to a bunch of profanity.

Yeah, well, no. You didn’t expose her to anything that we didn’t already expose to her at home ourselves, my wife and I.

Fair enough.

Twelve-year-olds these days are pretty up to speed on the ...

Pretty educated, yeah.

Exactly, thanks to the internet. But of course, what was a big part of the success of “The Martian” and what made it so well reviewed is that it’s not so much science fiction ... I mean, it is a work of fiction, of course, it’s narrative, but it’s science real. In other words, you took the premise of, well, if you were to travel to Mars and someone had to be stuck there, how would that all work?

Yeah, I did my best to be as scientifically accurate as possible in “The Martian” and in “Artemis.”

Okay, let’s get to “Artemis.”

Sure.

It’s your second book. What’s it about?

Well, it takes place in a city on the Moon, humanity’s only city that’s not on Earth, and the main character is a woman who’s a small-time criminal, and she gets in way over her head.

It’s kind of a caper?

It is. For sure, it’s a heist story, whatever, crime novel, set on the moon.

But at the same time, as you did with “The Martian,” you delve really deeply into how would you live on the moon? How would habitats work? What’s it like to run or to fight in 1/6th earth’s gravity, right?

Right, yeah. I mean, I did kind of the deep dive into the science probably way further down the rabbit hole than I ever needed to go. Probably only about 1 percent of the stuff that I worked out for “Artemis” actually made it into the book, all the technical details of how it was produced, like how they built the city in the first place, and all that fun stuff.

Right, but you still have those notes somewhere?

Oh, absolutely.

Like you could publish that someday as sort of the background notes, if you really wanted to go deep into it.

My “Silmarillion” kind of ...

Exactly, exactly right.

Well, let’s hope “Artemis” is popular enough to warrant that. How about that?

There’s a good chance it will, based on what I’ve seen so far. I want to actually back up a second. As you pointed out, you were a software engineer. What kind of companies did you work for?

Well, I had a 25-year career. I go back as far as, well, I was one of the programmers on Warcraft II.

Wow, okay.

When I worked for Blizzard.

Wow.

Yep, that’s a long time ago. I also worked for AOL.

AOL, which is now, I think it’s called Oath, right, part of Verizon?

I don’t know, AOL, Time Warner, GE, Sheinhardt Wig Corporation, whatever.

Exactly, exactly.

I worked for AOL, and then I spent about half of my career working for startups in the mobile space, so apps for mobile phones, mobile devices, stuff like that.

You’re pretty steeped in Silicon Valley and internet Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, mobile revolution?

I suppose. It’s never been ... Well, I mean yes, I live in Silicon Valley, I grew up there, but also it’s just like I’m not a technophile. I’m not somebody who like, oh, I’ve just got to have the latest thing, the latest thing. I liked my job, I liked writing software, but it was never really this thing. It’s not like I liked talking about it at lunch, too.

Okay, so you wrote software by day and you wrote fiction by night. I’m just making that up.

I put on a mask to do that.

There you go, right.

Yeah.

But basically you, as a software engineer, you did spend your free time writing stories, writing short stories, and made up stories, etc., whatever it was?

Yeah, no, it really helps when you have no life and so you’ve got the time for those sorts of activities.

Well, clearly you’ve had a lot of time then. It has been very successful.

Thanks, man.

Well, so I did check out your personal website. I love the aesthetic, it feels like 1995-1996.

If that, yeah, it’s a very ghetto website. I made it myself, I’ll have you know. It’s just a white background with blue hyperlinks that are left-justified.

I love the blue hyperlinks. When I first started putting up webpages, that was with the gray background.

A gray? No, I can’t be putting the effort into changing the background color, I don’t have time for that.

What I found fascinating beyond just the success of “The Martian” is that you, as you pointed out, wrote stories on your own, you published them by yourself on your website for free, and that’s how “The Martian” actually started is you just had serials. You wrote it in installments and you posted it up on your webpage, is that right?

Yeah, that’s right. I was writing all sorts of stories. I had three different serials going, and random short stories that I would post. I just kind of wrote whatever I wanted, and “The Martian” was just one of the serials, but it was the one that the readers clearly liked the best, and so that helped encourage me to write it more than the others, yeah.

There’s all kinds of ways to skin a cat in terms of the publishing industry. This is the way you did it. When you were writing, though, did you ever think, “I should submit this”?

No, it never occurred to me. I had, earlier in life, in my 20’s, I had taken a three-year sabbatical off of work to try to break into writing. I wrote a book, it wasn’t “The Martian,” it didn’t get published, I couldn’t get an agent, couldn’t get any traction. Kind of the standard tale of woe that every writer has.

You hold onto your rejection letters, I’m sure, right?

For the people that were kind enough to bother sending me a rejection, yeah, and I couldn’t break in, so I figured I guess I either don’t have what it takes or I don’t know, but went back into the software industry.

This wasn’t a sad Charlie Brown music, hang your head situation; I like writing software, but I decided that writing would just be my hobby. By the time I was writing “The Martian,” it never occurred to me that it was publishable, and I really didn’t think it would have any mainstream appeal. I thought I was writing for this tiny little niche audience of 1 percenter nerds like myself who wanted all the numbers correct and the mathematical proofs in the text.

Well, the nerds are taking over the world, so clearly ...

Fair enough.

Yes, you’re writing for a bigger audience in that way.

The Geeks Shall Inherit The Earth.

Exactly right. They responded to “The Martian,” your installments, and said, “Hey, you should actually sell this as a Kindle book.” Was that the idea?

Well, not quite. Basically, people ... As you commented, my website leaves everything to be desired, and so I was getting emails from people saying like, “Hey, I loved ‘The Martian’ but I hate your website. Can you make an e-reader version that I can download and put on my e-reader?” So I did that, and then other people emailed and said like, “Hey, I’m glad there’s an e-reader version, but I don’t know how to download a thing from the internet and put it on my e-reader. Can you just post it to Amazon so I can just get it through their system?""

Right.

And so I figured out how to do that, and that’s how I ultimately kind of accidentally self-published, and that started ... Basically, you have to charge $1 minimum — well, actually 99 cents.

Right.

You have to charge that, so it’s sales, and then so it started working its way up the bestsellers in science fiction, and that got the attention of Crown Publishing, and it got me an agent, and a movie deal, and ...

And they published your book, and now you’re a movie guy and big-time author.

Right. I don’t know why everyone doesn’t just do this, it’s awesome.

Exactly, I mean come on, there you go.

I highly recommend it.

Okay, I’m curious of the mechanics of that. It was a free serial, and even when you ... I guess ultimately when you put it up as a Kindle, it had to be 99 cents just because there needed to be a transaction?

That’s the rules. Well, those are the rules that Amazon has.

Did you have to take it down off your personal website after that?

Not when I posted it to Kindle. But of course once Crown came in and had the rights, then I had to take it off my personal website and of course take it off of, take it down from Kindle, and then they put it back up as part of their release schedule.

Were you ever ... I mean, of course that’s like one of those sort of dream moments of a would-be author.

Yeah.

At the same time, I’m curious, were you ever concerned about, “Well, I kind of have this built-in audience here and I don’t want to upset them.” Was there ever ...

Oh, no. Oh, hell no. No, no, no.

Screw these guys, right?

No, not screw those guys. Those are my core readers. In fact, a lot of those guys turned around and bought, even though they’d already finished the story, they turned around and bought the $1 version on Kindle just because ... I would frequently get email from people saying like, “Hey, I want to donate, you know, you should have a donate button.”

Oh, right.

And I’m like, “I don’t need a donate button. I’m a computer programmer, I make a good salary, I’m fine,” and so a lot of my readers saw this as an avenue by which they could donate, they’re like, “Okay, I’ll buy a copy of the book.” So no, those core readers are almost certainly a big part of the reason why it initially started to get up in the ratings in Amazon and then kind of worked out from there. But no, it had been my dream my whole life to be a published author through a traditional publisher, so yeah, zero hesitation.

Of course, and that got you even more distribution beyond just Amazon.

Oh, yeah.

It’s interesting. I think what you’re describing in terms of your core community, how they want to support you, that seems to be sort of what’s going on in the internet in general lately in all kinds of ways. There’s Patreon, there’s Kickstarter, there’s all kinds of ways to give money to artists or people who you think should be supported in some way. To what degree do you see this as just the future of everything, the future of web-based publishing, or anything that wants to get off the ground?

I think it’s good on the small scale and it helps out people who are doing small-scale things, but if you want to talk about something that’s large, that’s scalable, you can’t ... I mean, you couldn’t have something like this for a large company that employs 50 people or something like that. You can do it for someone who’s like, “Hey, I make these cool sculptures,” or whatever, and people will be like, “Oh, make more sculptures.” You can do that. But with very, very few exceptions, I don’t think you can have an economy where people derive their income solely through donations.

You need the big infrastructure to work it out?

Well, not only that, but ultimately it has to be like, “Look, if I’m going to do this thing, I would need you to pay me, and I need that to be guaranteed. I can’t just do the thing and hope you give me money, because I’ve got kids to feed.”

And Amazon can do that, and Crown Publishing can do that, exactly, right.

Yeah, no, and the traditional publishing route ... What you really get out of traditional publishing that people often overlook is the tremendous publicity and marketing engine and placement at getting your book in all the bookstores and things like that. That’s a thing. I don’t know how to do that, I can’t do that myself. I mean yes, they create the physical copies of the book, but distribution, and still, again, publicity and marketing, they’re fantastic, Crown is fantastic at that, and I wouldn’t even know where to start.

There’s a stark difference between how you put “The Martian” together and how you put “Artemis” together. “Artemis” wasn’t a free serial on your website, it wasn’t eventually Kindle bound, it was destined for print.

Right.

There is an Audible version as well, apparently?

Yeah, simultaneous releasing. Everything came out November 14th. I’m not sure when this will be aired.

It should be soon after.

But yeah, simultaneous release with the lovely and talented Rosario Dawson.

She’s voicing the ...

Is the narrator of the audiobook, and she did a fantastic job.

You have all this new infrastructure behind you on your second book.

Yeah, it’s awesome.

There’s an anticipation of like, okay, when’s your next book, Andy? Doing it that way wholesale as opposed to in the serial installments when you did” The Martian,” what was the difference just in the ... How did it feel different in terms of how you put it together?

Well, there are a few major differences. One of them was ... Well, one thing that I really enjoyed about working on “The Martian” was that I would get lots of feedback every chapter, right, so I’d post a chapter online and I’d get like hundreds of emails from readers saying like, “Hey, that was awesome,” yeah.

What happens next and what’s going to happen with ...

Yeah, right, and that really helps motivate me. That’s like, it’s exciting to me, and it’s like yes, I’ve got an audience, it’s cool. For “Artemis,” I’m just, I was by myself. I would give chapters to my editor and my agent to give me feedback on them just to make sure I’m not going completely off the map, but it wasn’t as exciting, it wasn’t as much of a thrill ride to have people constantly telling me I’m awesome, giving me that glorious external validation that I crave, right?

But one good thing about it was that “Artemis” was a much more complicated story, and it was more difficult for me to write, and so I had to go back and make changes to things like seven chapters ago to keep things working correctly. It would have been very difficult to do that in a serial.

And we’ll take a break. Here’s Peter with a word from our sponsor.

[ad]

You go through a lot of things in “Artemis” in terms of the science, right?

Yeah.

Living in 1/6th gravity, in vacuum, and that sort of thing, but metallurgy, and chemistry, and ...

Welding.

Welding, exactly. So did that get in the way at some point or do you really feed off of having that kind of deep background in how this thing actually works?

Oh, I love doing the research, I just can’t get enough of it. In fact, usually I have to go like, “All right, that’s enough, you’ve gone far enough down the old rabbit hole.”

“Let’s get back to the story,” right?

I have to get back to ... Well, and I only ... I have to be really stingy with what I tell the reader. I’m like, okay, the reader doesn’t want to read a 20-page treatise on the FFC Cambridge Process and how to do anorthite reduction into its base elements. They don’t want that — or maybe one or two people do, but most of them don’t — so I have to just say like, “Okay, only tell them the scientific background on things that are plot relevant,” and sometimes that’s hard, because it took me a long time to write this book, it should take you a long time to read it. That’s sometimes the feeling.

I certainly noticed that in the parts of the book where you really started to dig deep into this stuff. It isn’t just a personal thing, it actually drives the plot, it actually creates the contours of what you can and cannot do in the storyline.

Right. I started by designing the whole ... I had designed the whole city and worked out all the science and technology for it before I made any characters or storyline. One of the reasons I did that was because I didn’t want to warp the reality such that it was convenient for the plot. I started by saying, “This is the most realistic way to make a city on the moon. The plot and characters have to fit within that.”

I’ve read before that a lot of your sci-fi inspirations — Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, I grew up with these authors as well, I think they’re brilliant. “The Foundation Series” is one of my favorites of all-time.

Sure, yeah.

But these are very out-there sci-fi, this is like ... This is very classic in a sense that — let’s skip past the mechanics of this for a second — you can travel in space, and they might get into weird mechanics about that, but for the most part it’s sort of decided this is happening. “The Martian,” “Artemis,” I can certainly see hints of all these kinds of things as inspiration, but you sort of forged your own idea of what sci-fi is.

I guess, yeah. I mean I like very scientifically accurate sci-fi. I want to not break the physical ... I don’t want to break the laws of physics. A lot of those juveniles, like things by Heinlein and Asimov and Clarke, didn’t violate any of those rules, they’re like, you have something like a ... what was it, the twin paradox, I think, was one of Heinlein’s?

Right.

And they’re traveling in a ship, but it can’t go faster than light. They’re traveling at relativistic speeds, and experiencing time dilation, and they do all that. Although actually at the end, they do figure out faster-than-light travel.

They do faster-than-light travel and time dilation is solved that way.

Yeah.

Yeah, I know, that’s always an issue with faster than light.

Right, well, and what was interesting is they had instant communication in that, that’s what the mental, the twins, but that people studying that instant communication in the book is how they figured out how to do faster-than-light travel. So there’s this one little violation of physics and then Heinlein had them explore it just like real scientists would, they’d be like, “Well, wait a minute.”

Right, and then they solved, yeah.

And then they solved it, yeah.

Exactly. No, I love that aspect of it as well. I guess what’s interesting about “Artemis” in particular, the feeling that I got a lot from the book is, I mean there is definitely sort of a cyberpunk kind of vibe to it.

Huh.

I don’t know how much of that was intentional or not, but in terms of ... I guess what I’m talking about is, you do all along the economics of what a society is like like that, but the economy of the future, or how machines, or man-made situations, like how that drives progress, which is a lot of what cyberpunk deals with. I guess it’s what academics call postmodernism. How conscious was that? Was that an influence in any way?

I mean, certainly I would never have described “Artemi”s as cyberpunk. Maybe we have different definitions. To me, cyberpunk means like implants and like stuff like that, and there’s none of that in “Artemis,” but ...

No, it’s very kind of clean, I guess, you’ve got Gizmos, you’ve got people with their devices, basically.

Yeah, I mean technology like we have now.

Right, but how much of that still drives the plot, and not just that, but through the economics of living in a situation like that?

Yeah, I honestly believe that economics drives pretty much everything in the world one way or another, and so that was the first thing I had to do was work out what is the economic foundation of a city on the moon, like why would you do it at all? You don’t get a city full of people moving somewhere without there being some economic reason, and in “Artemis” the answer is tourism. The price of getting to low earth orbit and by extension to the moon is low enough that middle-class people can afford like a once-in-a-lifetime vacation to the moon, and so Artemis is a remote tourist destination.

And I love that it’s not necessarily a big first-world nation that sets it up, it’s this really interesting, intricate way of getting into a smaller country. I won’t reveal necessarily here, but it’s worth taking a look at. I love the caper plot, I thought it was really interesting, it was compelling. It feels almost like it was tailor made for a feature film. Was that part of the impetus for that?

It wasn’t intentional. When I’m writing a book, I’m not going like ... I’m not trying to write it as a spec for a movie, I’m just writing a book. Although a lot of my influences are from cinema and television, and so probably I tend to think along those lines in terms of plot structure and stuff, so there may be some of that subconsciously, but I’m just trying to write a book here, not ...

You want a good story.

Yeah, I want a good story. I don’t want an elaborate movie pitch.

Well, so the film rights have been picked up for this book, right?

They have, yeah. Fox bought the film rights and they’ve attached Chris Miller and Phil Lord, the directing duo, to direct, and those two right now are kind of narrowing down the candidates for screenplay writer to do the adaptation.

How were you involved in “The Martian” filming? Were you around set at all?

My only job on that was to cash the check, and I did that really well.

Yeah, that’s not easy.

I had no authority or say. I had no responsibilities for “The Martian.” I also, I didn’t go to the set, because they shot it in Budapest and Jordan, and I’m afraid to fly.

I have heard that.

Yeah, now, and you’re wondering how I got from my home in Sunnyvale to here in New York City.

We’re in downtown Manhattan here, exactly.

Valium, lots of it.

There you go, that solves a lot of issues.

Yeah, well, and for the record, prescribed by a doctor and not just some guy on the street.

Also, I mean look, writers on a movie set, there isn’t much to do.

Yeah, no, it’s just ... Yeah, like priest on a honeymoon, it’s just ...

Well, so given all of that, how did you ... This is your baby, this is your project, they turn it into a film and it sort of goes out of your hands. I know this is not uncommon these days with big books like this. How did you feel about it? What was the experience like seeing it?

Oh, well, so I never had ... With “The Martian” I never had an opportunity ... Are we talking about “The Martian” or Artemis on this one?

Let’s start with “The Martian” first.

I never had an opportunity to feel nervous, because although I didn’t have any say in anything, Drew Goddard, who wrote the screenplay, chose to involve me, and so he was on the phone with me very frequently asking usually technical questions, and he’d send me revisions of the script to get my feedback and just to see what I thought. I saw that he’d done such an excellent job on the screenplay, I never got to the point where I had to be worried about anything, and then the execution was like flawless. I mean Ridley Scott, Matt Damon? It was unbelievably good.

It was a very well done film.

In “Artemis,” it’s like I’m not sure to what extent the eventual screenplay writer will choose to include me. Whoever they are, I’d be happy to be a resource for them, but other than that, I’d just say like, “Hey, I’d love to see the revisions as they go by.”

One thing that’s particularly interesting about “Artemis” is the female protagonist, right? First of all, it’s a female protagonist as opposed to a male protagonist, which is ... A lot of sci-fi is driven by male characters a lot of times, but also this character hails from Saudi Arabia, she’s not a white guy from Minnesota or something.

Yeah, so how did I end up doing this?

Yeah, how did you come to that?

Well, I didn’t sit down and go like, “I’m going to be inclusive.” That’s not how that worked out. What happened was my original plot — remember I said I designed the whole city before I came up with plots or character ideas — so the first plot that I outlined was completely different than what the book is now, and it had different main characters, different everything, and I had a need of kind of a likable smuggler character for two or three scenes, like this very, very tertiary character, and so that’s when I created Jazz.

Jazz is the main character, right?

I’m sorry. Yeah, Jazz, Jasmine Bashara is the main character. And I said, “Well, Artemis is a very international city.” It’s one of those things, it’s almost like the Old West, it’s like if you can afford to get here, you can live here. There’s no immigration rules or anything. And so I said, “Well, what’s a country I haven’t used yet? Oh, Saudi Arabia, and I’ll make her a woman, just why not?” And so that was really kind of the invention of Jazz, and I’m like, “All right, she’s this likable, probably smart ass, and that’s it.”

Well, anyway, unrelated to her, that story didn’t really work, the story that I’d come up with for it, I’m like, “Eh, this is not working, I don’t like it,” so I ditched that and I came up with a second, a different story idea to take place in the city. In that story, Jazz was more prominent, but still definitely a secondary character.

Oh, that’s interesting.

That story also didn’t really seem to work for me, but it was getting better, but I thought like, “Huh, Jazz is actually pretty interesting. So what if I wrote a crime story? What if I revolved it around this smuggler character who’s kind of funny and stuff like that? I think I could sink my teeth into that.” So that’s where I came up with what “Artemis” is, the version that you have before you.

The crime caper, right.

The crime caper. And by that time Jazz was so cemented in my mind as a Saudi woman that my imagination would have just rebelled if I’d tried to make her something I’m more familiar with, so I’m like, “Well, okay, I’m going to get right down in there too.” It’s a first-person narrative, you’re right there in her brain with her, and that’s, yeah.

So, you’re a white guy from California and the protagonist is a woman from Saudi Arabia. How did you make this leap?

Well, the cultural thing is easy, like her culture is Artemis, she’s ...

Displaced, right, it’s somewhere else.

Yeah.

It’s ... you can go, you’re made anew there, that’s sort of a lot of the premise of living on the moon.

Well, yeah, and also she’s lived on the moon since she was 6 years old, so she’s culturally ... Saudi culture is not a big part of her life. Her father is much more old country because he was an adult when he moved there, but she’s much more just the culture of Artemis itself. That was easy because I could make up that culture and ascribe those morals and beliefs to her, and so that’s no problem.

The biggest challenge, though, is ... Oh, and also in this future I just, there’s like, at least within Artemis there is like no sexism or racism for her to deal with.

It’s more a function of do you have money or do you not have money.

Right. And I presume ... Humans are humans, so there’s presumably sexism and racism within the city even in that era, but it’s not an issue during this story. The biggest challenge, the biggest deviance from my own brain is that this is a woman, and however equal men and women are intellectually, we still look at things differently, and so I had to, I gave it my best shot, and I gave the manuscript to every woman in my circle of trust who I could trust to not just throw it up on the Pirate Bay, right?

My editor’s a man, but his boss is a woman, and his assistant is a woman, and the copy editor was a woman, and when she was copy editing, I was saying like, “Please, also give me feedback on the believability of the female lines.” I gave a copy to my mom, I gave a copy to my girlfriend, people that I could trust to give me feedback on it and point out the parts where it’s like, “Eh, this is really how a guy would do things, not how a woman would do things.”

Oh, so they actually had some influence over how this all turned out?

Oh, for sure, and I made changes based on it, yeah.

Hold that thought, we’re going to take another break, and here’s Peter.

[ad]

Thanks, Peter, and we’re back. The success of “The Martian,” the success of both the film and the book, landed you other things. You are also a producer of a TV series for CBS about next-generation NASA astronauts, what was it called?

That was called “Mission Control.” We shot a pilot for it and unfortunately CBS decided not to pick it up for a series.

I like the idea behind it, but TV is like that, right, there’s all kinds of ...

That’s TV, yeah, it’s ...

That’s great that you even got a pilot going in the first place.

Yeah, and it was a really cool experience, too, to be there for a production.

But you were the writer on that, is that right?

I was one of the writers.

One of the writers.

Well, I was an executive producer, a series creator, and one of the writers in the writer’s room. I wrote a pilot and then we got a bunch of writers together to basically rewrite the pilot to make it more what the network wanted and so on. It’s a big complicated process, but I was there for the shooting, I mean, I was there for the production itself.

Writers for TV tend to have more power than they do on film.

The showrunners do, yeah.

Exactly, right, yeah.

I was not the showrunner, to be clear.

You’re not the showrunner, but that’s sort of like the track for a lot of these guys is they start out as writers or part of a writing room.

Kind of, yeah. In a movie the director is the dictator, in a TV show the showrunner is the dictator.

The showrunner. Is that something you feel like you want to do more of in the future, like the experience of writing for a TV serial?

I would, I would like to do that, because I like the infinite canvas of television. When I say TV, I’m including streaming services, Netflix, that sort of thing, just video entertainment. It’s awesome, because in a movie, if you’re writing a movie you’ve got 90 to 120 minutes to establish characters, establish a plot, have the conflict, have a resolution, and then an epilogue, and you’re done. But if it’s a TV show, even if it’s like a 10-episode Netflix show, you’ve got 10 hours to tell your story.

You can be really expansive, right?

Yeah, and you can go off in directions, you can follow up on secondary characters, you can get justice for Barb, and so on.

So there was a little bit of controversy around the casting of that show in particular. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think you had ...

Oh, on “Mission Control”?

Yes, for “Mission Control” I think you had written the ... The main characters were fairly diverse, but in the actual casting it didn’t turn out that way. Talk about that. What was that situation?

Well, the casting, basically it was a really rough pilot season. There were I think something like, without exaggeration, I think there were like 400 pilots made by various entities across, in the country, just in the U.S. You would think people have this vision of Hollywood of like, okay, the struggling actor, and the big production, stuff like that. The model has changed. All the rules have gone out the window now that there’s so many sources that create content, so you’ve got ...

It’s no longer just the networks. Now you’ve got like Netflix, Showtime, HBO, Hulu, you’ve got Amazon. Everybody is making original productions, so there’s a whole lot more demand for the performers than there ever was in the past, so now it’s no longer a buyer’s market, it’s a seller’s market. The performers are more ... It’s harder to get good performers than it is ... If you’re a name, if you’ve got a name, if you’re a known actor or actress, you will have probably ...

You are in so much demand now.

You’re in so much demand now, and so we tried to get people who were the right ethnicities for those roles, and they were just taken, like they had already signed onto other things, and also a lot of performers are just now ... Also, again, because it’s sort of a seller’s market now, they can do things like, they’ll say like, “Well, I’m interested in the show, but I’m not willing to do a 22-episode season, so I’m only willing to ...”

“I can’t commit for that,” right.

“I’m not willing ...” And it’s in their best interest, because a 22-episode season is like, that’s what you do all year, but if they say, “But if you’re willing to do a 10- or 12-episode season like the streamers do, then that frees up half of my time to go pursue movie gigs,” and so that works for them. But we have, CBS is like, “This has to be a 22-episode season,” and so we lost a lot of interest there. It was a very difficult and painful casting process, and we did get good performers, but we did not get the ethnicities that we were shooting for.

But you guys tried at first though?

We tried.

I think there were two main leads with an African-American male lead, was that the original idea as you had written it?

The original idea was, yeah, an African-American male lead, the character of Stevenson who was the commander of the space station was originally slated to be African-American, and the flight director who’s the person in charge of mission control was originally going to be a Latino-American woman.

I love it, a white guy from California loves to get into these ethnic ...

Well, I’m not trying to make, it’s not a ...

I can see that you’re not purposefully trying.

Yeah.

I think it just seems like it’s some natural thing that you’re coming up with.

I don’t know, I guess I just ... It’s weird, when I’m coming up with characters they just kind of form in my head and they are what they are, and then I can’t change it. My imagination really doesn’t want me to change it.

Actually, so let’s jump back a second to “Artemis” and potential filming of it. It’s a really cool protagonist main character. Are you concerned about how that might be cast?

Actually, no, it is very clear that the studio is not messing around on this one.

They want to hew it as closely as they can to what you’ve written?

They, absolutely, yeah, they’re ... and in fact even to the point of they’re saying like, “Well, you know ...” they may end up having to, well, what they call a discovery, in other words you’ll have to get a lead that isn’t as well known, and then get the star power in the other characters if necessary. But there’s been so much backlash now in Hollywood for whitewashing characters that I think they’re taking it very seriously, or at least in the case of “Artemis” what I’m hearing ... Bear in mind, I’m a complete outsider to this process.

Right.

But what I’m hearing is they are very seriously ... They’re not messing around, they really, really want to get someone who’s at least the right kind of complexion to play a Saudi lead. It doesn’t have to be someone from Saudi Arabia, but there is actually a large pool of talent that are about the right complexion. You’ve got like people who are Arabs or Persians, and then you’ve also got Bollywood, right, and that’s a big pool of performers, and then you’ve got South Americans also, like ...

There is potentially a lot you can get.

There’s a large pool of potential performers. The trickier part is actually finding an actor who’s — actress — who’s young enough to pass for Jazz, but at the same time has the gravitas and name recognition to draw people into the theaters. There’s a whole bunch of business decisions involved, of course.

That seems to be how a lot of ... Of course, how films get greenlit is you have to get a big star to attach, and then the money comes in.

That’s part of it, yeah.

Yeah, exactly, so that’s always a tough, there’s a catch-22.

But there’s lots of characters in “Artemis,” so maybe we could get big stars in the other roles.

In these other roles, right. No, that’s a good point. Okay, so towards the end of this I want to get now to the tough questions. When will humans live on the moon?

Well, I went ahead and made my prediction in the 2060s for the beginning of construction of Artemis. “Artemis” takes place in the 2080s, so I gave us about 50 years to get to the point where we’ve driven commercial space travel, the price is down far enough that there could be a legitimate tourist industry.

You’ve actually, it’s out there in the book, this is your prediction for how and if it could happen?

Yeah, it’s my prediction of what could happen, and I actually wrote a paper about the economics of the commercial space industry, where it could go if they end up being as efficient as the commercial airline industry, and that’s on Business Insider, so they ... I think it’s on www.BusinessInsider.com.

We’ll look that up. Well, so I mean there are a lot of private enterprises now working on this idea. There’s Elon Musk with SpaceX, and Jeff Bezos has Blue Origin. Is it going to be from one of these guys?

And some old-guard companies like Boeing are also not messing around on this, they’re working hard on it as well. Yeah, I think the best thing that can happen for commercial space travel is competition. My personal opinion is that I think NASA and, well, it’d be nice if all the space agencies did it, but I would like NASA to get completely out of the business of making boosters at all. I would like them to concentrate on space stations, spacecraft, manned missions, unmanned missions, whatever, but not the getting into orbit part, just the stuff that happens after it’s in orbit.

Because the getting into orbit part is solved, that we know how that works?

Well, it can be outsourced to companies based on bids, and then those companies would compete to have lower and lower prices, and that’s where you get the beginning of the technological development that eventually gets us to a commercial spaceflight industry that has appeal to the middle class.

And that’s what’s going to drive it.

Yeah.

If it’s something that’s ultimately affordable for the middle class, then you’d actually have an industry coming out of that.

Yeah, if you could go into space, if you could spend a few days in a space hotel for like $10,000 in modern-day money, a lot of people would do that, but that’s like out of the question right now.

That’s like a honeymoon vacation or something, or a ...

Well, I mean it’s out of the question right now to go into space for that much money; it costs tens of millions.

Right.

But if they drove it down to where middle-class people could afford it, then I believe you’d have that industry. As an example, I’ll say one of the greatest things in my opinion that has ever happened to the aeronautical industry is the vitriolic competition between Boeing and Airbus. Boeing and Airbus are two airline manufacturers, they’re in different countries, so that means they can’t screw with each other by just having lobbyists and trying to make policy that favors one or the other, they have to actually compete, and if you look at the advances in aircraft technology over the last 50 years, it’s phenomenal.

Because of this competition, whereas before there wasn’t as much?

Right. Now look at the advances in spacecraft technology in the last 50 years.

You’re from Silicon Valley, you grew up in Silicon Valley, you live there now, you’ve seen firsthand the power of someone like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, what Apple has wrought, Mark Zuckerberg. And a big part of “Artemis” is, as we talked about earlier, the economics of what it means to live on the moon and how that’s motivated, how it’s driven.

In the future, are we just going to be working for these guys in Silicon Valley? Are they basically just going to be taking over the world? You’ve been beneficiary of part of that infrastructure, or this emerging infrastructure, and space travel could come from Elon and/or Jeff, so what’s the future of that?

Well, I don’t buy into the idea that it would be a monopolistic ownership of space travel. Now, in this story, in “Artemis,” there is a single company that owns Artemis itself and they rent out space in it, but the companies that operate within Artemis are their own things. We’re in a big building here in Manhattan, some entity owns that, but all of the individual companies in here are their own entities renting space in the building, right? It’s the same concept.

In other words, if that’s going to work there will have to be competition?

Oh, yeah, absolutely. If you don’t have competition then you just don’t have advancement or development.

Before we wrap up, what’s next? What are you working on right now?

Well, right this moment I’m poking at ideas for, and I’ve written a little bit on it, for a sequel to “Artemis.”

Already? Wow.

Yeah, it’s actually a different main character than Jazz, so it takes place in the same setting, but it’s not a direct sequel, and I would love to do that. I would love to write lots of stories that take place there, but I’m not going to dive too deep into it until I see how well “Artemis” is received.

Is that something that ... It seems to make sense for, I don’t know, we talked earlier about TV as sort of an expansive medium. Could that be something that lands at like a Netflix or an Amazon Studios or something?

Well, Fox owns the film rights.

That’s right, of course.

So it would have to be Fox.

It would have to be Fox, all right.

If they wanted to, and actually the way things work, the movie side of a company and the TV side are usually very, very different entities, so it belongs to Fox Features, so it’s very unlikely it would end up being a TV show.

All right, so maybe another movie?

Maybe another movie, yes.

Okay.

Maybe a sequel of that, yeah.

Andy, thanks so much.

Recode Staff,“We know the paradox of a free market is that sometimes you have to intervene. You have to make sure that it’s not the law of the jungle but the laws of democracy that works.”,2017-12-09T07:59:01Z,recode,EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Recode Decode,https://www.recode.net/2017/12/9/16752750/european-union-eu-competition-commissioner-margrethe-vestager-recode-decode-lisbon-web-summit,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uvF3cMXGCYXSsnQhx0K3BwdRH0k=/0x263:4724x2736/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9836023/GettyImages_870997970.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"On this episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, the show goes to Lisbon, Portugal, for a live taping with European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The two discuss Vestager’s stand on American companies in Europe — especially Google and Facebook — and how U.S. and European regulations differ.

You can read some of the highlights here, or listen to the entire interview in the audio player below. We’ve also provided a lightly edited complete transcript of their conversation.

If you like this, be sure to subscribe to Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

Kara Swisher: Recode Radio presents Recode Decode coming to you from the Vox Media podcast network.

Hi, I’m Kara Swisher, executive editor of Recode. You may know me as a supporter of the right to be forgotten, although personally I know I am unforgettable, but in my spare time I talk tech and you’re listening to Recode Decode, a podcast about tech and media’s key players, big ideas, and how they’re changing the world we live in. You can find more episodes of Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Play Music, or wherever you listen to your podcasts, or just visit Recode.net/podcasts.

Today we’re going to play an interview I conducted at the 2017 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. I talked to European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, who you may have heard of on a previous episode of Recode Decode, but the last time we talked was before the 2016 U.S. presidential election and a lot has changed since then. Let’s take a listen.

All right, let’s get started because we have a very short time. So Margrethe, how fucked is Silicon Valley?

Margrethe Vestager: Well, I don’t like to generalize because everyone should have a fair chance of making it, also in Silicon Valley, but at least serious enough so that we found that a fine of 2.4 billion euros was the fine in the Google case that we just decided.

So talk about where it is now, because, you know, you’ve been out in the forefront talking to these companies about their power, about their influence. And right now in the United States, finally, in Congress, which has acted not at all and our government has not acted very much against these companies, they’re under a lot of, they’re under siege, they’re under pressure, especially about Russia investigations. Can you talk a little bit about why you first went for them? Because I think they don’t have a sense of their power, and now people are recognizing the potential impact of what they’ve done.

Well, our values are very simple. If you’re successful in the market, it should be because you have the best products. Then your customers like you, not because then you cut corners, or you get a tax break, or you don’t inform authorities about how things actually are. And this is the case of the Apple case of unpaid taxes, and the Google case of misusing a dominant position, or the Facebook fine of not giving sufficient information to authorities when assessing a case.

On top of sort of my day job as a commissioner of competition, I have this worry about what happens with our democracy. What happens with our way of being together?

Right.

Being social. And I think maybe sometimes the platform businesses, they underestimate the powers that they hold.

All right, let’s talk about that. Because right now these investigations, it’s pretty clear these platforms were used and abused by others, in this case Russia, and a lot of the indications point that it had an impact on the election. And of course it’s not just a U.S. issue, it’s a global issue, that these platforms have enormous influence over politics, society, culture, all kinds of things, including the coarsening of society.

One of the things I’ve always talked about is the fact that they’re not benign platforms, and they see themselves that way. They often do. Can you talk about the challenge of dealing with these big companies? Because largely they’ve been protected by the government in the U.S.

Well, for us the challenge is to develop the right tools, because I find that sort of the founders of the European Union, they saw rightly that we need fair competition to have a fair market.

Right.

And I think the motives are breaching competition, or they are as old as Adam and Eve. It’s about greed and fear, and when you combine that with power you have a very, very poisoned cocktail.

The motives, well, they go way back. But our challenge is to stay fast enough and to have the right tools, because this is a fast-moving area in our economy and we really need to make sure that all the businesses, all the coming-ups, all the entrepreneurs have a fair chance of making it in this market, to serve citizens in the role of customers.

Do you imagine, though, that the damage is done? Because so many of these companies right now, there’s consolidation in the United States, there’s ... these companies are getting more powerful. One of the things that you’ve been accused of by these companies is you’re trying to stifle innovation when in fact they’re getting more powerful than ever. So can you talk about that, that accusation that you’re trying to do protectionist, stifle innovation, not let them do what they do best?

But on the contrary, because I think everyone here would like to be the next Google. Who doesn’t want to build a success? But to think ...

Well, I don’t, but go ahead.

Well, you are a success already, so no need.

Yeah.

No, but the thing is, one thing is that when you grow, you shouldn’t deny others the chance to challenge you and you should never yourself say, “No one will challenge me so I don’t need to innovate anymore.” Competition is one of the most important drivers of innovation, because you have to stay in the race. You have to think of something new and if you don’t, well, of course you should leave the market.

And this is again where competitional enforcement comes in, to make sure that it actually happens.

So let’s talk about the state of play with these fines that you’ve put in. You’ve levied these fines, the one right now in the United States, there’s tax reform going on to bring back some of these ... such as the Apple taxes and the billions that are here. Can you talk about where they are at this point, what happens now?

Well, the thing is that even if you appeal a case after a Commission decision, you still have to pay the fine. Of course, if you win, then you get your money back. If you don’t, well, we redistribute the fine to member states of the European Union. So, the fines of the Google case, the guarantee has been paid. The fines of the Facebook case has been paid, and now we’re in the process of trying to recover the unpaid taxes of Apple.

But the Commission as such is also working on digitalized taxation as a matter of principle, because corporate taxation was maybe invented in a time where you had a physical footprint, you were present in the country. Now it can be present in the country by buying more server space back home, so we need to reinvent corporate taxation to make sure that every company pay their fair share of taxes.

[ad]

Well, talk a little about today’s news, about the International Committee of Investigative Journalists uncovered the Paradise papers. Which was essentially a scheme ... seems like a scheme, I’m trying to bring it down to a very simple level, it’s rich people trying to hide their wealth, essentially. Ultra rich people. Can you talk a little bit about how you look at something like these? Because there are several tech companies involved, there were investments that were hidden in shell companies, all kinds of things. So what were your thoughts today, because it’s a very complex and robust system to protect these companies and the people involved.

But that has to change.

So how does that happen?

You really have to change.

Talk about what you thought today when you saw those.

Well, I think, thanks to citizens, there’s been an enormous pressure because of the Lux leaks first and the Panama papers, and now with the Paradise papers, for legislation to change. For transparency, we would also like to have public country-by-country reporting, just report simple things. Do you have activity? Do you have employees? Do you make a profit? Do you pay your taxes? So that we know.

And second we would like also all the tax intermediaries, those who make this happen, to feel responsibility of enabling some businesses not to pay their taxes whether many, many, many, many businesses, they do pay their taxes.

Well, how do you do that? Because the scope of what’s going on here, this is a ... I’m assuming this is just the tip of an iceberg here of how they do protect their monies going forward. And one of the things, for example, with Facebook, I think all of us understood that there was Russian government money invested in Twitter and Facebook and other places. But now it’s very clearly outlined on how that works. How do you, with your powers, begin to change that?

I mean, you’re a very hopeful person but I’m not, and I’m assuming they’ll figure out ways to subvert all these things.

Oh yes, but people like me never get unemployed, unfortunately, but I think we can take steps forward to improve things.

Right.

I have a very strong tool in competitional enforcement: To do merger control, to look into cartels, misuse of dominant position, when member states hand out favors, for instance in terms of tax breaks. But even though that’s a strong tool, it cannot solve everything. We need regulation as well to say, “Well, these are sort of the basic rules of how the market should work,” and that’s in particular within taxation to make sure that our tax authorities have the right tools and they know the full history of a company. And that has actually been passed as legislation in the European Union within the last couple of years.

Right. That is counter to what’s going on in the United States, which obviously has an impact. We have tax reform going on that essentially gives backs to wealthy people, that’s what seems to be going on. We’ve got a president who, I’m not gonna go on about other things but wants to ... and by the way, I’m still sorry, Europe, I apologize for the United States of America.

But here’s the ... He wants to remove the regulation, that’s one of his most popular stances is the idea of removing regulation, removing oversight, removing any kind of strictures against these companies and their growth. How do you battle that when these companies are in the United States, they’re not being pulled back by the authorities in the United States?

But the thing is, I never feel more European than when I’m in the States. Because we’re different.

Right.

We have built up a market, a single market where you have a potential of 500 million customers, but it’s a market where you care. You care about environment, working conditions, human rights, taxes being paid, because we want a free market. But we know the paradox of a free market is that sometimes you have to intervene. You have to make sure that it’s not the law of the jungle but the laws of democracy that works.

Right.

Talk a little bit about where it’s going to, because one of the issues I’ve been writing about a lot or talking about a lot in podcasts and various things are what’s coming next. In a lot of ways, a lot of the things you’re talking about are technologies not of the past but of previous behaviors coming up — AI, robotics, automation, self-transportation, self-driving cars, the whole change of the transportation system. Infrastructure, new cities. Is that an area that you think you have to begin to look at strongly, because I literally was just in an Amazon warehouse in Kent, Washington, where there are people there and they’re working there but the robotics is both breathtaking and disturbing to see at the same time.

How do you look at those, and do you think, because they’re real advantages when you have a robot to boss around versus a person. So how do you look at that?

Two points. First of all, we take an interest in data because sometimes it’s nothing but sometimes it’s a real barrier to entry, which makes it very very difficult for others to come into this market. So we take care and look into mergers, if the amount of data will disable competition.

The second point is that I think some of these algorithms, they all have to go to law school before they are let out.

Okay, all right, meaning? What does that mean?

The thing is that ...

Because I don’t recommend anybody go to law school, but go ahead.

Well, I have a thing with lawyers as well.

Yeah, I get that, I get that.

Yes. But that being said, you cannot just say, “What happens in the black box stays in the black box.”

Well, they like it that way.

I know, but that’s not how things are.

They don’t know what’s going on in the black box, as it turns out, but.

And this is why you have to teach your algorithm what it can do and what it cannot do, because otherwise there is a risk that the algorithms will learn the tricks of, like, the old cartels. We just had a really old-school truck cartel of six companies colluding on prices and on environmental benefits in trucks and we had to fine them almost four billion euros for their behavior.

We don’t want algorithms to learn the tricks of the old cartels. We want them to play by the book, also, when they start playing by themselves.

So last thing, I wanna finish up very quickly and talk about where it goes from here and what are your biggest concerns. We were talking backstage, we both have teenagers. You’re not very ... surprisingly, I’m like a European regulator with strictness on my kids and you’re not. You like to let them do what they want, or what ...

Well, I don’t think that parents should be friends with their children on Facebook or Snapchat or whatever.

Really? How can you make them miserable then, how does that work?

Well, that’s a real-life competence and I’ll tell you, I muster it.

Yeah. So you, when you’re thinking about your kids and the impact on what they’re having, one of the things that’s being discussed in Silicon Valley, in Hollywood and everywhere else is around sexual harassment, around all kinds of issues, but it really boils down to an idea of diversity. And that’s another ... Do you feel like that’s your purview?

We were talking about this, that when you’re thinking about AI and various things, it seems like crap in, crap out, and if you have the same people designing these systems all the time, the same kind of people, do you think that’s something you, that’s part of your purview as a regulator?

Two things. First of all, I’ve seen my oldest daughter, she puts down her phone and she uses it less and less because she has a real life, in real life, and that I think is a very good thing. The new generation is doing all kinds of things, also, when it comes to the sustainability goals. They engage differently in their society. They are not just all on their screen, and I think that is a very, very good thing.

But we have to take our democracy back. We cannot leave it, neither to Facebook or Snapchat or anyone else, we have to take democracy back and renew it. Because society is about people and not about technology.

And going forward, what do you think your biggest focus is gonna ... The last question, what do you think your biggest focus for the next year is gonna be on, in a very short ...

Well, the next focus is going to be on whether we think that we can trust technology or not.

No, but go ahead.

Because this is the biggest wake-up call we have ever had. We’ve seen the potential, now we get the fear of what it will bring us. If we don’t relearn to trust technology, then we’ll never make any good of the potential.

Eric Johnson,"Jessica Rosenworcel, a member of the Federal Communications Commission, defends the endangered regulatory policy on the latest Too Embarrassed to Ask.",2017-12-08T11:30:02Z,recode,Why does net neutrality matter?,https://www.recode.net/2017/12/8/16745496/net-neutrality-jessica-rosenworcel-repeal-regulation-ajit-pai-fcc-kara-swisher-lauren-goode-podcast,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OicJOn45rzUKtqM2M2ZJXqNW-1E=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9826917/818845454.jpg.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Repealing net neutrality, a movement led by Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai and expected to pass on Dec. 14, gets people really worked up online: Millions wrote in to the FCC between April and August this year, although the exact number is in question.

So, why do people care so much about how the internet is regulated? And what would happen if the net neutrality rules on the chopping block — the ones implemented in 2015 by a Democratic-led FCC under President Obama — went away?

“Should this actually come to pass, I think we will find ourselves soon looking at litigation,” said FCC member Jessica Rosenworcel on the latest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask.

“I suspect that we’ll have lawyers around this country running to federal appellate courts to try to see if they can overturn these policies and even get a temporary injunction or stay before they go into effect,” she added. “It’s hard to predict with any kind of certainty what will happen, but I am convinced there will be litigation should this go forward.”

You can listen to the new podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.

Speaking with Kara Swisher and Lauren Goode, Rosenworcel — one of the two Democrats on the five-person commission, and an opponent of the repeal — said neutrality rules prevent internet service providers from blocking websites or slowing access to some sites to make others more appealing.

That fairness, she argued, is why the internet economy has grown so much since the first net neutrality rules were put in place under President George W. Bush in the mid-2000s.

“These were not policies that had a Democratic or a Republican tint to them,” Rosenworcel said. “They were just based on this idea that the internet should be open and you can go where you want and do what you want.”

On the new podcast, Rosenworcel rebutted Pai’s claim that consumers will still be treated fairly by their ISPs when they are required only to be transparent about how they “manage” web traffic.

“We all like transparency, so let’s be clear: I think transparency’s a good thing,” she said. “Transparency, in this case, means your broadband provider tells [consumers] about their traffic management practices. Theoretically, that’s a good thing. You put that out there and you’re told how your traffic is being treated.”

The issue, she went on to say, is that consumers will have no clear recourse if they don’t like what they get. A large number of them have only one choice of broadband internet provider.

“Ideally, in a competitive market, you pick up your service and you go elsewhere,” Rosenworcel said. “The great challenge for net neutrality right now is that, according to FCC data, more than half the households in this country don’t have a choice of broadband provider. Transparency only serves you well if your market is fully competitive.”

Recode Staff,His Decency Pledge is just a first step to improving online interactions.,2017-12-08T07:59:02Z,recode,Linked co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman on Recode Decode: transcript,https://www.recode.net/2017/12/8/16748572/linked-co-founder-greylock-partner-reid-hoffman-recode-decode,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VSZXtGtpmulUQ36umbTzngOYhCI=/0x0:4575x2395/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9830719/513213056.jpg.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"On this bonus episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, Kara interviewed Reid Hoffman onstage for the Never Is Now event in San Francisco. The two discussed, among other things, how social media biggies like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit could improve their platforms and whether augmented reality can trigger empathy.

Kara Swisher: Recode radio presents Recode Decode. Coming to you from the Box Media podcast network.

Hi I’m Kara Swisher, executive editor at Recode. You may know me as the author of a sequel to Reid Hoffman’s “Decency Pledge,” which I call, “Try Not to Be Awful for One Day Dudes Pledge.” But in my spare time, I talk tech and you’re listening to Recode Decode, a podcast about tech media’s key players, big ideas and how they’re changing the world we live in. You’ll find more episodes of Recode Decode on Apple podcasts, Spotify, Google Play Music, or wherever you listen to your podcasts, or just visit Recode.net/podcasts.

Today we’re going to play an interview I conducted with Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of Linkedin and general partner at Greylock partners. He also hosts his own podcast, Masters of Scale. We spoke at Never is Now, an event organized by the Anti-Defamation League in San Francisco in mid November. Let’s take a listen.

So, Reid and I have literally done this 426 times. It’s like a little act we have. We’re going to do it here for you today, and we’re going to hope that you get maximum information about what’s going on. It’s not like pro-wrestling, I’m not going to actually really hit him, but I’m going to hit him pretty hard on some issues because I’ve been really furious lately about Silicon Valley and its lack of responsibility, and its tarnishing of the American democratic system.

Reid Hoffman: And that’s the kind statement, by the way.

Yeah. What have they done? I think I want to start with that. You and I have talked about this. I’m not going to blame you, because Linkedin is not the font of social media cesspool these days.

Or ever, actually. Not just these days.

I do get a lot of emails but it is just vaguely annoying and not ruining of our American system. So let’s talk about that because you’re sort of seen as the, I don’t want to say Godfather, but you really are the one people who everybody likes in Silicon Valley, and nobody likes each other here. Let’s talk about the idea of what the responsibility of Silicon Valley is, in this system.

So, I’m going to break the answer into two parts. The first part is essentially a light plea for some understanding and compassion, which is, a bunch of these folks that built these systems didn’t actually think about hostile attack on them, didn’t actually think about what Russians might do in order to hack in, or trying in their own minds to figure out, okay, how are we as democratic and inclusive as possible, and how do we build the algorithms that way? I don’t think there is any malintent. I think that’s an important thing, and I know all the folks so I think I can assert that with some vigor.

However, as you begin to get big and as you begin to be having a very strong influence, your responsibility ... With power comes responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility.

The Spider-man ethos of Silicon Valley.

Actually, simple and super important. Even if you kind of say, lots of things contributed to negative results, Fox News, etc., etc. There was a contribution, both to the kind of malformed political system, the turbulence we’re having, and also of course one of our topics will be, kind of like internet trolls and hate speech. I think what’s important is to start thinking proactively about what to do. I think one could argue that they’re doing it a little too slowly, although as long as it’s resolute and you’re fixing it, I think that’s important.

I think ones of the things ... And so people are talking about, can AI technology help with this stuff? How can you do multi standards across multi countries? What is the degree to which you say you should block speech? And other things.

One thing I would say, as a way of thinking about, of adding to this discussion, is an idea that I’ve been kicking around for the last couple of months, has been, well, what if we could generate a way of saying, give us a report along with whatever reporting, diversity metrics, other kinds of things, about what you’re trying to do to promote positive speech. What’s the way that you’re trying to create these engagement loops? As opposed to saying, “Whatever’s engaging, that’s what we’re going to do.” So it’s a burning person falling out of a building, well, that’s what it’s all going to be. It’s like, no. How is it you’re actually creating positive engagement loops, and what are the things that you’re doing on that?

You’re appealing to people’s better natures.

Exactly.

Presumably.

It isn’t just block really terrible stuff, it’s promote good stuff.

I get that. I’ve see Mark’s 9,000-word essay on this issue but ... I stayed up all night reading it. Riveting. But let us begin. You said, “They didn’t mean to do it.” Let’s pick on Facebook because you were there in the early days, and we’ll get to the cesspool that is Twitter in a minute, but the early days, when this was happening they didn’t mean it. It was move fast ...

Move fast and break things.

Break things.

Yes.

I think they’ve broken a lot of things so let’s talk about that. What in that ethos didn’t anticipate any of human nature?

To be precise, the break things that Mark and other folks were referring to was wrong code, and that sort of things. Part of that’s because what they realized was the company that was going to be able to set the social network, social media standards in these things, was the one that moved fastest to grow, and it’s the nature of the society that we live in that has competition between companies, including between these tech companies, and so he was articulating a competitive strategy, which was how to win, and he turned out to be right.

He got to be the biggest.

To be the biggest, and turned out to be right.

But in those early days, was there discussion about where it could lead? Or just not at all?

To some degree in the early days with technologists, what it is is a little bit like a Roschach test. If you’re an optimist, you see optimism. If you’re a pessimist, you see pessimism, and so forth. Zuck’s an optimist, so the kinds of things in the early days ... Talking about Zuck, look, we can connect people and they can share experiences. They can get to know people, not just ... They can have a greater neighborhood than the neighborhood they’re in. Even revivify their neighborhood. All of these things bringing in the human fabric of life, of seeing other people as people. Seeing pictures of them on holiday, or with their kids and that kind of stuff, that was the stuff that was being discussed. It’s all the positive use cases.

So cat videos to the end. They just thought that. Cat videos.

Yeah, they thought cat videos. Great. Adds a little joy to your life, right?

But there was nobody in the room that went, “Ah, skinning a cat videos, maybe.”

No.

I’m saying, but who was in the room doing it? Was there anybody thinking that?

I think all of that has been retroactive. Has been, “Oh shit, people are putting up skinning cat videos, we should do something about that.” Right?

Right.

A little bit of the reason why I opened this set of commentary with a ... Look, it’s not unreasonable for them to have said, “Right now we’re just this little tiny startup.” Starting at colleges, going to locations, and we’re trying to weave our way to a place where companies like Google, and Yahoo at the time, were trying to build versions and then squash us, so when we’re trying to work through that we didn’t think this was the top priority.""

But it is equally important now that we say, “Now that you have a massive number of daily active users —” I don’t know what the current number is, 1.5 billion or something “— now that you have that, you now have responsibility and you need to lean into that and you need to figure out how do you help solve this problem.”

I think they ... You know, look, people are getting grumpy with them for not having done it more proactively sooner, but I think the fact that they are responding to it, I think that speaks to good character.

I want to get to the solutions of that but I want to talk a little bit more about the ethos, because I think it goes hand in glove with this free speech ... Two things, one, it’s a lack of diversity in Silicon Valley, so most of these people never had this happen to them, essentially, and they’re surprised by it.

Fair.

I’m like, my middle name is Bitch, so that’s what it is on social media, or something like that. So women understand it, marginalized groups understand it. People who are subject to anti-Semitic, everyone gets it except for the people designing it. That’s one part.

The second part is this free speech movement. I want you to talk about each of those. It’s like the lack of diversity, and then also this idea that people’s ... There is an ethos to Reddit, you always end up arguing with them that people should be able to say what they want. You argued this earlier, let’s start with that one. You were giving me a story backstage about being on the firing line.

So I was reflecting to Kara that my very first substantive television experience was being on William F. Buckley Junior’s “Firing Line,” which was a little strange, for those of you who remember it. The reason I was, was because they were hunting around for a technologist who would defend the thesis that the government can and should regulate some speech online. I said, “I’ll defend that position.”

Because one of the things I find people being fairy idiotic about is, they don’t realize we regulate speech all the time, and the simplest argument is truth in advertising. It’s like, no, we’re actually in fact ... Well, then you say, “We’re going to hold people accountable for falsities in advertising.” That’s a regulation of speech.

The real question is where do you set the line in order to have the broadest possible range for good, intellectual and political diversity in discussion, and when does that cross the line for bad things. Obviously, for example, speech that incites violence is always considered to be beyond the line too. This particular thing, everybody wanted to argue about regulating obscenity, which is obviously a tar pit and one that you should stay out of, but one does regulate speech.

I think one of the key things about this is to say, what are the ways that we can either increment what is in the current parlance, is terms of service. Because we’re all private businesses and you can say, “Look, if this is your business, you can take your business elsewhere.” That happens in hotels, happens in online stuff, and say, “Look ...” Articulate something around that. We are actually in fact ... This is the way that we articulate our opposition to hate speech and hatred. We enable discussion but we don’t enable, essentially, oppression or violence — of course, which they all do.

You might even change that somewhat, because you can when you’re huge, by country, or by country group. And then the other thing I think is important when you look at the stuff is to say ... One of the things I think, the underlying thing that causes some weird navigation for these companies, is the DMCA, because it’s super important when you say, we’re going to create a broad medium in which lots and lots of people can participate. Which I think can have some great positive outcomes, you need to shape it the right way, that you then not need to be easily sued for copyright material, and that you have a proactive obligation for stopping that copyright material, and that kind of thing.

That’s the reason they all adhere to the DMCA very strictly, to make that happen, but then you need to make sure the DMCA gives them some exceptions to say, we are doing some editorial along, for example, anti-hate speech reasons, or that kind of things, and we could do that.

[ad]

The ethos in the Valley, do you think it has shifted? When the recent Russian thing happened, I don’t think you were surprised, and neither am I because they let other things go. The bullying went on forever. The hate speech went on and on and on. The abuse of the platforms by the alt-right went on and on and on. Really abuse. Just backstage I was showing Jonathan, when you search for ADL on YouTube, you get white supremacist stuff the first 10, and you finally get Jonathan on MSNBC at No. 10. You don’t get anything about ADL, at all.

I know this sounds crazy, but YouTube is owned by this big company called Google that is really good at search.

Yes, so I hear.

The thing is, when we went over to Google, as you noticed and you search ADL, all the correct things came up. ADL, you didn’t even see it. I didn’t even find white supremacist stuff right away. Same thing, if you do it on Twitter, if you ADL, white supremacists. Facebook, I have not done that one yet but I’m just saying, this is this idea of not messing with what’s happening on the system.

I think that’s changing, hopefully changing fast and aggressively enough. I do think that your earlier thing, which is the fact that people who are building this, many of the people who argue that Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, haven’t actually experienced, like myself, I haven’t experienced the kind of things you can end up with in hate speech.

I’ll be doing that tonight to you.

I’m delighted. I think that’s part of it. Now, that’s again part of the reason why I was thinking about what are the kinds of things that’s important for the industry to do? I was like, well actually in fact to show a serious commitment should be the same kind of thing that we’re doing with diversity hiring, which is to say, “Here is our published report. Here’s the things that we’re saying. Here’s the things that we’re doing.”

I don’t think the things we’re doing should simply be, “We blocked X-thousand pieces of bad content.” Great, that’s fine, but also what are you doing proactively? What are you doing to try and create more compassion, more interaction, more mutual understanding? That kind of thing, and what are the things ... I actually think creating a simple report structure, that could then be part of how companies report is actually, I think, a good idea.

(applause) Yes, absolutely. One of the things with the numbers, though, I got something from Twitter, we blocked this many, 150,000 nests or whatever. I’m like, what’s the goal? So? And? What does that mean? Where does it fit in a system? When you get to that they’re like, “We blocked them.” I’m like, “Yeah, but what’s the goal?” Where’s the actual metrics that they want to get to, and what is the goal to do it.

When they do these things, like you had something, which I have a problem with you with, with the decency pledge. I think it’s a great, nice thing to do but it’s not ...

It’s a first step.

I know, but to say, “We should be decent,” shouldn’t be sort of ...

It’s the first step.

Right, I get it. Having to say ... It often becomes mutually exclusive where it’s, we want to promote happy speech, like good speech because it’s better for our businesses, it’s better for humanity, everything else. But it’s always mutually exclusive. Why not stop ... Let’s talk about solutions to stop this speech, and where do companies take a stand on it? They seem to not want to. To be the arbiters of certain things, and maybe they have to? Maybe it’s because they’re in charge, really.

Well, so part of the ... I think there’s a couple of parts to challenge. There’s easy hate speech that incited violence. That’s just a, you should have zero tolerance, completely get rid of it. Then there’s other kinds of hate speech that’s essentially derived at suppressing people, and that you should also get rid of. Now it gets blurrier because your ability to full track that, and distinguish between that and political discourse, and you know like when people post something about, here I’m trying to argue why hate speech is a problem and I’m posting this thing. Then you look at my thing and you’d block it as hate speed. All of that sort of stuff.

That was the reason I was going to kind of a report mechanism, as I agree with you, with a stated goal saying, these are the things we’re trying to get to, and this is how we’re iterating in that direction, is I think, a good tool to think about in this arena. I don’t think it’s possible to get to ... Human beings are messy. People do say insulting and inflammatory things, and that will happen within a democracy and politics and so forth.

However, what we should try to do is say ... And this is part of the reason I was saying these are private businesses, they can say, “Look if you want to do this kind of, for example, racist hate speech, do it somewhere else. You can create your own social network for that.”

Right, so why don’t they do that?

I think ...

Let me make a business argument, it’s like broken glass in the suburb. You cannot go on Twitter now and not feel bad immediately. It’s a really interesting thing. I think their business is — and that’s just reading Donald Trump’s tweets — but it’s really interesting because it ruins their business. It becomes a thing where you don’t feel good about it, you don’t feel ...

Do you think about it that way? I mean, you’re on a lot of these boards, they consult with you. Do they think about, wow, this could really hurt.

I’m not an insider in these conversations at Facebook or Twitter. I’m on neither board, just to be clear. I am friends with ...

You can include Reddit in there, and some of the others.

I’m not on the Reddit board. I know Steve and one of the things that’s interesting, Steve ... My own proponent in these areas tends to be real identity as part of the network platform, and Steve’s actually taught me a bunch about, well, there’s places that anonymity is useful in terms of being able to share certain types of experiences and so forth. Those are really precious, and that happens on Reddit.

I was like, that’s interesting. I’m such a proponent of real identities I’m kind of more of a student there. I think the short answer is now, what’s happening is people are realizing that the previous thing was, how do we establish this new medium, and now it’s, how do we make it healthy? I know enough of the folks that I know that they’re at least thinking about it intensely. Are they moving as fast as we’d like? Maybe not. I don’t know, I’m not an insider on it.

Let’s talk about making it healthy, because right now ... Let me ask you just a basic question. Do you believe social media deserves the kind of attacks they’re getting for amplifying the politics of destruction that are going on, the divisiveness in our country?

Yes, as part of a dynamic process for improving it.

I’m sorry. I don’t even understand three of those words.

Look, the short answer is, there’s lot of anti-technologist folks who go, “Look at that bad technology thing. That should be stopped.” That’s not my approach. I actually am enough of a techo-optimist that I think you can shape it in a way that’s very positive.

The reason I’m positive on the attacks is I want to create a dynamic of, “Oh shit, this is really important.” Okay, we’re going to do something about it. We’re going to start making product managers whose metrics are the right metrics in this. We’re going to start reporting it to the world, about what we’re thinking about doing, and what we’re doing, and who were are, and what we’re about. I think that will be the end result of the criticism.

Can they shift their business plans? Because their business plans are about engagement, really a lot of people have been talking about this issue of the addiction of it, the engagement of it. Someone called it the slot machine of attention. What causes attention, and pulling in is negative emotions essentially. That’s the best way to get people in.

Or designing. They have dozens and dozens of people at Facebook making you push a button. That kind of thing. Why did you push that button? Is there a rethinking, an overall rethinking of their business plans? Is it possible, given how much money they make from all this?

Well, I think that’s again something where you say, what are the other metrics that should be added in and maximized too? Obviously they will focus on maximizing attention metrics for advertising. By the way, this whole discourse was 30 years ago with television. It’s 40 ... you know Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, and so forth. It’s not new to say ...

It’s not the same. It’s amplified to the extreme at this point. Not everybody had a television network.

But we went to a highly televised society.

Right.

It also influenced political elections.

Absolutely.

The Kennedy-Nixon side. I don’t mean to state the parallels to discount the importance of working on it. I mean to simply say that we can figure out a good way of shifting the medium in real but kind of like a focused change because, among other things, we all get addicted in various weird ways, but our kids growing up learn the antibodies. Just like with television.

I don’t think it’s as big as an issue as the drum roll of “this is the end of the universe.” I do think that it’s an important thing to make modifications to.

Okay, so talk about some of those modifications, because then I want to talk about where technology’s going because AR and VR will also, could either amplify it, or make people more empathetic, and we’ll talk about that.

So talk about some of the solutions, in the here and now, what they should be doing. They’re under siege over the Russia stuff. They made their systems porous, they do still think of themselves as benign platforms. I know, Reid, you don’t think this but I hear it all the time: “We’re doing good for the world.” Same with AI: “It’s all good,” and they don’t have a sense of ... They’re sort of offended when you say, “Maybe you have some responsibility in this.” Or they feel hurt, mostly it’s hurt, sort of like delicate flower mentality.

You have to go ... Do you imagine they understand this now, and how do you get ... What are some of the solutions you think Facebook should do, Twitter should do, Reddit should do? I’m just picking three of the most important ones.

I think the reasons that they respond is because they go ... You hear the, “You terrible person, you’re responsible for this terrible, shitty election result.” And they go ...

Also, you’re billionaires.

Yes. Probably that, too.

Stop. Suck it up.

And that kind of attack does engage natural defensive reactions. If I was attacked that way, I’d have a defensive reaction in the first blush as well. I think the right way to actually have the conversation is to say, “Look, you’re super powerful. You have responsibilities for increasing the health of society. There are good things that you’re doing. We think that there is good to have people more in touch with extended family and friends, and what’s going on with their lives and so forth, and helps rebuild communities. We love all that stuff, it’s awesome. But you also need to figure out what to do to make sure the natural thing is to see the burning buildings and other negative influences.”

Let’s go to each of the platforms. What is the immediate thing they could do. Start with Facebook, two immediate things they could do?

Well, so like I’m not an insider.

You as a user of it.

Well, so I think ... Me, as a user, I don’t think they’re going to do this but I’d love it is I would actually love to see kind of like counterpoints, like here’s the bubble you’re in, and here is some highly published things that are outside the bubble. Just to get a chance to see them, because I’d love to see more building of bridges across diversity and discourse lines in various ways, and I’d like to see something along that line.

I’m not saying I wouldn’t see it. I just think it’s such an oddly shaped feature, I don’t know if that would be the thing to do. I think the kinds of things they will be doing is saying, “Okay, how do we ...”

Here’s something I think they could do, which is, okay, which are if you, say, vices in like, anger ... One of the things I say partially as a joke when I’m talking to MBA students is I invest in one or more of the seven deadly sins as part of investing into the consumer internet.

Your mom must be proud of that.

Yes, very. And so people ... Because people respond to negative emotions like this, and they respond to positive emotions like this, or some equivalent of that. Well, what I’d really love to see is, say, which positive emotions and which kinds of amplifications of that can we do to create an overall mix. Study the results of things we have and say, look, we’re just putting our pinky on the scale to rebalance towards more of those because that’s more of the society we want to be, that’s more of the community we want. That would be the kind of thing I would actually really like them to do.

All right, for me for Facebook is they get human editors and stop firing them because that would be good.

You know their volume is huge, right?

They could still. They didn’t have to fire all of them. That kind of thing, they have some human element to this because AI is certainly not going to ...

I get it. I get there are billions and billions of transactions. But you know, Linkedin agrees because we do actually have this.

Yes, exactly. You can do it. There’s a human element, that’s one thing that they really ... And to stop pretending they’re not a media company because they’re a media company no matter how you slice it.

[ad]

Twitter.

Harder.

Big long sigh. I don’t mean the business plan, because that’s a whole nother ball wax.

It would be funny if you could do something that started with the President’s account. Right? Since, as a role model, it may be ...

Don’t you wish Jack would wake up one morning and go, “You know what? He’s off.” Just, “I’m going to take the ...” It would be interesting.

Yes.

He’s crossed the line many times.

In my own politics I agree with that. It is important ...

It’s not politics. Actually, different people are judged at different levels, whether they get kicked off Twitter.

Maybe you should put a not safe for work brand on it, or something.

What would you do at Twitter? Two things.

Well, I think what I would do is ... I think the primary thing that’s interesting is that I think that Twitter is hacked a bunch to hack the media because journalists pay a lot more attention to Twitter. It’s the medium that most are actually on, and that’s part of the indirect thing, so I’d try to figure out how to essentially slow down or stop that.

I think I’d get much more aggressive on the anti-bot stuff, and try to figure out how to, for example, is there a possibility that the tech companies can work together on identifying bots and say, “We’re just going to get rid of those.”

Yep.

I think also, a version of what I was saying, which is say, look, the natural thing ... It’s the same thing on television, you show the fire, you show the explosion, you show the catastrophe because we as humans respond to that more en masse. You say, look, how do you promote more positive connection? How do you promote more, this was a great story of heroism, or of compassion ...

And then promote it further.

And promote it further, put balance on the scale.

Do you think they will do that? How do you assess? Because they’re influential even if they’re batshit crazy over there. They are!

I think that — this is in part an answer to your earlier questions, which is one of the reasons why I actually appreciate the criticism that the industry is getting, is I think with a continued presence of that criticism they will realize that their better outcome is to do that over time. They may be already doing it. Like I say, I’m not an insider in the conversations. I may be saying something that’s already in motion.

To me, immediately for Twitter, rules that are consistent. Not haphazard, that seem haphazard, and probably a full time CEO. I’m sorry, like you know what I mean. Someone who’s just dedicated, given the importance that it has or the attention that it gets. As to the journalists watching it, there are a lot more journalists but everybody’s on it. Every reaction to Charlottesville was on Twitter. Everybody reacted, which I think is interesting, and that when you have all these people paying attention, and they are, that it has an outsized responsibility,I think, in a lot of ways.

And the bots, I think you’re 100 percent right. That’s a really ... A friend of mine’s a New York Times reporter, was arguing with a bot. I finally had to text him and say, “You’re arguing with a bot. Stop! Stand down. It’s someone in Russia, I don’t know who it is, just stop. Who knows? Stop, don’t argue with the bot.”

Might be a cyborg.

So Reddit, last one, and then we’re going to talk about the future. They’ve done a lot more.

Sorry?

Seem to have done a lot more.

Yes. No, I think Steve is actually attentive to these issues because he’s actually one of the folks in the last few months that I’ve actually had the opportunity to sit down and talk with about it.

Steve Huffman, the CEO.

And like I said, I was initially like this anonymity thing, this has to go. He’s like, “No, no. It’s really important for these things.” I was like, “Okay. I hear you and I get it. Sharing experiences about I’m not out and I want to talk to other people about it, that can be super important things to have.”

It’s the general tool that I was thinking about the whole industry, so again it’s not a new thing for Reddit but again it’s kind of like, here is the report card about how we’re trying to make people more empathetic, more compassionate in terms of their own actions, and seeing diverse points of view and so forth. Here’s our report card, and here’s how we’re improving it as we go. That’s roughly what I’d like to see, and then that would probably be implemented in a different way. And Reddit could be, for example, the ratio of positive sentiment conversations to negative sentiment conversations. It could be something like that.

Yeah.

They would have to decide, themselves, this is who we are, this is what we’re about and these are the metrics that we’re tracking and we’re being open about these metrics so that you guys can help hold us accountable and then the discussion to are we having the right impact on society.

And presumably having a more diverse group of people working there might be nice.

Yes. And that’s part of the reason I look at every tech company of any size, should be doing the diversity measurements and reports, and saying look, this is our goals. This is what we’re improving.

One quick question on diversity, because it’s not why we’re here today but it does give you points of view. Why has it continued to be so astonishingly white straight guy? Boring white straight guy (laughter).

Boring with a capital B, yes.

Not you, you’re riveting.

Or riveted. So I think part of it, but I think that’s one of the reasons we have to put our hands on the balance and shift it, is what happens is, it starts with some ideas from people who are kind of naturally friends. They hire the people they know. They get in this world where, they’re in a tornado, which I call Blitz-scaling, and they tend to hire the people they know in terms of doing that. That tends to create ...

They just think, culture is everything, we don’t need this diversity. No, in actual fact you need to create that culture from the beginning. So I think that the kind of thing is to make sure that you have that kind of playbook. I think one of the good things that is coming about is most of the VCs that I know and like working with — not all of them, the species has some problems — are now asking, what are you doing in diversity in your company? What are you doing in diversity on your board?

Making it part of the investment?

Yes, and making it part of the conversation from the very beginning. It doesn’t mean that you have to, by month three you have to have done something, but it’s just like, for example, when we do partner recruiting, every time we talk about it, we talk about how are we expanding our diversity in terms of doing that. That’s always present in the conversation. I think that, at least, puts you on the right path.

Do you think it’s gotten to, you know a lot of ... I’ve always noticed, when we talk about these things, when there’s, especially boards, where you can get plenty of diverse choices. That they only use the word standards when it comes to women and people of color. Only.

Really?

Really, they don’t. The word standards never comes up in other ... You remember when Twitter had the same 10 white guys, the same names, they all had the same names, and they of course drove it right to a wall, I was like, where were the standards for these idiots? You know what I mean? It was interesting, but they often say, “Well, we have standards.” And stuff like that.

Oh, so they use standards as a disqualifier.

Yes. Yes.

Oh god.

Because we don’t want to just have a women. I’m like, why not?

Well look, it’s idiotsville to say there are not women to meet the standards.

Right, exactly. I think what’s interesting, and I’ve always said this, is that they think it’s a meritocracy, which they go on and on about. It’s a mirror-tocracy.

That’s a good line. I may borrow that line, if that’s okay.

You may borrow it.

Last thing we’re going to talk about is the future. So a lot of the technologies that are coming out really are immersive. If you think it’s already immersive, the stuff that’s coming out, especially around VR and AR — and I’m going to move those together because it think they kind of are together. Someone was talking about the idea of having someone in the alt-right watch what it’s like to be persecuted, or be on the other end of it, or a cop with a head thing on in the feelings of a poor black kid being pursued, something like that.

I don’t think you can VR your way into empathy in any way, and you can’t have the life experiences of that person so you can feel what it’s like all your life. Anyone who’s been persecuted in any way, do you imaging that there’s some ways we can use VR, AR, a lot of these new technologies coming, or until we get to the shot, where we have the empathy shot.

I think we can certainly do it within at least the corporate context because, for example, one of the things that — and I may not have this exactly right — but one of the examples I heard that was really interesting is part of the New York Police Department training, is in induction and early training, is they have two of the white officers kind of pushing two of the black officers up against the wall with guns. They say, “What’s that?” “That’s an arrest.” And then they reverse it, and they say, “It’s a robbery.” And they use that in order to try to explode these biases and really get a sense of understanding what’s going on. See people for who they are. Understand that you have biases that you need to correct against.

I could see, actually, both VR and AR being very helpful in that kind of induction. Like for example, say right now, it’s super important to the anti-sexual harassment training but you could imagine it’d be a whole lot better if it actually hit you more emotionally, and you understood what the other side felt like, because part of the problem with white, straight guys is they usually go, “Wow, is that insulting?” You’re like, “Yes!” And so getting ...

Sometimes every man in Silicon Valley feels like my 15-year-old son, but go ahead.

Well, we’re all trying to grow up at some point.

Yeah, hurry up.

Fair enough. But part of, I think, the hope in these technologies is more of a visceral experience because it’s once you begin to realize how it’s heard, how it actually feels like disrespect, how it actually feels like assault, and that’s actually how it feels, then that’s the beginning by which you can begin to understand that stuff. For me, my growing up from being a teenager was at Stanford. They had all kinds of classes on this, and I went to some of these classes and it was literally eye-opening. I was like, “Oh God, people do that?” And of course you hear it ...

That was actually important. I think we need that broader within society, and one of the things about technology is a lot of scale.

Is there any technology you think that could solve this problem? You’re the big technologist.

Solve, within the messiness of human beings, no. Improve, yes.

Unless AI and the machines take over and just kill us all, right?

I’m not sure that’s an improvement.

It could be.

I think, very unlikely. I think, part of the whole thing within AI in tech is to try and say, what is the design goal that’s essentially symbiotic? For example, one of the things that’s interesting when you beginning thinking about, for example, AI tutors or AI work, is how does that try to improve compassion and empathy? Because we know that’s our better selves, and that’s the thing we want the whole society to head towards.

What we need to do is, as we create these high-powered technologies, how in our interaction does it help us bring out our better selves. I think that should be part of the design goal for how we’re looking at it, and that’s part of the reason why I started thinking about, okay, what should the companies be reporting on? It was like, okay, how am I actually having a good theory of improving compassion and empathy, and how am I tracking against that, is actually in fact would be a good contribution.

All right. I wish Reid Hoffman was running every Silicon Valley company. Unfortunately he’s not. Thank you so much.

Reuters Editorial,"A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard at Jerusalem's main bus station on Sunday, police said, and violence flared near the U.S. Embassy in Beirut over U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.",2017-12-10T14:01:39Z,reuters,Palestinian stabs Israeli in Jerusalem; anti-Trump protest flares in Beirut,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/yrJKzQv2Pro/palestinian-stabs-israeli-in-jerusalem-anti-trump-protest-flares-in-beirut-idUSKBN1E40FQ,/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171210&t=2&i=1213460539&w=400&r=LYNXMPEDB90EW,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard at Jerusalem’s main bus station on Sunday, police said, and violence flared near the U.S. Embassy in Beirut over U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

Four days of street protests in the Palestinian territories over Trump’s announcement on Wednesday have largely died down, but his overturning of long-standing U.S. policy on Jerusalem -- a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians -- drew more Arab warnings of potential damage to prospects for Middle East peace.

“Our hope is that everything is calming down and that we are returning to a path of normal life without riots and without violence,” Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Army Radio.

But in Jerusalem, a security guard was in critical condition after a 24-year-old Palestinian man from the occupied West Bank stabbed him after approaching a metal detector at an entrance to the city’s central bus station, police said. The alleged assailant was taken into custody after a passer-by tackled him.

In public remarks on Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a frequent critic of Israel, called it an “invader state” and a “terror state”.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who spoke at a news conference in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after the two leaders met, fired back:

“I‘m not used to receiving lectures about morality from a leader who bombs Kurdish villages in his native Turkey, who jails journalists, helps Iran go around international sanctions and who helps terrorists, including in Gaza, kill innocent people,” Netanyahu said.

Macron told Netanyahu that he needed to make gestures to the Palestinians to break the impasse between the two sides.

“I asked Prime Minister Netanyahu to make some courageous gestures towards the Palestinians to get out of the current impasse,” Macron said, suggesting that a freeze of construction in settlements could be a first step.

Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory and say the status of the city should be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks. Israel says that all of Jerusalem is its capital, while Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.

The Trump administration has said it is still committed to reviving Palestinian-Israeli talks that collapsed in 2014, but jettisoning old policies is necessary to break the deadlock.

Washington says it has not taken a position on Jerusalem’s final status or borders, but it is sensible to recognize that any future peace deal will have Israel’s capital in the city.

The United States was “as committed to the peace process as we’ve ever been”, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday. Trump “didn’t talk about boundaries, he didn’t talk about borders... Because the final status of Jerusalem is between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It’s not for the Americans to decide.”

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will not meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during his visit to the region, Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki said on Saturday. The White House said on Sunday that decision was unfortunate and Pence looked forward to seeing Netanyahu and Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

“It’s unfortunate that the Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region,” said Jarrod Agen, a spokesman for Pence.

Netanyahu reacted to critics in a statement before talks with Macron, to be followed by a meeting with European foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.

“I hear (from Europe) voices of condemnation over President Trump’s historic announcement, but I have not heard any condemnation for the rocket firing against Israel that has come (after the announcement) and the awful incitement against us,” Netanyahu said.

DEMONSTRATIONS

In Beirut, Lebanese security forces fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters, some of them waving Palestinian flags, near the U.S. Embassy.

Demonstrators set fires in the street, torched U.S. and Israeli flags and threw projectiles towards security forces that had barricaded the main road to the complex.

In the Moroccan capital, Rabat, tens of thousands of protesters marched down the city’s main thoroughfare chanting slogans including, “The people want to liberate Palestine” and “Death to Israel, enemy of the people and provoker of wars.”

Waving Palestinian flags and holding up pictures of Jerusalem, they expressed anger at the “betrayal” by Arab governments perceived to have backed Trump’s move.

In the Indonesian capital Jakarta, thousands protested outside the U.S. embassy, many waving banners saying “Palestine is in our hearts”.

Maliki has said the Palestinians will be looking for a new peace talks broker instead of the United States and would seek a United Nations Security Council resolution over Trump’s decision.

Arab foreign ministers who met in Cairo on Saturday urged the United States to abandon its decision on Jerusalem and said the move would spur violence throughout the region.

Echoing that view, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, said the U.S. move “could throw a lifebuoy to terrorist and armed groups, which have begun to lose ground” in the Middle East.

GAZA TUNNEL

Along Israel’s tense frontier with the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military on Sunday destroyed what it described as a “significant” cross-border attack tunnel dug by the enclave’s dominant Islamist group, Hamas.

There was no immediate comment from Hamas on the demolition, which came as Palestinian factions tried to meet Sunday’s deadline for an Egyptian-mediated handover of Gaza by Hamas to Western-backed President Abbas after a decade’s schism.

Pre-dawn Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed two Palestinian gunmen after militants fired rockets from the area into Israel on Friday.","prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed alnahayan

Reuters Editorial,"The campaign of Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for U.S. senator in Alabama who has been accused of sexual misconduct, appealed on Sunday to President Donald Trump's supporters, saying a vote for Moore would be a vote for Trump's agenda.",2017-12-10T21:41:05Z,reuters,Roy Moore campaign casts Alabama race as referendum on Trump,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/aZ31vgjvYK0/roy-moore-campaign-casts-alabama-race-as-referendum-on-trump-idUSKBN1E40VH,/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171210&t=2&i=1213525701&w=400&r=LYNXMPEDB90SY,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The campaign of Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for U.S. senator in Alabama who has been accused of sexual misconduct, appealed on Sunday to President Donald Trump’s supporters, saying a vote for Moore would be a vote for Trump’s agenda.

In the final days before Tuesday’s special election, opinion polls show a tight race between Moore, a 70-year-old conservative Christian and former state judge, and Democrat Doug Jones, a 63-year-old former U.S. attorney.

Dean Young, chief political strategist for Moore, cast Jones as a liberal who would vote against Trump’s priorities such as building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and cutting taxes.

“If the people of Alabama vote for this liberal Democrat Doug Jones, they’re voting against the president who they put in office at the highest level,” Young told ABC’s “This Week.” “So it’s very important for Donald Trump. ... If they can beat him, they can beat his agenda, because Judge Moore stands with Donald Trump and his agenda.”

Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14.

Moore has denied the misconduct allegations and said they were a result of “dirty politics.” He has said that he never met any of the women involved. Reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations.

As the race tightens, Jones has cranked up his attacks on Moore over the allegations and made those charges central to his argument that Moore is an unsuitable choice.

The effort by the Moore campaign to align itself as closely as possible with Trump raises the stakes for the president in the Alabama race.

Trump has endorsed Moore and praised him on Friday at a rally in Pensacola, Florida, near the Alabama state line. The president’s support of Moore came despite efforts by other senior Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to distance themselves from Moore.

Alabama voters went strongly for Trump in last year’s presidential election, favoring him by 62 percent to 34 percent over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Washington has been roiled by sexual misconduct scandals, with accusations leading to the resignations last week of three members of Congress.

The growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men, from movie producer Harvey Weinstein to popular television personality Matt Lauer.

Republican leaders have said that if Moore wins, he could face an immediate investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee.

Republican Richard Shelby, the senior U.S. senator from Alabama, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he did not vote for Moore and instead backed a write-in candidate.

The editorial board of the AL.com website, which covers Alabama news, has endorsed Jones. In an editorial on Sunday, the website urged conservative voters in Alabama to follow Shelby’s lead and consider a write-in candidate if they did not want to vote for Jones.","senate ethics committee republican richard shelby

Reuters Editorial,"GGP Inc (GGP.N), one of the largest owners and operators of U.S. shopping centers, has rejected a $14.8 billion buyout offer from its biggest shareholder, Brookfield Property Partners LP BPY.N, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.",2017-12-10T22:22:32Z,reuters,Exclusive: U.S. mall owner GGP rejects Brookfield Property's $14.8 billion offer - sources,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/88AOTSWwnxU/exclusive-u-s-mall-owner-ggp-rejects-brookfield-propertys-14-8-billion-offer-sources-idUSKBN1E40VX,/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - GGP Inc (GGP.N), one of the largest owners and operators of U.S. shopping centers, has rejected a $14.8 billion buyout offer from its biggest shareholder, Brookfield Property Partners LP (BPY.O), people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

Brookfield Property made a $23-per-share cash and stock offer last month for the 66 percent of GGP it does not already own. A combination of Chicago-based GGP and Brookfield Property would create one of the world’s largest publicly traded property companies.

Brookfield Property is considering a new offer for GGP after a special committee of GGP’s board directors turned down its Nov. 11 offer as inadequate, and negotiations between the two companies are expected to continue, the sources said.

The companies do not plan to make a new announcement unless their negotiations lead to a deal or end unsuccessfully, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential.

GGP and Brookfield Property did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Brookfield Property’s efforts to buy GGP have come as mall owners across the United States are struggling as a result of many retailers losing out to e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

GGP shares ended trading at $23.43 on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of $22.2 billion. Its shares have underperformed the wider stock market this year because of the company’s exposure to troubled retailers such as Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O).

Brookfield Property Partners shares ended trading on Friday at $21.61, giving it a market capitalization of $15.2 billion.

Brookfield Property, an owner and operator of office and retail properties, said last month the deal would allow it to grow, transform or reposition GGP’s shopping centers.

The acquisition would create a company with an ownership interest in almost $100 billion real estate assets globally and annual net operating income of about $5 billion, according to Brookfield Property.

It is not the first time Brookfield Property’s attempt to buy out a real estate investment trust in which it already owns a big stake has been rejected. Last year, Rouse Properties Inc, another U.S. mall owner, rejected an offer by Brookfield Property, its largest shareholder, only to subsequently agree to a sweetened $2.8 billion offer.

Other GGP peers are also coming under pressure. Rival mall owner Macerich Co (MAC.N) currently is under pressure from activist hedge fund Third Point Management to explore options including a sale.

(Reuters) - A raging wildfire pushed toward a string of California coastal cities on Sunday, prompting new evacuations as crews fought to save homes in the face of gusty winds that have fueled blazes across the state for nearly a week.

Authorities ordered residents in parts of Carpinteria and Montecito to leave early on Sunday as the Thomas Fire edged closer to Santa Barbara, about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Los Angeles on the scenic central California coast.

The blaze, the worst of six major fires in Southern California in the last week and already the 10th largest on record in the state since 1932, has blackened 173,000 acres (62,726 hectares), destroyed hundreds of structures and left nearly 90,000 homes and businesses without power.

The combination of Santa Ana winds and rugged terrain in the mountains that run through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have hampered firefighting efforts, and officials said the Thomas Fire was only 15 percent contained on Sunday.

The National Weather Service said winds of up to 55 miles (88 km) per hour were expected on Sunday evening, up from gusts of 40 miles per hour on Saturday.

The fires burning across Southern California have forced the evacuation of some 200,000 people and destroyed nearly 800 structures.

Among them are residents of Montecito, one of the state’s wealthiest communities and home to such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey.

Emmy Leikin, an Emmy-winning songwriter who was ordered to evacuate her Montecito home at 9 a.m. on Sunday, said she fled with only her cell phone, medication, eyeglasses and a few apples.

Leikin, 74, said she doesn’t know the condition of her home and belongings but “none of that means anything when it is your safety.”

WORST IN A DECADE

The fires that began last Monday night collectively amounted to one of the worst conflagrations across Southern California in the last decade. They have, however, been far less deadly than the blazes in Northern California’s wine country in October that killed over 40.

In the last week, only one death has been reported, a 70-year-old woman who died Wednesday in a car accident as she attempted to flee the flames in Ventura County. Scores of horses have died, including at least 46 at a thoroughbred training facility in San Diego county.

Residents and firefighters alike have been alarmed by the speed with which the fires spread, reaching into the heart of cities like Ventura.

At the Ventura County Fairgrounds, evacuees slept in makeshift beds while rescued horses were sheltered in stables. Peggy Scissons, 78, arrived at the shelter with her dog last Wednesday, after residents of her mobile home park were forced to leave. She has not yet found out whether her home is standing.

“I don’t know what’s gonna happen next or whether I’ll be able to go home,” she said. “It would be one thing if I were 40 or 50, but I‘m 78. What the heck do I do?”

James Brown, 57, who retired from Washington State’s forestry service and has lived in Ventura for a year, was forced to leave his house along with his wife last week because both have breathing problems.

“We knew a fire was coming, but we didn’t know it would be this bad,” said Brown, who is in a wheelchair.

Some of the other fires, in San Diego and Los Angeles counties, have been largely controlled by the thousands of firefighters on the ground this week.

Both the Creek and Rye fires in Los Angeles County were 90 percent contained by Sunday morning, officials said, while the Skirball Fire in Los Angeles’ posh Bel Air neighborhood was 75 percent contained.

North of San Diego, the 4,100-acre (1,659 hectare) Lilac Fire was 60 percent contained by Sunday.Governor Jerry Brown, who surveyed the devastation in Ventura on Saturday, said the outbreak of December fires may be “the new normal” for the state, saying global warming was exacerbating drought conditions.","reutersmike eliasonsanta barbara county

Reuters Editorial,"U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Sunday she believes any woman who has felt violated or mistreated by a man has every right to speak up, even if it is President Donald Trump they are accusing.",2017-12-10T15:19:55Z,reuters,"Haley: Women accusers should be heard, even if Trump is target",http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/-Q2AigT_bGc/haley-women-accusers-should-be-heard-even-if-trump-is-target-idUSKBN1E40MH,/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171210&t=2&i=1213479897&w=400&r=LYNXMPEDB90IZ,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that any woman who has felt violated or mistreated by a man has every right to speak up, even if she is accusing President Donald Trump.

“Women who accuse anyone should be heard,” Haley said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “They should be heard, and they should be dealt with.”

Washington has been roiled by sexual misconduct scandals, with accusations leading to the resignations last week of three members of Congress.

The growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men, from movie producer Harvey Weinstein to popular television personality Matt Lauer.

Haley, discussing that cultural shift, applauded the women who have come forward: “I‘m proud of their strength. I‘m proud of their courage.”

Asked how people should assess the accusers of the president, Haley said, it was “the same thing.”

More than 10 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct before he was president. While filming a segment of the television program “Access Hollywood,” he talked about kissing and groping women.

Trump has denied the misconduct allegations, although he apologized for his comments, which he called “locker room” talk.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that sexual harassment allegations against Trump were addressed by the American people when they voted him into office in November 2016.

Asked whether Trump’s election settled the matter, Haley said: “That’s for the people to decide. I know that he was elected, but women should always feel comfortable coming forward, and we should all be willing to listen to them.”

On Tuesday, voters in the heavily Republican state of Alabama will cast their ballots in a race involving Republican Roy Moore, a former state judge, and Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney.

Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One woman said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14.

Reuters has not independently verified the accusations, which Moore, a conservative Christian, has denied.

Many Republicans, including Alabama’s senior U.S. senator, Richard Shelby, have distanced themselves from Moore. But Trump has endorsed him, saying he wants to see the Senate seat stay in Republicans’ hands.","reuterskevin lamarquefile photo trump

May, weakened after losing her Conservatives’ parliamentary majority at a June election, emerged triumphant last week after rescuing an agreement to move the negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union on to their second phase.

But the discussion of Britain’s trade relationship with the EU after Brexit contains many pitfalls and could widen differences among her top team of ministers, or cabinet, over how Britain should look after it leaves the bloc.

May will hold a cabinet meeting on Monday.

In a statement to parliament, May will take to task those who doubted that she could move the talks beyond the initial stage of agreeing terms on how much Britain should pay, citizens’ rights and the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

“I have always been clear that this was never going to be an easy process. It has required give and take for the UK and the EU to move forwards together. And that is what we have done,” she will say, according to extracts provided by her office.

”Of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

“But there is, I believe, a new sense of optimism now in the talks and I fully hope and expect that we will confirm the arrangements I have set out today in the European Council later this week.”

May will head to Brussels on Thursday for a summit meeting at which she expects the leaders of the other 27 EU states to approve an assessment by negotiators that the sides have made “sufficient progress” to move on to phase two.

TROUBLES AHEAD

The deal to launch further talks looked in jeopardy a week ago when May was forced to abandon a choreographed meeting in Brussels intended to seal the deal after her allies in Northern Ireland expressed fears she was proposing a special status for the region -- out of sync with the rest of the United Kingdom.

After days of diplomacy, there was a compromise -- if no overall Brexit deal is secured, Britain will keep “full alignment” with those rules of the EU’s single market that help cooperation between Ireland’s north and south.

But those words have reverberated in both London and Belfast, with Brexit minister David Davis saying they were more “a statement of intent” than a legally binding move.

The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May’s Conservative minority government in parliament, has said it is still concerned about how alignment could work without Britain staying in the EU’s single market and customs union.

For some campaigners for Britain to leave the EU, the possibility of having to follow the bloc’s rules meant that they could have Brexit in name only.

But May will say the commitments made in the first round of talks -- which includes a payment of 35-39 billion pounds over many years to meet EU obligations -- were necessary to sever ties with the bloc.

“In doing so we can move on to building the bold new economic and security relationships that can underpin the new deep and special partnership we all want to see,” she will say.

“A partnership between the European Union and a sovereign United Kingdom that has taken control of its borders, money and laws once again.”","irish democratic unionist party

Reuters Editorial,"Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins, whose support was crucial in passing the Senate tax reform bill earlier this month, said on Sunday she has not yet decided whether she will back the final measure negotiated by House and Senate leaders.",2017-12-10T20:15:20Z,reuters,Senator Collins says undecided on final tax bill vote,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/Higw2PECkqY/senator-collins-says-undecided-on-final-tax-bill-vote-idUSKBN1E40UH,/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171210&t=2&i=1213516144&w=400&r=LYNXMPEDB90RZ,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins, whose support was crucial in passing the Senate tax reform bill earlier this month, said on Sunday she has not yet decided whether she will back the final measure negotiated by House and Senate leaders.

The moderate Republican from Maine has laid out conditions for her support of a final “conference committee” version of the tax proposal. They include assurances that federal Medicare payments will not be cut and that Republicans will support two separate health care bills aimed at reducing premium costs.

Republican Senate leaders worked hard to get Collins’ support for the legislation, the largest change to U.S. tax laws since the 1980s that would slash the corporate tax rate.

The bill would lower the rate to as low as 20 percent, which Republican leaders say would encourage U.S. companies to invest more and boost economic growth. Democrats say the proposed cuts are a giveaway to businesses and the rich, financed with billions of dollars in taxpayer debt.

Collins’ vote was important since the Senate approved the bill by 51-49 vote after an 11th-hour scramble. With Republican Senator Bob Corker voting against the bill, there is little margin for losing support.

“I‘m going to look at what comes out of the conference committee meeting to reconcile the differences between the Senate and House bill. So I won’t make a final decision until I see what that package is,” she said on the CBS “Face the Nation” program on Sunday.

If Collins and Corker vote against the final tax bill, leading to a 50-50 tie, Republican Vice President Mike Pence would cast the winning vote. But if more than two Republican senators vote no, it would fail.

The House–Senate conference will hold an open meeting on Wednesday afternoon as it starts to reconcile differences.

Collins voted for the Senate’s tax reform legislation after Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, promised to support legislation to prop up U.S. health insurance markets.

But last week The Hill newspaper reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan told his staff that he wasn’t part of the deal that Collins brokered with Senate leaders.

Collins said she is “absolutely confident” of the leaders’ support and both McConnell and Ryan have put in writing that they will not allow a 4 percent cut in Medicare payments to take effect.

“I have read in correspondence that memorializes the agreement that the 4 percent cut in Medicare that could go into effect will not go into effect,” she said.

She added that she has the support of President Donald Trump, with whom she has discussed the issue three times.

“I have no reason to believe that that commitment will not be kept,” she said.","washington reuters republican us

Abadi, who is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, listened solemnly to Quranic verses from a chapter titled al-Nasr, meaning victory.

Iraqi forces recaptured the last areas still under Islamic State control along the border with Syria on Saturday and secured the western desert, marking the end of the war against the militants three years after they had captured about a third of Iraq’s territory.

The forces fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria now expect a new phase of guerrilla warfare.

Watching the parade on Sunday, state television showed Abadi sat on a throne-like chair placed between two Iraqi flags with the country’s official seal behind him, and with all other officials sat at a distance from him.

Abadi declared Dec. 10 would be an annual national holiday. Fighter jets were seen and heard flying over Baghdad’s skies.

An announcer introduced various factions who took on Islamic State as troops marched, tanks rolled by and helicopters hovered, all brandishing Iraqi flags as Abadi stood up and waved.

Those who fought were drawn from the army, air force, federal and local police, elite counter-terrorism forces, as well as Shi‘ite and Sunni paramilitaries and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. They received key air support from a U.S.-led global coalition.

In his victory speech, delivered on Saturday, Abadi did not mention the Peshmerga, who played a big part in the fight against Islamic State.

The central government in Baghdad is in conflict with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government after the latter unilaterally held an independence referendum in September.

Instead Abadi hailed the Iranian-trained and backed Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a group of Shi‘ite militias, many of whom are loyal to Iran.

He also said that the state should have a legitimate monopoly on arms, however. Disarming the PMF is seen as Abadi’s greatest challenge after Islamic State’s defeat.

The man who many saw as weak and ineffectual when he took over in 2014 from a predecessor who was blamed for the Islamic State takeover now heads towards an election next year as the commander who freed Iraqi lands.

Or as one Western diplomat described him - “the most popular man in Iraq.”","kurdish peshmerga

Reuters Editorial,"As she announced in January 2016 that the Philippines would immunize one million children with a new dengue vaccine, the nation's then health secretary Janette Garin boasted it was a world-first and a tribute to her country's ""expertise"" in research.",2017-12-10T17:53:20Z,reuters,Exclusive: Philippines defied experts' advice in pursuing dengue immunization program,http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/w3DHgz-S-wo/exclusive-philippines-defied-experts-advice-in-pursuing-dengue-immunization-program-idUSKBN1E40RR,/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171210&t=2&i=1213499646&w=400&r=LYNXMPEDB90NG,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"MANILA (Reuters) - As she announced in January 2016 that the Philippines would immunize one million children with a new dengue vaccine, the nation’s then health secretary Janette Garin boasted it was a world-first and a tribute to her country’s “expertise” in research.

At the time, it seemed the Philippines could be on the cusp of a breakthrough to combat a potentially lethal tropical virus that had been endemic in large parts of the Southeast Asian nation for decades.

Almost two years later, the program lies in tatters and has been suspended after Sanofi Pasteur, a division of French drug firm Sanofi, said at the end of last month the vaccine itself may in some cases increase the risk of severe dengue in recipients not previously infected by the virus.

Documents reviewed by Reuters that have not been disclosed until now, as well as interviews with local experts, show that key recommendations made by a Philippines Department of Health (DOH) advisory body of doctors and pharmacologists were not heeded before the program was rolled out to 830,000 children.

After Garin’s announcement, the Formulary Executive Council (FEC) of advisers urged caution over the vaccine because it said its safety and cost-effectiveness had not been established.

After twice meeting in January, the panel approved the state’s purchase of the vaccine on Feb 1, 2016 but recommended stringent conditions, minutes of all three meetings show.

“Based on the available scientific evidence presented to the Council, there is still a need to establish long-term safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness,” the FEC told Garin in a letter on that day. The letter was reviewed by Reuters.

The FEC said Dengvaxia should be introduced through small-scale pilot tests and phased implementation rather than across three regions in the country at the same time, and only after a detailed “baseline” study of the prevalence and strains of dengue in the targeted area, the FEC letter and minutes of the meetings said.

The experts also recommended that Dengvaxia be bought in small batches so the price could be negotiated down. An economic evaluation report commissioned by Garin’s own department had found the proposed cost of 1,000 pesos ($21.29) per dose was “not cost-effective” from a public payer perspective, the minutes from the meetings reveal.

For reasons that Reuters was unable to determine, these recommendations were ignored.

“VERY ANGRY”

The DOH purchased 3 million doses of Dengvaxia in one lot, enough for the required three vaccinations for each child in the proposed immunization program and paid 1,000 pesos per dose, a copy of the purchase order reviewed by Reuters shows.

It did conduct a “limited baseline study” in late February and March 2016, but the survey looked at “common illnesses” rather than the prevalence of dengue, according to guidelines issued by Garin’s office at the time and reviewed by Reuters.

Garin, who was part of the government of former president Benigno Aquino and replaced when President Rodrigo Duterte took power in June, 2016, did not respond to requests for comment on why she ignored the local experts’ recommendations.

A physician, Garin has defended her conduct and a program that she said was “implemented in accordance with WHO guidance and recommendations”.

“I understand the concern,” she told Philippine TV station ABS-CBN on Friday. “Even us, we’re also very angry when we learned about Sanofi’s announcement about severe dengue. I‘m also a mother. My child was also vaccinated. I was also vaccinated.”

DOH spokesman Lyndon Lee Suy also did not respond to text messages or questions emailed to him.

Sanofi Philippines declined comment on the Philippines government decision. However, Dr. Su-Peing Ng, Global Medical Head of Sanofi Pasteur, told Reuters: “We communicated all known benefits and risks of the vaccine to the Philippines government.”

Rontgene Solante, former president of the Philippines Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, said health officials were motivated to end the debilitating impact of dengue on the Philippines, where there are about 200,000 reported cases each year and many more unreported.

Over 1,000 people died of the disease in the country last year.

Two months after the FEC wrote to the health secretary, the DOH began immunizing one million students around the age of 10 in all three target areas in April 2016, in accordance with its original plan but at odds with the FEC’s recommendations to conduct a slow roll-out of the vaccine.

“The usual process for the DOH that has protected our children for so many decades was not followed. That’s a fact,” said Susan Mercado, a former Philippines health department undersecretary and former senior official at the World Health Organization (WHO).

WHO said in April 2016 that the Philippines’ campaign appeared to meet its criteria for using Dengvaxia because the targeted regions had high levels of dengue exposure; the vaccine would be provided to children 9 years and older; and they would each receive three doses.

Now, after Sanofi’s warnings, WHO has said it agrees with the government’s decision to suspend the immunization program.

SHOULDN‘T IGNORE EXPERTISE

The current secretary of health in the Duterte administration, Francisco Duque, said he would carry out a “thorough analysis” of the FEC’s recommendations and the program before passing judgment. He said the Council’s recommendations were not legally enforceable.

“At the end of the day, the final decision is made by (the)secretary of health,” he told Reuters. “But because of the expertise that the members of the FEC have, it is something that you don’t want to ignore.”

Underpinning the concerns in 2016 about Dengvaxia, since confirmed by Sanofi, were fears that the vaccine would act like a primary infection for those who had never had dengue.

If they were bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus after the vaccination, it could be akin to getting dengue a second time, which often leads to far more severe symptoms and potentially death if bad cases are not treated quickly.

The concerns were first raised by noted U.S.-based tropical disease expert, Dr. Scott Halstead, who urged both Sanofi and the WHO to proceed with caution.

In the Philippines, Dr. Antonio Dans, an epidemiologist from the University of the Philippines, led a delegation of physicians to the DOH in March 2016 where, citing Halstead’s research, they pressed for the campaign to be aborted.

“The data was not definitive but it was clear there were uncertainties and risks. Why not wait for the complete studies to be finished before endangering so many children?” Gans told Reuters.

In a Senate hearing late last year, Garin said she was aware of Halstead’s assessment but dismissed it. “This is a theory ... it has not been proven,” she said at the time.

FEAR AND CONFUSION

Two sources involved in the program said no antibody testing was undertaken, as recommended by the FEC.

Antibody testing, while not 100 percent accurate, indicates whether an individual has had dengue before.

Duque, the current health secretary, is demanding the company refund the 3 billion pesos ($60 million) paid for the vaccinations and has threatened legal action against Sanofi if it is proven to have withheld information.

A criminal probe is underway into how a danger to public health came about and two Congressional inquiries have been convened in the Philippines.

Duque told Reuters he was concerned that the program was paid from an “off-budget” allocation, meaning it bypassed Congressional scrutiny. Reuters was unable to confirm this.

Until now, one child out of the 830,000 vaccinated, a girl who was hospitalized with severe dengue, has been linked definitively by the DOH to the campaign. But the department of health says it still does not have complete data on those who fell ill after taking Dengvaxia.

The potential repeal of what should be a civic right should chill you to the bone. No, there is more than one future you should fear, and it isn’t just one that involves the (falsely reported) Portuguese internet where we pay $4.99 for access to streaming video. Don’t get me wrong – it’s totally possible, and not remotely the worst thing that could happen.

After spending twelve years running a company that helps millions of people to break through the barriers of censorship imposed by oppressive governments, I am quite familiar with the ramifications of such repressions. When a country lacks an open internet, the government (and companies friendly with said government) are able to do anything from simply blocking or banning apps entirely (EG: Facebook, Twitter, Skype, WhatsApp for censorship or economic reasons) to more aggressive moves such as Egypt’s effective shutdown of their internet service providers.

As a lucky American, it’s easy to say “this can’t happen here,” which is a reasonable, human gesture — we live under a democracy, but said democracy also has polarized politics and a totally different lobbying system to the rest of the world. While we have freedom of speech, we also have billions of for-profit lobbyist dollars acting as a cudgel against our interests.

Out of the top 50 last year, the top 10 included AT&T, spending $16.3 million, and Comcast (the largest cable provider in America and owner of NBCUniversal) ranked 12th, spending $14.3 million. Verizon* spent $10 million, and T-Mobile $8 million. AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, the NCTA ($13.4 million in lobbying in 2016) spent over half a billion dollars looking to destroy net neutrality.

What I want to establish is the hunger these companies have had for the destruction of your right to a neutral internet. America may not have a dictatorship, but it now, if net neutrality is repealed, will have an oligopoly. As Gizmodo has mapped out, net neutrality exists so that ISPs cannot legally “give preferential treatment to services they directly profit from and block those they don’t, all the while charging internet companies like Netflix additional fees for speedier access to consumers.”

There will be a legal argument back and forth, there will be petitions, but if this is how the FCC wishes for things to be, it will stay. So I want to walk you through what potentially could happen to America.

Things Get More Expensive

Americans already pay more than most countries for slower internet. Our internet providers, unlike recent changes made in the UK, don’t have to realistically advertise their internet speeds. So why would we believe that they’re going to be good to us?

The classic (and short-sighted when one thinks truly profitably) argument is that we’ll be charged for service packages which split up gaming, streaming, and other things. The “unlimited” plan will definitely become part of our future, $20 more for “unlimited” access. What most don’t realize is it’s likely not to be a blockage but a deliberate slowdown of traffic to these services otherwise, giving people a taste of what they’re missing (or, should I say, what they had).

Except we’re forgetting who owns many services that Americans enjoy. We may not be able to access Netflix on our “basic” plan at full speed, but we can of course access Hulu. Why? Because it’s owned by a corporate rat-king of Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Disney (which could soon own large parts of Fox) and Time Warner. Charter, owners of Time Warner, also own the ISPs Cox, Spectrum, CenturyLink, Road Runner and Frontier Communications. AT&T owns DirectTV, and wants to buy Time Warner.

Those ISPs account for almost every single part of the American internet. Netflix and Comcast may have a deal with set-top boxes, but that doesn’t mean that Comcast can’t start charging extra for it under an internet that they can rig in their favor.

The Brain Drain

Finally, an internet that costs more to do less is simply less attractive to talent. The US already has restrictive immigration and a high cost of living – by making it a hostile environment for those that don’t appease the internet’s overlords, we’re rejecting the future geniuses of tomorrow. When Netflix, Spotify and Amazon came along, they were plucky startups that large corporations didn’t think would bother them until it was too late. Now they border on utilities, and though I’ve suggested even giant companies can be disrupted, smaller ones could easily be quashed immediately. It doesn’t take a grand leap of faith for Comcast to say a competitive product, or one that in some way threatens them (or one of their for-profit companies) isn’t “safe” to have on their ISP. Any company that threatens an entertainment product owned by NBC, or the voice or data services of AT&T, or begins to syphon talent from Time Warner’s HBO is at risk. Future startups that are particularly data-hungry could find themselves having to pay the toll to ISPs.

Let’s take it one logical step further, and consider what Comcast could learn from your cloud storage provider. They could simply decide that anything coming from Amazon Web Services or Akamai — so most startups and companies – have to pay an overage per gigabyte to simply use their network.

If you don’t think they will, they’ve already begun. Comcast created their own Content Delivery Network to speed up delivery specifically to Comcast customers. They disputed it being “faster.” But of course they would.

These small steps amount to a powerful future fiefdom. The startups of tomorrow will become potential revenue streams for ISPs, either by creating preferential deals with cloud storage providers (raising costs across the board) or simply creating their own that gets there faster.

Moreover, ISP can now keep an eye out for breakthrough online services (the Amazons and Spotifies of tomorrow) and throttle them into oblivion while simultaneously launching their own copycat versions of those services. If you think that Twitter’s treatment of Meerkat was unfair, you haven’t seen anything yet.

The future is darker than you think. I urge you to realize that now, before it’s too late, and take action now. Talk to your friends, share this on social media, make your voice heard! Our friends at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have set up a simple yet powerful tool that allows you to call your representatives in the U.S. Congress and tell them to stop FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s from rolling back the existing net neutrality protections.

This and other similar initiatives are a great way to deliver the message to those who hope that you will stay silent until it’s too late to change anything. I hope we all will act as one now to stop this vicious all-out attack against our freedoms – the freedom of information, freedom of speech, freedom of enterprise, and freedom to choose what products and services to use.

One is always in search of the latest gimmick and the other has produced some of the most stunning in recent memory. The University of Manchester, long a leading force in research surrounding the one-atom-thick material, has teamed up with British sportswear brand inov-8 to bring graphene to footwear.

Unlike most of the research we’ve seen around science’s recent favorite miracle material, these things are headed to the market in our lifetimes — a seemingly miracle in and of itself. In fact, they’re due out next year, priced at a steep, but not completely unreasonable, £140 and £150 (around $200 on the high end).

There are no miracles present in this particular implementation, but the graphene should make the kicks more flexible and a hell of a lot stronger than traditional running shoes. Graphene, after all, is the thinnest material around and about 200x stronger than steel. The researchers heated it and added tiny particles to the shoes’ soles.

“When added to the rubber used in inov-8’s G-Series shoes, graphene imparts all its properties, including its strength,” university reader Dr. Aravind Vijayaraghavan said in a statement tied to the shoes. “Our unique formulation makes these outsoles 50-percent stronger, 50-percent more stretchy and 50-percent more resistant to wear than the corresponding industry standard rubber without graphene.”

At the very least, it’s a pretty solid way of standing out in a clothing category that’s increasingly fixated on innovation, from Adidas’s 3D-printed sneakers to Nike’s self-tying ones.

Manchester researchers have long discussed graphene’s potential role in wearables. In addition to all of the aforementioned super powers, it’s also transparent and more conductive than copper — all great potential traits for the next generation of electronics. The school recently demonstrated the ability to print the material for sensors, as well, meaning that these sneakers are likely just the start of something much bigger.","aravind vijayaraghavan

"Ingrid Lunden, Katie Roof","As Spotify continues to inch towards a public listing, Apple is making a move of its own to step up its game in music services. Sources tell us that the..",2017-12-08T20:38:57Z,techcrunch,Sources: Apple is acquiring music recognition app Shazam,https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/sources-apple-is-acquiring-music-recognition-app-shazam/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/shazam-app-icon-ios.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"As Spotify continues to inch towards a public listing, Apple is making a move of its own to step up its game in music services. Sources tell us that the company is close to acquiring Shazam, the popular app that lets people identify any song, TV show, film or advert in seconds, by listening to an audio clip or (in the case of, say, an ad) a visual fragment, and then takes you to content relevant to that search.

We have heard that the deal is being signed this week, and will be announced on Monday, although that could always change.

One source describes the deal as in the nine figures; another puts it at around £300 million ($401 million). We are still asking around. Notably, though, the numbers we’ve heard are lower than the $1.02 billion (according to PitchBook) post-money valuation the company had in its last funding round, in 2015.

In all, Shazam has raised $143.5 million from investors that include Kleiner Perkins, London’s DN Capital, IVP and strategic investors Sony Music, Universal Music and Access Industries (which owns Warner Music). Kleiner Perkins also invested in competitor SoundHound.

Shazam last noted that it passed 1 billion downloads, but that was back in September 2016, meaning those numbers are likely higher now.

But in the world of apps, high numbers do not always translate into profits: In September 2017, Shazam reportedly made £40.3 million ($54 million) in revenues in its 2016 fiscal year, which was a turnaround from the declines between FY 2014 and 2015. It made a statutory pre-tax loss of £4 million ($5.3 million) in 2016, which was still a loss but significantly smaller than the £16.6 million loss in FY 2015.

The company’s CEO Rich Riley noted earlier this year, however, that operating at or near profitability is the intention as it’s been growing; and he also hinted that the company was, as a result, likely an acquisition target.

Shazam launched way back in 1999, well before the days of apps, as a service you reached by way of a SMS code — in fact, its first name was 2580, after the number you typed in the UK to access the service.

Since those early days, it’s launched a number of related services. Artists on Shazam lets you follow famous people and see what music they are Shazamming.

Its augmented reality brand marketing service lets you discover content based on pictures that you snap with the app. “You came for music, stay to experience McDonald’s Karaoke, MTN Dew VR Racing and much more,” is the company’s pitch on this feature.

It also integrates with other apps like Snapchat and Apple’s Siri, and it currently sends lots of traffic to other music apps like Spotify and Apple Music, which pays it when those clicks convert to purchases.

It’s not clear what will carry on post acquisition, and which of these might be something that Apple would integrate into its own business (and how), but it’s notable that much of what Shazam does is very synergistic with what Apple is working on already: AR, and more features to attract more users to the Apple Music platform.

Apple has made dozens of other acquisitions, and one of the biggest has been in the area of music: it acquired Beats for $3 billion in 2014, which became the basis for Apple Music. That service has around 30 million users as of September of this year. As a point of comparison, Spotify has over 60 million paying subscribers, with 140 million overall.

We’ve reached out to Shazam and Apple for comment. We’ll update this story as we learn more.

Sarah Perez,"Following its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple released updated App Store guidelines that included a new rule allowing it to ban apps created by a..",2017-12-08T19:01:57Z,techcrunch,Apple’s widened ban on templated apps is wiping small businesses from the App Store,https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/apples-widened-ban-on-templated-apps-is-wiping-small-businesses-from-the-app-store/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bizness-apps.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"F

ollowing its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple released updated App Store guidelines that included a new rule allowing it to ban apps created by a “commercialized template or app generation service.” The understanding at the time was this was part of Apple’s larger App Store cleanup , and the focus was on helping rid the marketplace of low-quality clone and spam apps. But things have since changed. A number of app-building companies that had earlier believed themselves to be in the clear are now being affected, as well.

Many companies have recently been given a January 1, 2018 deadline, after which point any new apps they submit will be rejected by the App Store Review team, they’ve been told by Apple. In the meantime, some have been able to maintain their existing apps, but it’s unclear how long that will last.

Example of Apple’s App Store rejection notices for rule 4.2.6.

Example of Apple’s App Store rejection notices for rule 4.3.

What’s unfortunate about the expanded policy enforcement is that these app makers specifically target the small business market. They build apps for businesses that don’t have the internal resources to build their own apps or can’t afford to hire a custom shop to design a new iOS app from scratch.

Instead, these companies help small businesses like local retailers, restaurants, small fitness studios, nonprofits, churches and other organizations to create an app presence using templates, drag-and-drop wizards and various tools to put together a more basic app that can then be customized further with their own branding and images.

These may not be the most-used apps, to be sure, but for the niche audiences they serve – say, for example, customers of a local pizza place that would rather have its own app rather than paying the fees associated with being on a food ordering platform like Seamless/GrubHub or Uber Eats – they serve a useful purpose.

As one app builder put it, the decision to limit these small businesses’ ability to compete on the App Store is as if a web hosting company said that they would no longer allow web pages built with WordPress templates or those made using website wizards from services like Wix or Squarespace.

Apple’s move, which appears to be blocking a large number of small businesses from the App Store, has now caught the attention of Congress.

In a letter dated December 1, 2017, Congressman Ted W. Lieu (33rd District, California) has asked Apple to reconsider its expanded enforcement of its 4.2.6 and 4.3 guidelines. The former bans the template-based apps while the latter is more of a catch-all for banning spam – a rule Apple is now using if it can’t prove that the app was built using some sort of wizard or drag-and-drop system.

“Recently, I was informed that Apple’s decision to more stringently enforce its policy guidelines regarding design and functionality may result in the wholesale rejection of template-based apps from the App Store,” wrote Lieu. “It is my understanding that many small businesses, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house.”

The Congressman suggests that Apple is now casting “too wide a net” in its effort to remove spam and illegitimate apps from the App Store, and is “invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store’s integrity.”

Above: Rep. Ted W. Lieu’s letter to Apple

The expansion of the policy has had a dampening effect on the industry that serves these smaller businesses.

One company, Shoutem, already shut down as a result, for instance. (Only a small team remains to support current customers.)

Explained Shoutem CEO Viktor Marohic, the company closed up shop a few weeks ago – a decision he attributes to the change to the App Store guidelines, combined with the challenges of operating a business in this space.

“The 4.2.6 was just a final drop that made us move on a bit faster with that decision [to close],” he said of Shoutem’s closure. “It was also a threat to our enterprise business, since it is hard to predict what Apple might do next. While we understand their intentions, the general approach that they took turned out to be quite unfair to our enterprise customers that actually built fully custom apps on top of our platform and do not share much of the code with other apps built on the platform,” said Marohic.

Another company affected by the rule is ChowNow, which designs apps for restaurants using components that allow them to have their own online ordering systems and loyalty programs.

ChowNow used to be an Apple favorite. In fact, the company was even quoted in Apple’s documentation regarding best practices for Apple Pay because it was one of the first companies to integrate Apple’s payments technology into its app-building platform.

But even ChowNow is being told by Apple that after January 1, things will change for them.

Above: How different can restaurant apps really be? Big brands vs. ChowNow (right)

“There was no way in June [when the guidelines changed] that we would have said, ‘that’s going to target our apps,'” ChowNow CEO Christopher Webb told TechCrunch of how he first reacted to the news. “Apple had told us you aren’t being targeted by this from a quality standpoint. So being hit now under the umbrella of spam is shocking to every quality developer out there and all the good actors.”

Apple’s concern over template-based apps for restaurants, Webb added, also doesn’t make sense because “there’s only so much you can do with apps that perform the same utility – ordering food.”

Pizza apps, for example, will all tend to have photos of pizza, use red in their designs, and offer buttons for pickup and delivery.

In addition, ChowNow’s apps use 100 percent native code, while big brands like Pizza Hut and Domino’s contain web views.

Apple hasn’t sent out any large-scale communication to its developer community about the expanded enforcement of its rules. Instead, all conversations it’s having are one-on-ones with individual businesses. This allows it to more selectively curate its own list of “winners and losers” in terms of which companies will be targeted by the changes.

Not surprisingly, Apple’s partnership with IBM, which involves IBM building template-based apps for enterprise clients, is not impacted by the new rules.

The irony with regard to this situation is that Apple has taken a strong position on net neutrality, arguing that all businesses have the right to an open internet. Wrote Apple’s U.S. Vice President for Public Policy Cynthia Hogan in a letter to the FCC this August:

Broadband providers should not block, throttle, or otherwise discriminate against lawful websites and services. Far from new, this has been a foundational principle of the FCC’s approach to net neutrality for over a decade. Providers of online goods and services need assurance that they will be able to reliably reach their customers without interference from the underlying broadband provider.

However, what Apple’s doing with its expanded ban of templated apps is the equivalent of preventing small businesses from being able to compete in the same ecosystem as the bigger brands. It’s the gatekeeper effectively creating a system that impacts the little guy by interfering with their ability to do business on the web – a web we increasingly access through native apps, not a browser.

According to 2017 data from Flurry, mobile browser usage dropped from 20 percent in 2013 to just 8 percent in 2016, with the rest of our time spent in apps, for example. They are our doorway to the web and the way we interact with services.

“Rule 4.2.6 is a concrete illustration of the danger of Apple’s dominant position,” lamented Jérôme Granados, of Goodbarber – a company that had fortunately invested in progressive web apps ahead of Apple’s changes. “This rule prevents many local newspapers, online media, NGOs, religious communities, sports clubs, local stores, schools, universities, local public administrations, and other actors with limited means, to count among their audience iPhone users,” he told TechCrunch.

Among these businesses’ frustrations is the fact that an App Store cleanup didn’t have to involve the wholesale removal of small businesses’ apps. Apple could have just unlisted apps from category pages to reduce the “clutter,” or only returned the apps in search results when customers type in more exactly matching names.

“We understand the need to clean up the App Store, but we feel Apple could have gone about it in a different way,” noted Bizness Apps CEO Andrew Gazdecki, who is transitioning his clients to progressive web apps, per Apple’s advice.

“We’re concerned that this rejection notice is problematic because what’s being called into question isn’t the quality of the app, but rather the way in which it’s generated,” Gazdecki said. The CEO yesterday set up a Change.org petition to plead with Apple to change its mind. Over 250 signatures have been added, as of the time of writing.

“They’ve wiped out pretty much an entire industry. Not just DIY tools like AppMakr, but also development suites like Titanium,” said Jay Shapiro, CEO of AppMakr, which now builds apps for international markets where Android dominates.

Above: The original version of the Official Lumineers app, built by AppMakr

We’ve also heard from one source that the change will affect other companies building apps, including MindBody (apps for fitness studios), eChurch and Custom Church Apps (apps for churches), Olo (apps for restaurants), Hopscotch (games), uCampaign (apps for Republican lawmakers) and others. [Hearing that Hopscotch may not be affected; others haven’t commented.]

“I’m sure that Apple has some business rationale for doing this, but they have just disenfranchised an entire ecosystem and none of us can really understand why,” Shapiro said. “There were much easier ways to fix their perceived problem.”

Matt Swider,10 gadgets compared for your holiday wish list,2017-12-08T15:46:56.341Z,techradar,This vs That: Holiday Gift decisions you need to make,http://www.techradar.com/news/this-vs-that-holiday-gift-decisions-you-need-to-make,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dnuW6mJYuYvqsYx624jLsE-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Gifting decisions during the holidays are difficult, and so is asking for the right gadget when you’re on the receiving end. There always seem to be two (or more) gadgets to choose between.

Do you get an iPhone or an Android this year? Which AI speaker path do travel down for the rest of your life, Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa or Google Home Mini with Google Assistant? Are you going to be playing Nintendo games for the next four years or become a PlayStation gamer?

These are the questions that make or break a good wish list for the holidays. That’s why we’ve put together a this vs that comparison in order to direct you to the right product for you.

Let the gadget duel begin.

iPhone X vs Samsung Galaxy S8

5.8-inch screens are the rage right now, with both Apple and Samsung pining to get you to buy into their redesigned flagship phones. It’s easy to like both, thanks to their tall, expansive screens that have a nearly bezel-free face. It looks like the future.

What it comes down to: Do you like iOS 11 or prefer Android Nougat? Losing Apple’s iMessage by switching to Android remains a problem, so that could sway you. On the other hand, Samsung’s phone is cheaper and has a headphone jack and a fingerprint sensor. Granted the sensor is on the back and in an awkward spot. In this case, past features may determine your future phone.

Amazon Echo Dot vs Google Home Mini

Amazon and Google are in an AI war and also a price war right now. They’re doing everything in their power to sway you to their flavor of a smart assistant inside your home. Both can play music, control your lights and answer questions.

What it comes down to: Amazon’s Alexa assistant the Google Assistant are becoming more alike everyday. Alexa can do more right now, but Google’s deeper into machine learning and leveraging its search data to enhance Google Home and predict what you want to know. Right now, we like the Echo Dot, but that can easily change in 2018.

Fitbit Ionic vs Apple Watch Series 3

Fitbit makes a true smartwatch now, and it still has excellent activity tracking chops to go head-to-head with the brand new Apple Watch 3. They both receive your smartphone notifications, track your daily steps and even have contactless payment chips inside. Fitbit and Apple are clearly going after the same people.

What it comes down to: The first thing you will notice is that Fitbit Ionic is cheaper than the Apple Watch 3. But the price difference isn’t that big. Apple Watch is faster, brighter and has a better, refined interface thanks to watchOS 4. Fitbit has the leg up in putting your activity tracking at the forefront.

iPad Pro 10.5-inch vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S3

Apple and Samsung make the best tablets and they had two new flagships in 2017. Both the iPad Pro 10.5-inch and 9.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 offer nearly the same sized beautiful screen for watching movies and staying productive with a stylus (an Apple Pencil or an S Pen).

What it comes down to: Apple has the best tablet app selection, meaning the Samsung tablet suffers because Android apps much of the operating system isn’t built for a tablet in mind. But we still like Samsung’s screen and speakers just as much as the iPad Pro and it costs less. If you’re willing to spend more, though, go with an Apple tablet of any size.

Nintendo Switch vs PS4

Nintendo and Sony have the two most popular video game consoles in 2017, and that means you have a tough decision to make. You’re unlikely going to buy both at once, and they cost nearly the same amount of money to buy.

What it comes down to: Nintendo Switch is our favorite because it’s portable (though not pocketable) and it has games like Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8, and Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The Nintendo hits won’t stop coming in 2018. Sony’s system leads in power and mature games, including Call of Duty WW2 and Star Wars Battlefront 2. And it’s more likely to get the next Grand Theft Auto and other titles that demand better performance. It all comes down to video game preference in our minds.

MacBook Pro vs Dell XPS 13

Dell has delivered our favorite 13-inch laptop two years running, but many people prefer macOS and that’s an Apple-only affair. You’re going to need a MacBook for that and a whole lot more money. Both laptops come in 15-inch configurations, too.

What it comes down to: Are you bent on running Windows 10 or macOS, and are you willing to pay extra money for the latter? Both have a slick design, but the Apple TouchBar does little and we think the Dell laptop has a more modern look to it. It’s more for your money.","mario odyssey mario kart

Matt Swider,Apple's best camera features are being replicated on Android,2017-12-07T00:47:21.34Z,techradar,Anything iPhone X can do… Android phones will get ‘deep portrait’ mode and Face ID,http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x-answered-new-android-phones-will-get-deep-portrait-and-face-id,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sQp5sUbJwB3KDzixKVwUSb-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The iPhone X has been out for a little more than a month, but there are already plans to replicate its headline features in 2018's high-end Android phones.

'Deep portrait' selfie photography, and Face ID and Unlock, will be supported by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 chipset, which is likely to be in a majority of top Androids next year.

This will enable bokeh-rich portrait photos from the selfie camera, which we've mainly seen on rear-facing cameras among Android phones. Blurring the background in your subject-focused selfies is a much more compelling effect than selfie beauty mode and skin smoothing, which almost blurs... you.

And while Android handsets have had a primitive version of Face ID and Unlock, Qualcomm's solution is being touted as a way to match Apple's TrueDepth front-facing camera. It all needs to start at the system-on-a-chip level.

We don't know which phones will support the Snapdragon 845 chipset, and in turn support deep portrait selfies and Face ID, but almost all major phone makers did have the Snapdragon 835 chipset at the core of their hardware. The Samsung Galaxy S9 may be the first with the new 10nm silicon.

Ready for Android Animoji?

You can also expect to see more 3D face-mapping on Android phones to match what we've seen from Apple's Animoji feature.

Qualcomm's new chipset has active depth-sensing and supports IR sensors for face-mapping. The company also talked up the security of its chip, noting that face-mapping security is of the utmost importance.

The Huawei-made Honor View 10 is already attempting to clone Animoji, but having the architecture in place on the chip is vital to improving performance and adoption of the next-generation of front-facing camera features.","subjectfocused

As well as giving out dozens of awards, including a trio for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the awards ceremony also played host to a number of exclusive trailer reveals.

Here's our pick of the best.

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds fans got their best look yet at the game's new desert map in a new trailer. Called Mirimar, the map will introduce all new vehicles and weapons to the game, and will be available alongside the game's 1.0 release which was announced as coming on December 20th.

Death Stranding made a big appearance at last year's ceremony, and this year was no different. We won't try and explain the trailer that was shown, but you can watch it in all its insanity below.

Bayonetta was one of the best games released on the Xbox 360, and Bayonetta 2 was one of the Wii U's few exclusive game's worth caring about. Both are set to appear on the Nintendo Switch alongside an all new entry in the series.

Called, appropriately, Bayonetta 3, the new game was announced with a trailer that you can watch below.

Campo Santo burst onto the scene with the excellent Firewatch back in 2016, and last night saw the announcement of their next game, 'In the Valley of the Gods'.

Our final pick is the announcement trailer for Vacation Simulator, by the same team that brought you Job Simulator. With the latter game making for a perfect fit for today's nascent VR headsets, we're excited to see what the spiritual sequel makes of the hardware.

There were tons more games shown off too. You can find a full list of every trailer shown on The Game Awards' official YouTube channel.","youtube channel

We've got some great news for you then, as Sony has given both a massive discount for the next week. At these prices though, we wouldn't expect stock to last long.

PlayStation VR bundles are now $100 cheaper than the standard price and many of these bundles are cheaper than they were on Black Friday. The PS4 Pro can be picked up for $50 less than usual for either the standalone console, or the highly sought-after Star Wars: Battlefront 2 and Destiny 2 bundles.

Sony has pushed down these prices at the perfect time of year just as we hoped they would. The PS4 Pro is now a 4K console considerably cheaper than the new Xbox One X and PSVR units have been flying off shelves lately, pointing towards a strong future for what is arguably the most popular VR platform on the planet right now.

We don't expect to see prices this good again for a few months, so now's the time to strike if any of these items are on your wishlist. The discounts will end on December 16 or until stock lasts.

PlayStation VR bundles

PlayStation VR | GT Sport | PS4 camera | $199 @ Amazon

GT Sport and PlayStation VR are a great match, especially if you're a fan of using the in-car viewpoint. How else are you going to enjoy those lovingly recreated interiors? We're stoked to see this PlayStation VR bundle deal include the camera too. Especially as you need it to get the PSVR headset working in the first place! We can't quite believe this is $100 cheaper today, and given the amount of PSVR headsets sold around Black Friday, expect more devs to start pumping out VR titles. View PlayStation VR deal: PSVR headset, GT Sport, PS4 camera $199 @ AmazonView Deal

PlayStation VR | PS4 camera | Doom VFR | $299 @ Amazon

This PlayStation VR bundle has had a massive $100 knocked off too. You're probably wondering why it's still $100 more than the GT Sport bundle though? Well, the headset in this one is the brand new CUH - ZVR2 version with the in-ear headphones built into the headset rather than the cable. The cable itself is lighter than the original and the passthrough box can now display HDR images on your 4K TV, so you won't need to mess around with swapping HDMI cables when not using the VR headset. But are those improvements worth $100 to you when the headset itself is largely the same? View PlayStation VR bundle: PSVR, camera, Doom VFR $299View Deal

PlayStation VR | PS4 camera | Skyrim VR | 2 Move controllers | $349 @ Amazon

This PSVR bundle comes with everything you need for the full on VR experience with the headset, camera and two PlayStation move motion controllers. You can then get stuck in with those controllers to enjoy Skyrim VR the way it was intended. This bundle's more expensive than the two above because of the extra controllers and this is also the newer CUH - ZVR2 version of the PSVR headset as described in the deal above.

PS4 Pro bundle deals

Limited Edition PS4 Pro | Star Wars: Battlefront II | $399 @ Amazon

It's not the best looking limited edition console we've ever seen if we're honest, but if you're after a PS4 Pro and the very good-looking Star Wars: Battlefront II then this bundle is $399 today. The $50 reduction brings it back to the Black Friday price. View PS4 Pro deal: Limited Edition PS4 Pro, Battlefront II $399 @ AmazonView Deal

White PS4 Pro with Destiny 2 | $399 @ Newegg

The new white PS4 Pro is only available as a Destiny 2 bundle for now. Not that we're complaining, especially seeing as a regular PS4 Pro is usually around $400 on its own and Destiny 2 is around $60. Plus this edition comes with the Destiny 2 expansion pass. Sony knocking $50 makes this the best price yet and the perfect time to buy if you want a PS4 Pro this year.

John McCann,Is ID in an app ready for real life?,2017-12-08T12:15:54.341Z,techradar,I left my ID at home and used my phone to prove I can buy beer,http://www.techradar.com/news/i-left-my-id-at-home-and-used-my-phone-to-prove-i-can-buy-beer,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zTY5DFCvt5ZBaKknkpio9U-1200-80.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"I walk up to the bar, but there's not a member of staff in sight. Just a few beer taps, with the levers and nozzles facing me, and some empty glasses.

It's too tempting, so I grab myself a glass, position it under the nozzle and pull the lever down. Nothing. Not even a drop. The screen above the tap tells me I need to verify I'm old enough to drink but there's a problem: no one is here to check my age.

All is not lost. I pull out my smartphone, load the Yoti app and scan the QR code on the display above the beer tap using my handset's camera.

After posing for a quick selfie (at the app's request), the screen above the beer tap declares I am of legal drinking age. I pull the leaver again, and to my delight the beer from a London-based microbrewery flows into my glass.

""This is excellent,"" I think to myself, ""but also way too easy.""

Can an app really replace the tried-and-tested method of formal, physical identification?

The team behind Yoti seem to think so.

Finally, time to pour a beer

'Online identity is kind of a broken system'

TechRadar sat down with Yoti co-founder, Robin Tombs, who told us why he started Yoti.

""Online identity is kind of a broken system,"" Tombs explained.

""If I have a bit of knowledge about you, your name, date of birth and address, I can sign you up to a website with a username and password I know, and you have no idea this has happened.

""The website either doesn't check you at all, or it checks a piece of knowledge (name, DOB, address) about you against the electoral roll or a similar system and will assume it's you.""

Tombs and his co-founders looked at the system and seeing it hadn't changed significantly in about 25 years, wanted to come up with a trusted solution to fix the problem with verifying people are who they say they are online.

However it was real-world events - such as running meets, where hundreds (if not, thousands) of people turn up to register on the name, be assigned tracking devices and sign injury waivers - which sparked the Yoti team to start really looking into a way of streamlining the process.

Yoti could be coming to supermarket checkouts near you

""We asked ourselves, are the smartphones ready? Well they're getting pretty good, biometrics are getting pretty good, let's look into things like passports.

""Once we realized we could read the microchip in a passport, we thought 'right, let's go ahead and start Yoti'.""

This was three years ago, and the application has been in beta mode for about nine months with availability in over 100 countries, and it's recently launched a final version on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

What it offers is a way of providing verified identification in a wide range of scenarios, from entering a nightclub and buying a drink at the bar, to proving to a self-service checkout you're old enough to purchase a bottle of wine and providing a website with a 100% guarantee you are who you say you are.

Trust is key

The major roadblock for Yoti at the moment is convincing businesses that its service works, and can't be fooled by fraudsters.

Trust is taken very seriously. When you sign up to the app you're asked to provide a selfie, your mobile number (and a text is sent to you with a code to tie the service and your phone together) and a picture of your ID. You'll also need to record a short video within the app which displays a few words on screen for you to say.

Trust is taken very seriously. When you sign up to the app you're asked to provide a selfie, your mobile number (and a text is sent to you with a code to tie the service and your phone together) and a picture of your ID, and you'll need to record a short video within the app which displays a few words on screen for you to say.

Yoti is already used by Freeads – a classifieds site that allows sellers to verify themselves, giving confidence to buyers NSPCC/Childline – allowing under 18s to anonymously verify their age, so they can flag malicious and upsetting online content Deltic – the UK’s leading nightclub operator is using Yoti to verify age on the door

All these parameters are then compared and checked by Yoti's facial recognition software, but also by its own team of 'super recognizers' who work in clean rooms, where the only tech allowed inside is the machine and software that allows them to do their job.

Each person's details are checked by two randomly assigned employees working in the clean room, which stops any risk of collusion. All this makes it very difficult for a bot, or someone pretending to be you, to fool the system.

What Yoti needs to do is convince businesses that its systems are secure, reliable and trustworthy every time - which means the team is meeting with various businesses across the UK.

""Trust is one of the absolute crucial elements… we have to literally go round to the different bars,"" Tombs explains, ""and it's a big hurdle that will take time to gain acceptance.

""It's new, it's different and people will worry the technology may be circumnavigated.""

For now, many interested businesses are keeping an eye on Yoti trials to see how the software performs, before committing to the platform.

Currently it's being used by Deltic, the UK's biggest nightclub operator, in two venues in England, while two of the four leading UK supermarkets will also pilot the scheme from early 2018 in two areas of the country.

What's it like to use?

We trialed the service in a number of scenarios, including a self-service supermarket checkout, on the door of a nightclub and at a self-service bar, and Yoti is surprisingly quick and easy.

On all occasions we were required to scan a QR code that is displayed on the checkout display or a doorman’s phone - which the app recognized in a split second. In some instances, such as at the supermarket, the app also required us to snap a quick selfie to prove that it was us using it - rather than a younger sibling or friend trying to chance their luck.

Again, we didn't experience any issues with the selfie stage, even in the low light of the demo area.

Image 1 of 4 Approaching the bar, you need to prove your age by scanning the QR code with the Yoti app Image 2 of 4 The Yoti app will then share your date of birth so you can pour a beer Image 3 of 4 To get into a nightclub, you scan a QR code on a phone the door staff have Image 4 of 4 It then shares your name, photo and date of birth so they can confirm you're old enough

There are still a few teething problems though. First off, every time you load the Yoti app you have to enter you PIN, however a fingerprint option will be made available from early 2018 (assuming your phone has a fingerprint reader) to make the login process more seamless.

Secondly, the app requires an internet connection to work, so if you find yourself in a basement club or a signal black spot in a store you may struggle to use Yoti.

A workaround that's due to arrive in 2018 is the Yoti key. This is a NFC tag you order (and pay a small amount for) from Yoti, with your name, DOB and selfie imprinted onto a plastic tag you can put on a set of keys.

This will allow you to still gain access to nightclubs, even if your phone has run out of power.

Things are still very much in their infancy for Yoti then, but it's a confident step towards having your digital identity on your phone.

Tombs believes that within five to 10 years, most people will have a form of digital identity on their phone. Looking further into the future he hopes it can bring in your driving license, passport, car ownership documents and even title deeds to your home all on your handset.","yoti online identity

Melanie Zanona,"Congress punted its funding fight for another two weeks, setting up a contentious spending showdown just days before Christmas.",2017-12-10T21:02:54Z,the-hill,Five issues that could derail a spending deal,http://thehill.com/homenews/house/364043-five-issues-that-could-derail-a-spending-deal,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/spending_daca_defense_getty.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Congress punted its funding fight for another two weeks, setting up a contentious spending showdown just days before Christmas.

Lawmakers passed a stopgap bill on Thursday to avoid a shutdown and keep the government’s lights on through Dec. 22. But members acknowledge that the real budget brawl — and the threat of a shutdown — will come later this month.

The funding fight will likely center on two major issues. Democrats want protections for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children, while the GOP wants a funding boost for defense.

But there are a host of other year-end funding priorities that both parties will also be scrambling to address before they leave town, in addition to negotiating a final tax bill that Republicans hope to send to President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Democrat slams Donald Trump Jr. for ‘serious case of amnesia’ after testimony Skier Lindsey Vonn: I don’t want to represent Trump at Olympics Poll: 4 in 10 Republicans think senior Trump advisers had improper dealings with Russia MORE’s desk by Christmas.

Here are five sticky issues that are threatening to complicate year-end spending talks.

Immigration

Trump announced earlier this year that he was ending the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants work permits to undocumented young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children.

Congress has just a few months left to save the program or come up with a new solution, with DACA recipients set to lose their status beginning in early March.

ADVERTISEMENT

Many Democrats and even some Republicans likeRep.(R-Fla.) have demanded that any spending legislation that stretches into 2018 shield so-called Dreamers from deportation.

They view the must-pass spending bills as their best shot at getting a DACA solution over the finish line.

“We will not leave here without a DACA fix,” Pelosi vowed Thursday.

But conservatives have put their foot down on the issue, saying that attaching any DACA deal to a continuing resolution would be a non-starter with the Republican conference.

GOP leaders in both chambers have made clear that they oppose linking DACA to government spending bills, setting up a potential showdown at the end of the month.

Republicans have in the past had to rely on Pelosi and the Democrats to pass stopgap funding bills, though the House passed the two-week spending bill this week without Democrats. However, Democratic support will still be needed in the Senate.

“A DACA solution will be a standalone solution,” Rep. Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsTrump rips Dems a day ahead of key White House meeting Overnight Health Care: 3.6M signed up for ObamaCare in first month | Ryan pledges 'entitlement reform' next year | Dems push for more money to fight opioids Overnight Finance: Trump says shutdown 'could happen' | Ryan, conservatives inch closer to spending deal | Senate approves motion to go to tax conference | Ryan promises 'entitlement reform' in 2018 MORE (R-N.C.), chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, told reporters on Thursday. “If DACA gets attached to the spending bill, there will be major, major pushback.""

Defense

It’s all but certain that Congress will need to pass another continuing resolution (CR) on Dec. 22 in order to buy more time to write a massive, omnibus spending package.

But defense hawks and conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus worry that yet another short-term spending bill would be harmful for the military.

They are insisting that leadership boost money for the Pentagon before the end of the year – and have threatened to vote against another CR this year if that doesn’t happen.

One option being considered would be to move a legislative package that funds defense at higher levels through September alongside a short-term patch to fund the rest of the government at current levels through January.

It’s unclear whether Democrats would be willing to go along with the idea. Their support would be crucial in the Senate, where at least eight Democratic votes are needed to overcome a filibuster.

Democrats have traditionally insisted that any increase in defense spending above budget caps be paired with an increase in spending on domestic programs.

“I would not support that,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who caucuses with Democrats and sits on the Armed Services Committee, said of the defense-continuing resolution package.

But House Republicans could just jam the Senate with the defense-first package and dare vulnerable Democrats like Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.) to vote against a bill fully funding the military, especially with the escalating nuclear threat from North Korea hanging over their heads.

“Then they can go home and explain why they can’t fund the American military when the House did,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an Appropriations cardinal.

ObamaCare

Further complicating spending talks is the commitment that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGOP strategist donates to Alabama Democrat McConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees Brent Budowsky: A plea to Alabama voters MORE (R-Ky.) gave to Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsOvernight Health Care: 3.6M signed up for ObamaCare in first month | Ryan pledges 'entitlement reform' next year | Dems push for more money to fight opioids Study: ObamaCare bills backed by Collins would lower premiums Right scrambles GOP budget strategy MORE (R-Maine) to help win her vote for the GOP tax reform bill.

McConnell pledged to support passage of two bipartisan ObamaCare fixes before the end of the year, which could be attached to a government funding bill.

But House conservatives say they oppose the measures seen as simply propping up ObamaCare.

To lock up the necessary Republican votes for the two-week CR this week, House GOP leadership promised that the next spending bill would not contain funding for ObamaCare cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments, according to Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.).

“The three things that we’ve been told are not going to happen as part of our agreement: no CSRs, no DACA, no debt limit,” said Walker, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee

Disaster aid

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to provide more supplemental funding for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, as well as for western areas devastated by wildfires.

The thinking is that disaster aid could be attached to the next CR, but members are still debating the price tag, according to Walker.

The White House last month requested another $44 billion in disaster aid, which would be the third infusion of cash to help with relief and recovery efforts.

But the funding request has been under fire from lawmakers who say it doesn’t go far enough to address the damage from the string of natural disasters.

And the White House has insisted that the latest disaster package be offset with cuts to non-defense federal programs, which could be problematic for Democrats.

Other health care issues

Democrats are also fighting for two health care priorities that could have bipartisan support: the renewal of a popular children’s health program and more money to combat the opioid crisis.

Many members are pushing to renew the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which expired in September.

Republicans have said the issue could be attached to the next CR in an effort to sweeten the pot and attract more Democratic votes for the stopgap bill.

Democrats have also indicated that they want additional funding to fight the deadly opioid crisis in a larger spending deal.

Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency this year, but he stopped short of declaring it a national emergency — a designation that would have allocated new federal money toward the crisis.

It’s unclear, however, if additional dollars will come in a spending package.

“We've done a lot, put a lot of resources into combating opioids already,” the Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Sen.

Mallory Shelbourne,"Media outlets are under fire after two news organizations were recently forced to issue corrections over inaccurate reporting, putting a brighter spotlight on the media as President Trump seizes on the chance to discredit journalists.",2017-12-10T21:22:20Z,the-hill,Media mistakes intensify debate over 'fake news',http://thehill.com/homenews/media/364193-debate-rages-over-media-mistakes,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cnn_062717getty_lead.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Media outlets have remained under fire for several days amid a debate over journalism in an age when President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Democrat slams Donald Trump Jr. for ‘serious case of amnesia’ after testimony Skier Lindsey Vonn: I don’t want to represent Trump at Olympics Poll: 4 in 10 Republicans think senior Trump advisers had improper dealings with Russia MORE regularly attacks media as ""fake news.""

On Sunday, the debate raged on as conservatives doubled down on perceived bias in the so-called mainstream media and the president's son mocked an editor for defending the industry.

Both the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. have tried to capitalize on the media’s mistakes this weekend in an attempt to discredit journalists. Trump on Sunday blasted the ""out of control"" media for being ""a stain on America,"" while Trump Jr. slammed news outlets for not contacting him in their reporting.

""If they were really trying to get to the truth you would think they would reach out to the other side before running with it. They all have my number... they couldn’t care less about the truth,"" Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter.

Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2017

Several news organizations, including two top cable networks, were recently forced to issue corrections to articles related to the investigation into Russia’s election meddling and potential ties between Trump campaign staff members and the Kremlin.

The mistakes provide additional fodder for Trump's claim that the media is overhyping the investigation into Russia's election meddling, a concern also raised on Sunday shows.

The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, a prominent conservative writer, suggested during a Sunday interview on Fox News’s “Media Buzz” that “the real scandal” could be journalists ""perpetuating"" the ""Russia-Trump collusion narrative.""

Her remarks follow CNN's Friday correction to a story that originally said Trump Jr. received an email from WikiLeaks presenting hacked documents with Democratic information on Sept. 4, before WikiLeaks made them public. The cable news outlet corrected the story, clarifying that Trump Jr. received the email on Sept. 14, after WikiLeaks had already published the documents.

“It turned out that it was, like so many other stories that we’ve gotten on this narrative, a complete nothing burger,” Hemingway said of the CNN report.

The mistakes have provided ammunition to the president, who has since the 2016 campaign railed against “fake news” and what he views as biased reporting.

“Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”),” Trump said Saturday.

“Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?”

The president was referring to ABC News correspondent Brian Ross, who in a report earlier this month said former national security adviser Michael Flynn would testify that Trump directed him to contact Russian officials during the campaign.

The network later corrected the story and suspended Ross, noting Trump told Flynn during the campaign “to find ways to repair relations with Russia and other hot spots,” and instructed him to make contact shortly after he won the 2016 election.

But the inaccurate report had already pushed U.S. stocks into a downward spiral, causing Trump to later suggest that individuals who lost money in the stock market over the report should consider suing ABC News.

“It set a media narrative based on a lie. That’s the problem,” former Trump campaign aide David Bossie told “Media Buzz” on Sunday.

Bossie argued that the media has an agenda against Trump that fuels inaccurate reporting.

“They can’t help themselves. They hate this president. They will never let him succeed,” he said.

Bossie also slammed Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel, who apologized Saturday after tweeting out a photo of an empty arena hosting a Trump rally that was taken hours before the event began.

“We have story after story after story of fake news,” Bossie said.

ABC and CNN both earned criticism from within the industry over their errors, but not everyone in the industry views the mistakes in a negative light.

David Frum, an editor for The Atlantic who was formerly a speechwriter to President George W. Bush, argued Sunday that the reporting mistakes are why readers should trust journalists.

“The mistakes are precisely the reason the people should trust the media,” Frum told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.”

Frum argued that journalism is a process, saying that readers gradually consume news over time to discern the truth.

“In the process, there are going to be overshoots and undershoots,” Frum said.

The mistakes, however, have only fueled Trump's attacks on the media.

Similar to his line of attack after CNN and ABC made their mistakes, the president on Saturday went after Weigel after he apologized for the misleading photograph.

“.@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when, in fact, he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.). FAKE NEWS, he should be fired,” Trump said.","trump donald john trumphouse democrat

Jordain Carney,Partisan tensions are mounting on the Senate Judiciary Committee.,2017-12-10T15:30:01Z,the-hill,"Senators clash over direction of Russia, Clinton probes",http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/364049-senators-clash-over-direction-of-russia-clinton-probes,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/feinsteindianne_grassleychuck_120817getty.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Partisan tensions are mounting on the Senate Judiciary Committee, with both parties accusing the other of stonewalling.



The panel's investigation into the 2016 election appears to have hit the skids, with members increasingly fighting over the direction of the probe.

Republicans want to dig back into Obama-era scandals, including the FBI’s handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGrassley blasts Democrats over unwillingness to probe Clinton GOP lawmakers cite new allegations of political bias in FBI Top intel Dem: Trump Jr. refused to answer questions about Trump Tower discussions with father MORE’s private email server.



But Democrats say the committee should be focused on potential collusion between President Trump's campaign and Russia, as well as the circumstances of former FBI Director James Comey’s firing.



They are publicly questioning whether Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyGrassley blasts Democrats over unwillingness to probe Clinton GOP and Dems bitterly divided by immigration Thanks to the farm lobby, the US is stuck with a broken ethanol policy MORE (R-Iowa), the chairman of the committee, is really willing to look into the Trump administration, including on potential obstruction of justice.



“[Republicans have] walked away from this issue and have tried to divert public attention, sadly, to tell us, 'well let’s go back and investigate Hillary Clinton again,' which is their common refrain. I’m disappointed,” said Sen. Dick Durbin Richard (Dick) Joseph DurbinDemocrats turn on Al Franken Minnesota's largest newspaper calls on Franken to resign Democratic senator predicts Franken will resign Thursday MORE (D-Ill.).



Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon WhitehouseOvernight Regulation: Net neutrality supporters predict tough court battle | Watchdog to investigate EPA chief's meeting with industry group | Ex-Volkswagen exec gets 7 years for emissions cheating Overnight Energy: Watchdog probes Pruitt speech to mining group | EPA chief promises to let climate scientists present their work | Volkswagen manager gets 7 years for emissions cheating EPA head pledges to protect climate scientists MORE (D-R.I.) also pounced on a New York Times story that referenced an anonymous GOP senator saying the president had urged them to open up a separate probe into Fusion GPS — the firm tied to a controversial research dossier on Trump.



“Who is this Republican Senator ‘nudged’ by the White House? Is this why full Judiciary hearings have veered in this direction instead of Russia/obstruction?” he said in a tweet.



Top Democrats on the panel — including Sens. Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel FeinsteinGrassley blasts Democrats over unwillingness to probe Clinton Avalanche of Democratic senators say Franken should resign Blumenthal: ‘Credible case' of obstruction of justice can be made against Trump MORE (Calif), the ranking member — want to subpoena Donald Trump Jr. for his testimony on a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on Clinton. Democrats also want to know more about Trump Jr.’s contact with WikiLeaks, which published Clinton’s leaked emails.



Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent Grassley a letter urging him to subpoena Trump Jr. “immediately.”



Under the committee rules, a subpoena would take either a majority vote of the panel or an agreement between Grassley and Feinstein.



But Grassley appeared to downplay the need for Trump Jr. to publicly testify immediately, stating he was being “fully cooperative” with committee staff and Democrats were still requesting information.



“We need to get what documents [Democrats] need, in order to make a determination [of] if we need to talk to him in an open hearing, but so far, if there’s additional questions, and I understand there is from one of the Democrat members of the committee, I’m willing to cooperate with them and help them get that information,” he said.



Grassley added that he asks Democrats to “take that route first because they need that information in order to make a hearing … successful.”



That answer isn’t likely to sit well with Democrats, who are already concerned about the pace of the Judiciary Committee’s work.



“I think the urgency and pace of our investigation into obstruction of justice and other issues relating to the Department of Justice should be increased,” Blumenthal said when asked about the committee’s overall investigation.



Though Feinstein became the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee this year, she and Grassley have worked together for years, largely on international narcotic issues. They’ve also publicly praised each other since they started working together on the panel.



Sen. John Cornyn John CornynMcConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees Air Force makes criminal reporting changes after Texas massacre We need a better pathway for allowing civilians to move guns across state lines MORE (R-Texas), a member of the committee, said the current split between the two senators on the 2016 investigation was “to be expected,” but noted that Grassley and Feinstein generally work well together.



“They’re both terrific people and I think on one of the most polarized committees in the Senate, it’s a pleasure,” he said.



Feinstein, who is up for reelection in 2018 and facing a progressive primary challenger, has come under criticism from the left for her work with Grassley. Some also say she hasn’t used her high-profile Senate perch to speak out loudly enough against Trump.



Grassley, meanwhile, has long been respected in Congress for his commitment to congressional oversight.



But tensions have been simmering on the committee’s Russia investigation for months.

Grassley sent a barrage of letters tied to Comey’s firing and Russia’s election meddling without Feinstein, and, separately, appeared to move toward probing the Obama-era Uranium One deal.



Days letter, Feinstein said she would start her own investigation that would focus on potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia as well as potential obstruction of justice by Trump.



Since then Feinstein has sent nearly 20 letters, including requests this week for communications director Hope Hicks, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and longtime Trump aide Keith Schiller to agree to an interview with Judiciary Committee staff.



Asked about Grassley’s decision to not sign onto the letters, Feinstein told reporters this week that she believes “there’s an effort … not to go deeply” into the administration.



“And I hadn’t realized it before, but realize it now, and we’re going to have to find a way to deal with it,” she said.



Her comments came after she told NBC’s “Meet the Press” following national security adviser Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators that what she was “beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice.”

Still, Feinstein hasn't signed onto many of Grassley's recent letters, either, including ones related to the FBI's handling of the Clinton investigation, Fusion GPS or Uranium One. Grassley says he can't compel people to testify without her, and noted Feinstein has specifically told him that she won't help probe Clinton's emails.



Grassley said he believes his committee’s investigation is still bipartisan because both Republican and Democratic staff members are able to participate in the closed-door interviews with witnesses.



“What we generally do, just so you know, there is bipartisan cooperation, is if she wants to submit letters, she submits them to us gives us a period of time to decide do we want to sign on. Sometimes we sign on, sometimes we don’t. We do the same thing [for her],” he said.



He added that, “when we get people up here for questioning, if she has people for questioning, we participate in it, and when we have people for questioning they participate in it. ... So you know the cooperation is going on.”



A staffer, who was standing next to Grassley, added that staffs had interviewed several witnesses just based off letters Grassley sent in October and “there’s a good amount of cooperation.”



Blumenthal, asked if he had concerns about Grassley’s leadership of the panel, also defended the Iowa senator as a “straight shooter.”



“His record shows he is dedicated to uncovering wrongdoing. He’s a great protector of whistleblowers. I’m hopeful that he will be interested in hearing from Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Democrat slams Donald Trump Jr. for ‘serious case of amnesia’ after testimony Skier Lindsey Vonn: I don’t want to represent Trump at Olympics Poll: 4 in 10 Republicans think senior Trump advisers had improper dealings with Russia MORE [Jr.] talk under oath,” he said.



But Grassley also fired back at Democrats on the committee, including Feinstein by name, during a more than half-hour floor speech. He accused them of holding up the committee’s investigation and being unwilling to look into Clinton or Fusion GPS.



""There is a double standard here in the way that they desperately want to go after the president but ignore all other potential wrongdoing in the previous administration,"" he said, adding that Democrats have “visions of impeachment dancing in their heads.”



He added that the Judiciary Committee, to be credible, has to look both at the FBI's handling of the Clinton email case and Trump’s possible ties to Russia.



""It looks like there was a rush to clear [Clinton]. It looks like the fix was in. I know the Democrats don't want to hear that. ... It stinks to high heaven, but Democrats have visions of impeachment dancing in their heads,"" he said.



Feinstein declined to respond to Grassley’s speech, saying she hadn’t seen it. But Durbin, asked how Democrats could move around Grassley, admitted they likely couldn’t.



“They’re in control,” he said, “[so] until the majority control changes or their view changes we’re stuck.”","hillary clinton hillary diane rodham clintongrassley

Jones and his campaign spent Sunday working with top black Democratic surrogates around the state in a unified effort to drum up support. This included an afternoon campaign stop in Birmingham with Alabama Democratic Rep. Terry Sewell and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerGOP and Dems bitterly divided by immigration Dems put hold on McFarland nomination over contradictory testimony: report Corker: McFarland's nomination 'frozen' over contradictions in her testimony MORE, and events held down state by Congressional Black Caucus members Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) and Rep. Cedric Richmond Cedric Levon RichmondThe nearly 60 Dems who voted for impeachment House rejects Democrat's resolution to impeach Trump Black Dems see bias in response to sexual harassment cases MORE (D-La.).

Sparking strong black voter turnout has been an integral part of Jones’s strategy as he hopes to score an upset victory over Moore in Tuesday’s Senate special election.

Jones leads the polls with black voters by huge margins, thanks in no small part to his role prosecuting men who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church during the Civil Rights Movement. But it remains unclear whether the unified effort will be enough to change Tuesday’s outcome in such a deep-red state.

“Will we now raise up the echoes and let people know that democracy is not a spectator sport? You can’t sit on the sidelines and cheer for teams to win. You have to get into the game, it is a full-contact, participatory endeavor,” Booker told a crowd in front of the Jones campaign headquarters in Birmingham.

“The opposite of justice is not injustice, it is inaction, it is indifference, silence. We have to remind people that faith without works is dead.”

Before arriving at the office in downtown Birmingham, which sits a block away from the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and several doors down from black-owned barber shops and the Civil Rights Activists Committee, Jones finished a Sunday swing through a group of black churches in Birmingham.

Canvassers poured out of the Jones campaign office in downtown Birmingham to hear Jones, Sewell and Booker speak, with the crowd outside chanting along with those who made it inside the small building.

Jones supporters say Sunday’s push is indicative of the attention the Democrat has given to turning out the key parts of his base, which includes minority voters as well as moderates who may be turned off by the controversial Moore, who has faced allegations of sexual misconduct.

“I think that Doug Jones has built the coalition that I dream for Democrats to go and make a comeback,” said state Rep. Anthony Daniels, who serves as the Democratic leader in the state House.

“They’ve built a really good coalition that reflects the state of Alabama and its diversity.”

Jones’s success prosecuting the 16th Street Baptist Church bombers is a central part of his campaign’s messaging.

That grisly crime, which took place in 1963, killed four girls who were inside the predominately black church at the time. The tragedy served as a seminal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.

Law enforcement officials initially closed the investigation into the bombing without any charges, so the perpetrators were prosecuted in subsequent decades. Jones handled the case for the final two men responsible for the bombing.

In addition to his role in the bombing case, ""kitchen table issues"" and the various allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against his opponent also play important roles in Jones’ messaging to black voters.

That messaging hasn’t been all about Jones — the campaign has also highlighted Moore’s comments on race to help push turnout. Last week, Jones blasted Moore in light of a new focus on September comments the Republican made arguing that America was last great “at the time when families were united, even though we had slavery.”

“With his extreme views and divisive rhetoric, Roy Moore would be incapable of representing all of the people of Alabama,” Jones spokesman Sebastian Kitchen said in a statement.

But with the expected turnout in an off-year special election to be low, at least compared to an election year, it remains to be seen whether Jones can turn out enough black voters to win.

Black voters make up just one-quarter of the state's voting-age population. So while Jones's margin among the voting block can go as high as 70 percent or more in some polls, he'll need a surge of turnout to help pull off the upset.

Complicating that prospect, there has been little as far as a Democratic ground game in the state in recent years to help with basic tasks like voter registration.

And there are concerns among some black activists that some of the Jones campaign’s messaging could turn off black voters, too.

Criticism has centered on a recent mailer that showed a picture of a black man with a skeptical look on his face. Above him, the mailer reads: “Think if a black man went after high school girls anyone would try to make him a senator?”

“Someone, probably a white man, thought that the image would resonate with black people and motivate them to get out the vote,” wrote Michael Harriot, a staff writer at The Root.

“The flyer is reductive in its oversimplification of the black mind as only caring about black issues. While it might not be racist, it is certainly racist adjacent.”

The controversy led to Jones being asked about it during an interview on SiriusXM’s Joe Madison Show late last week.

“That mailer kind of speaks for itself. You know, maybe we could’ve used a little bit different language,” Jones said.

He went on to frame the election as a choice between Moore, who he said is “not a credible person,” and Jones’ record.

“[I have] done my part to make sure that we have social justice and nondiscrimination in this state. And, that we treat everybody with dignity and respect,” Jones said.","congressional black caucus members rep sanford bishop dga

Taking on major figures in her own party has bolstered the New York Democrat’s standing as a voice for change in the nation’s reckoning over sexual harassment and misconduct, which is reshaping society.

But it has also won her criticism.

ADVERTISEMENT

Supporters of Clinton blasted Gillibrand as disloyal for her statements about Clinton, with some noting how the Clintons supported her over the years.

Those sympathetic to Franken suggested it was craven for her to be the first out with a statement Wednesday calling for him to resign, and suggested she was both seeking attention and building her brand on a fallen progressive hero.

Gillibrand has won headlines with her action that could be useful if she chooses to run for president in 2020 against what could be a crowded field.

Others said the moves could actually hurt her in a primary, where loyalists to Clinton and Franken will have long memories.

“All this reeks of is political opportunism and that's what defines Kirsten Gillibrand's career,” one Democratic strategist said. “Why wasn't she talking about Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonMueller’s probe doesn't end with a bang, but with a whimper Mark Mellman: History’s judgment Congress should massively ramp up funding for the NIH MORE when he was helping her during her various races for the House and Senate? And would she be talking about Bill Clinton today if Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGrassley blasts Democrats over unwillingness to probe Clinton GOP lawmakers cite new allegations of political bias in FBI Top intel Dem: Trump Jr. refused to answer questions about Trump Tower discussions with father MORE was president? I think we all know the answer.”

When it came to Franken, Gillibrand was “twisting in the wind until the goose was cooked and then saw an opportunity,” the strategist added.

Brent Budowsky, a longtime Democratic aide and columnist for The Hill, acknowledged that the New York senator has played a “leading role against sexual abuse … which is very positive and admired."" But he said behind the scenes, “there are some Democrats who did not appreciate the way she went after Bill Clinton.”

He suggested the pressure on Franken helped Democrats gain the high ground against Republicans, but that it also won her criticism from some in the party.

Some of the criticism has been public and harsh.

Hours after she told The New York Times that the president should have resigned, Hillary Clinton’s longtime communications adviser, Philippe Reines, took to Twitter to blast her.

“Ken Starr spent $70 million on a consensual blowjob. Senate voted to keep [President Clinton]. But not enough for you @SenGillibrand?” Reines tweeted. “Over 20 yrs you took the Clintons’ endorsements, money and seat. Hypocrite. Interesting strategy for 2020 primaries, best of luck.”

This week, Matt Lewis, the Daily Beast columnist, called the senator “the most devious and cunning politician in America today.”

“It’s a woman who took Hillary Clinton’s seat, who sucked up to the Clintons for decades, and then totally turned on Bill Clinton and Hillary by the way, when the opportunity presented itself,” Lewis said on CNN. “I have no doubt that she actually does care about this issue but I think Al Franken was pretty good friends with her at one point. Now she’s turned on him. She’s stepping on a lot of people and maybe she might make it all the way to Pennsylvania Avenue in the process.”

Those close to Gillibrand insist she wasn’t trying to make headlines on either Clinton or Franken.

They say as someone who was dealing with sexual harassment issues for years, she felt an obligation to draw a red line — even if it had to deal with one of her colleagues.

The confidants emphasize that she wasn’t trying to be “judge and jury,” as one put it.

When Franken gave his speech, Gillibrand got teary-eyed and in the hours after his resignation, she felt terrible, the confidants say.

Asked about her comments, a Gillibrand adviser referred The Hill to a Facebook post written by the senator earlier this week.

In the post, Gillibrand talked about the decision she made to step forward and ask her colleague to resign from office.

“But this moment of reckoning about our friends and colleagues who have been accused of sexual misconduct is necessary, and it is painful,” she wrote in the lengthy post. “We must not lose sight that this watershed moment is bigger than one industry, any one party, or any one person.”

Some Democrats commend her for taking the lead on an issue that wasn’t gaining traction in recent weeks. Democratic strategist David Wade said Gillibrand “has made herself inseparable from the national conversation” on sexual harassment.

“It certainly positions her as a generational leader for women politicians in the Democratic Party,” Wade said. “It's a gamble in the short term. If you wind up with a Republican winning Franken's Senate seat while Roy Moore ends up in the Senate, some people are going to say that she put her ambitions ahead of the interests of her caucus.""

Moore is the Alabama GOP candidate for the Senate accused of predatory behavior toward a number of teenage girls.

“But the sexual harassment issue isn't going away, especially if Moore wins and Democrats force the Republican Party to wear Roy Moore like an ugly Christmas sweater,” Wade continued.

“Her voice is going to automatically be relevant in the years ahead.”

Grant Reeher, the director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said the criticism of Gillibrand “doesn’t ring true to me.”

“If this were some calculated, inauthentic move to position herself for 2020, it’s a strange tactic to take, in pursuit of her party’s nomination,” Reeher said, adding that Gillibrand has been “staking out this area of expertise and interest for many years and has built much of her Senate career around it.”

“She has been a leading spokesperson in the chamber for women’s issues and women’s rights and it’s not surprising to me at all that she would be one of the first Democrats to call out Sen. Franken and when the conversation inevitably turned to him, President Clinton,” he said.

But one Democratic strategist compared Gillibrand’s recent efforts to a speech former senator Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) delivered at the height of the Lewinsky saga condemning Bill Clinton.

“Lieberman raced to be the first to say publicly what his colleagues were all saying privately, because he saw where the political winds were blowing and he wanted to be Al Gore Al GoreTrump’s isolationism on full display at international climate talks Overnight Energy: Trump officials defend fossil fuels, nuclear at UN climate summit | Dems commit to Paris goals | Ex-EPA lawyers slam 'sue and settle' policy Al Gore: A new president in 2020 could keep US in Paris agreement MORE’s running mate,"" the strategist said.

Gillibrand, the strategist added, “has the same hunger for advancement.”","kirsten gillibrand kirsten elizabeth gillibranddemocrats

Jordan Fabian and Jonathan Easley,The White House believes it is weathering the storm wrought by Michael Flynn’s guilty plea and staff remains optimistic President Trump will survive the Russia investigation that has clouded his first year in office.,2017-12-10T14:45:24Z,the-hill,"In White House, mood is perseverance amid the storm",http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/364010-in-white-house-mood-is-perseverance-amid-the-storm,http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_120517getty.jpg,politics,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The White House believes it is weathering the storm wrought by former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s guilty plea and staff remains optimistic President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Democrat slams Donald Trump Jr. for ‘serious case of amnesia’ after testimony Skier Lindsey Vonn: I don’t want to represent Trump at Olympics Poll: 4 in 10 Republicans think senior Trump advisers had improper dealings with Russia MORE will survive the Russia investigation that has clouded his first year in office.



The mood largely reflects the cool attitude of attorney Ty Cobb, who is telling Trump and his aides the investigation will wrap up by year's end or soon thereafter, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former White House officials and outside advisers in touch with the West Wing.

ADVERTISEMENT

“The feeling now, over the last 48 hours, is very positive,” said one former transition official. “I feel good about it. Everyone I talk to does.”

There is satisfaction within the administration that tax legislation is moving in Congress and that the White House accomplished its campaign goal of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — even as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation moves closer to the White House.



Mueller has come under attack recently by GOP lawmakers, conservative activists and pro-Trump television personalities who accuse his office of being compromised by partisan bias, an effort some in the White House believe is taking its toll on the special counsel’s credibility.

But that sanguine outlook is far from unanimous.

A small, but significant, segment of those in the president’s orbit say it’s wishful thinking that the probe will end soon, reflecting their growing anxiety that Mueller is methodically working his way up the food chain in an investigation that is months — if not years — from completion.



Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon has spoken by phone with Trump to warn him he is receiving a bunch of “happy talk” from his legal team and to urge him to take a more aggressive stance against Mueller, according to someone familiar with Bannon’s thinking.

Even if Mueller does not prove the Trump campaign colluded with Russia’s election meddling efforts in 2016, some allies worry the White House is suffering irreparable political damage under the weight of the investigation.

In addition to exploring the possibility of collusion, the centerpiece of the probe, Mueller’s team is looking into alleged financial crimes committed by Trump campaign aides and possible obstruction of justice.

Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser in the White House, pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. and later said he is cooperating with the special counsel’s team.

It’s an indication Mueller’s probe could stretch well into 2018 and possibly beyond, despite Cobb’s public and private reassurances.

“It’s a political cancer and if you don’t give the patient some chemotherapy, there is a good chance something bad happens,” said one person close to the Trump administration.

Asked about the legal advice Trump is receiving, the person responded, “they’re giving him ibuprofen to cure cancer.”

That frustration with Trump’s legal team — and Cobb in particular — is growing among some critics, who say it is not taking Mueller’s threat to the administration seriously enough.

“The incompetence is staggering,” said one adviser with close ties to the White House.

Cobb did not respond to requests to comment for this story.

Inside the West Wing, it is hard to miss the constant churn of news about the Russia investigation.

High-definition televisions mounted on the walls of West Wing offices show a split screen of four major cable news networks, whose programming is often consumed by the latest Russia-related developments.

But for the most part, aides say they aren’t affected by the press coverage and are staying focused on whatever happens to be the task at hand, according to one White House staffer.

“There’s a numbing effect too,” said a person who is close to the administration. “If you work there, you stop getting bothered by every new thing that’s coming out.”

One former White House staffer called the news reports “background noise for a vast majority of folks.”

New revelations this week about alleged anti-Trump sentiment among some key members of Mueller’s team are driving anger at the special counsel and a sense that his findings will be dismissed as compromised by politics.

Attacks against senior FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was reassigned from the probe, and top Mueller lieutenant Andrew Weissmann for private anti-Trump messages they allegedly sent are being amplified every night to conservative audiences tuning into Fox News.

“It’s as if the worm has turned with everything that’s being exposed about FBI and the special counsel,” said a former transition adviser who is in touch with White House staff.

While Flynn’s guilty plea last Friday shook Washington, White House staff say they were less surprised because the guilty plea, for making false statements to the FBI, was far short of what many expected.

There is a sense of optimism that the former national security adviser will be the biggest fish Mueller nets.

“I just really do think we’re in the last month or months of this and it’s going to be all over,” said former Trump adviser Barry Bennett.

The escalating pace of developments surrounding the special counsel investigation, however, has at times been an added stressor in a tumultuous year for White House staff.

There has already been considerable turnover among senior staff, and the White House is bracing for another potential exodus at the end of the year.

That wave will include Dina Powell, Trump’s deputy national security adviser and one of the most well-regarded members of his team, who the White House announced Friday will leave in the coming weeks.

Some junior White House staffers feel overworked, a symptom of having to pick up duties at agencies, from the Department of Energy to the State Department, that the administration has been slow to staff, according to outside advisers.

“The White House nomination process is a black hole,” said one adviser.

And there is concern that Trump’s tendency to shoot from the hip on Twitter and during impromptu press gaggles will land him and his team in further legal jeopardy.

The White House was forced to scramble into damage-control mode after Trump tweeted last Saturday that he fired Flynn for lying to Vice President Pence and the FBI.

Legal experts said the tweets could be used by Mueller’s team in building an obstruction of justice case against the president.

Hours after the tweet appeared, Trump attorney John Dowd said he wrote it, a claim that, if true, could limit the president's legal exposure.

Many of Trump’s closest friends, such as Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, are warning him to stay out of it and focus instead on muscling through his legislative agenda.

“The best approach for the president, in my opinion, is to drive his popularity by creating a bipartisan consensus on such things as infrastructure, education and other matters,” Ruddy said in an email. “Trump has the ability to be a great unifier, and popular presidents are not removed from office.”","trump donald john trumphouse democrat

""Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!"" Trump tweeted.

Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2017

The president's tweet comes after various journalists became targets of Trump and his supporters last week over a series of reporting errors.

The errors by CNN and ABC have been widely covered in the media, including on CNN, which featured a Sunday segment on mistakes in journalism.

Trump referred to ABC News's Brian Ross as a ""fraudster"" on Friday, a week after he reported that Trump had directed his former national security adviser Michael Flynn to make contact with Russian officials during the campaign.

ABC later corrected the report to say the president directed Flynn to contact Russia after he was elected.

Trump also took aim at CNN after the network was forced to make a correction on Friday regarding documents Donald Trump Jr. received from WikiLeaks.

""Oh thank you, CNN, thank you so much. You should have been apologizing for the last two years,"" Trump said to laughter and cheers at a rally in Florida.

Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel became Trump's most recent target on Saturday after the president demanded that he apologize for tweeting a photo of an empty arena before a Trump rally in Florida that had been taken hours before the event started.

Weigel responded and apologized minutes after Trump tweeted that he had ""put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived.""

Trump has since called for the Post to fire Weigel.","trump donald john trumphouse democrat

A Gravis Marketing poll finds Moore has 49 percent support in the Alabama Senate race, while 45 percent back Jones.

Another 6 percent of respondents in the poll are undecided. Of those who are undecided, 24 percent say they are leaning toward supporting Moore, 27 percent say they are leaning toward Jones and nearly 50 percent are uncertain.

Moore is facing accusations of sexual misconduct from multiple women.

A woman accused Moore of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and he was 32. Other women have also come forward to allege Moore had inappropriate contact with them when they were teenagers.

Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations.

In a similar poll released earlier this month, Jones had a 4 point lead over Moore.

The latest poll was conducted from Dec. 5 to 8 among 1,254 likely voters. Its margin of error is 2.8 points.

“But these allegations are completely false. I did not date underaged women. I did not molest anyone. And so these allegations are false,” Moore said during an interview with The Voice of Alabama Politics, a television news show affiliated with the website The Alabama Political Reporter.

Moore in an interview last month after the initial set of accusations admitted he may have dated women in their later teens during that time in his life.

“Not generally, no. If I did, I’m not going to dispute anything but I don’t remember anything like that,” Moore told Sean Hannity during an interview on his radio show when asked about dating women “as young as 17.”

The age of consent in Alabama, both at the time of Moore’s alleged pursuit of the women and today, is 16.

Moore has specifically denied knowing Leigh Corfman and Beverly Young Nelson. Corfman told The Washington Post that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old, and Nelson came forward after the initial Post story saying Moore assaulted her when she was 16.

“I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone. And for them to say that, I don’t know why they’re saying it, but it’s not true,” Moore told The Voice of Alabama Politics.

Moore in the interview with Hannity acknowledged that he remembered two of the women, Debbie Wesson Gibson and Gloria Thacker Deason, who both spoke to The Washington Post for the newspaper’s first story. Gibson told the Post that she was 17 years old when Moore asked her out, while Deason said she went out with Moore when she was 18.

In the latest interview, Moore continued to deny any allegations of molestation.

“I said I did not know any of the women who have charged me with sexual allegation of molestation. And I did not know any of the women,” Moore said. “When I saw these pictures on the advertisements of my opponent, I did not recognize any of those people. I did not know them.”

His campaign has argued the accusations are politically motivated and has questioned the timing of the allegations, the first of which were revealed about one month before the Alabama special election.

Moore, who will face off against Democratic candidate Doug Jones on Tuesday, initially lost the support of multiple Republican lawmakers due to the allegations.

But some members of the GOP have appeared to soften their tone regarding Moore. After President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Democrat slams Donald Trump Jr. for ‘serious case of amnesia’ after testimony Skier Lindsey Vonn: I don’t want to represent Trump at Olympics Poll: 4 in 10 Republicans think senior Trump advisers had improper dealings with Russia MORE offered Moore a full-throated endorsement last week, the Republican National Committee reinstated its fundraising agreement with Moore’s campaign.

The network reported that an unnamed FBI agent had informed one of Sessions' aides in an email that ""he was not required to list foreign government contacts while in official government business unless he developed personal relationships from such contacts.""

The statement was in response to a question from one of Sessions' aides that was sent in March.

The report backs up the DOJ's explanation for not including his foreign contacts on his security clearance application form.

CNN first reported in May that Sessions did not disclose his meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the SF-86 form.

DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told CNN at the time that an FBI employee who was helping Sessions complete the form advised him that he did not have to disclose meetings with foreign ambassadors that took place during his time in the Senate.

Democrats had previously knocked Sessions for omitting the contacts on the form.

The report comes as multiple congressional panels and special counsel Robert Mueller continue to probe alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.","jeff sessions jefferson jeff beauregard sessionsgop

Winter had arrived in Buffalo.

The teams adjusted to the blizzard conditions as one would expect, celebrating sacks not with choreographed dances, but rather with snowball fights.

The snow accumulated so much that, by the fourth quarter, the Colts had to clear the ground so their kicker Adam Vinatieri could hit the extra point.

Vinatieri and the Colts did complete the extra point, tying the Bills at 7, and sending the battle into overtime. The score was essentially 0-0 again, but within the hearts of the Bills burned the fire of a thousand dragons.

With 1:40 remaining in overtime, Bills running back LeSean McCoy broke through the Colts’ defensive wall like the flame of Viserion, giving the Bills the walk-off win.

This win gives the Bills a winning record of 7-6, while the Colts felt further to 3-10.

However, the real winners were the fans, because like “Game Of Thrones,” if you’ve survived till the end, that’s quite an accomplishment.","😂pictwittercomtz1bp4cujv

As of Sunday, the massive fire has burned more than 173,000 acres and destroyed more than 500 structures in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties since sparking last Monday. At just 15 percent containment, it continues to threaten more than 15,000 structures.

The blaze grew nearly 20,000 acres overnight, forcing new evacuations for parts of Montecito and Carpinteria. It also impacted power lines, leaving at least 85,000 Santa Barbara residents without power on Sunday.

So far, officials have confirmed one death associated with the fire. The National Weather Service warned Sunday of poor air quality in the region and encouraged people to stay inside and avoid strenuous activity if possible.

It’s possible the Thomas Fire will move up in the rankings in the coming days, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ― also known as Cal Fire ― said Sunday.

On Cal Fire’s list of the state’s 20 largest fires, which uses records dating back to 1932, the Thomas Fire is the only blaze to occur in December, with nearly every other record fire burning during the hot, summer months. But with years of record-high temperatures and devastating drought leaving the state’s forests tinder-dry, fires have become a threat all year long.

Gene Blevins / Reuters Fire fighters attack the Thomas Fire’s north flank with backfires as they continue to fight a massive wildfire north of Los Angeles, near Ojai, on Dec. 9, 2017.

“It’s December, and it’s amazing to be able to say we aren’t out of fire season,” Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott said at a new conference on Saturday. “And this is the challenge that we face in California and certainly here in Southern California, that it is a year-round challenge that we are all in.”

That’s the “new reality” for California, Gov. Jerry Brown also said Saturday, calling the state a “very wonderful place, but a place that’s getting hotter” as global temperatures rise.

Gene Blevins / Reuters Flames spread in a valley from a Santa Ana wind-driven brush fire called the Thomas Fire near Ventura, California, on Dec. 5, 2017.

“And we know from the changing in the climate that it’s going to exacerbate everything else,” Brown said, echoing climate scientists’ warnings that California’s highly variable climate will only become more vulnerable to wildfires and other natural disasters.","california department of forestry

Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Sunday she believes any woman who has felt violated or mistreated by a man has every right to speak up, even if it is President Donald Trump they are accusing.

Accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior or misconduct have led to the resignations of three members of Congress this month. The growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men from Hollywood to Washington, from movie producer Harvey Weinstein to popular television personality Matt Lauer.

More than 10 women have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct before he was president, and Trump, while filming a segment of the television program “Access Hollywood,” said he has kissed and groped women. The tape emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Haley, discussing a cultural shift of women coming forward on the CBS “Face the Nation” program, applauded women who have come forward: “I’m proud of their strength. I’m proud of their courage.”

Asked how people should assess the accusers of the president, Haley said, it was “the same thing.”

“Women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with, and I think we heard them prior to the election,” she said. “I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way - they have every right to speak up.”

Whether Trump’s election settled the matter was “for the people to decide,” Haley said.","harvey weinstein

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard at Jerusalem’s main bus station on Sunday, police said, and violence flared near the U.S. Embassy in Beirut over U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

Four days of street protests in the Palestinian territories over Trump’s announcement on Wednesday have largely died down, but his overturning of long-standing U.S. policy on Jerusalem ― a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians ― drew more Arab warnings of potential damage to prospects for Middle East peace.

“Our hope is that everything is calming down and that we are returning to a path of normal life without riots and without violence,” Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Army Radio.

But in Jerusalem, a security guard was in critical condition after a 24-year-old Palestinian man from the occupied West Bank stabbed him after approaching a metal detector at an entrance to the city’s central bus station, police said. The alleged assailant was taken into custody after a passer-by tackled him.

In public remarks on Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a frequent critic of Israel, called it an “invader state” and a “terror state”.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who spoke at a news conference in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after the two leaders met, fired back:

“I’m not used to receiving lectures about morality from a leader who bombs Kurdish villages in his native Turkey, who jails journalists, helps Iran go around international sanctions and who helps terrorists, including in Gaza, kill innocent people,” Netanyahu said.

Macron told Netanyahu that he needed to make gestures to the Palestinians to break the impasse between the two sides.

“I asked Prime Minister Netanyuhu to make some courageous gestures towards the Palestinians to get out of the current impasse,” Macron said, suggesting that a freeze of construction in settlements could be a first step.

Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory and say the status of the city should be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks. Israel says that all of Jerusalem is its capital, while Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.

The Trump administration has said it is still committed to reviving Palestinian-Israeli talks that collapsed in 2014, but jettisoning old policies is necessary to break the deadlock.

Washington says it has not taken a position on Jerusalem’s final status or borders, but it is sensible to recognize that any future peace deal will have Israel’s capital in the city.

The United States was “as committed to the peace process as we’ve ever been”, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday. Trump “didn’t talk about boundaries, he didn’t talk about borders... Because the final status of Jerusalem is between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It’s not for the Americans to decide.”

Netanyahu reacted to critics in a statement before talks with Macron, to be followed by a meeting with European foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.

“I hear (from Europe) voices of condemnation over President Trump’s historic announcement, but I have not heard any condemnation for the rocket firing against Israel that has come (after the announcement) and the awful incitement against us,” Netanyahu said.

DEMONSTRATIONS

In Beirut, Lebanese security forces fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters, some of them waving Palestinian flags, near the U.S. Embassy.

Demonstrators set fires in the street, torched U.S. and Israeli flags and threw projectiles towards security forces that had barricaded the main road to the complex.

In the Moroccan capital, Rabat, tens of thousands of protesters marched down the city’s main thoroughfare chanting slogans including, “The people want to liberate Palestine” and “Death to Israel, enemy of the people and provoker of wars.”

Waving Palestinian flags and holding up pictures of Jerusalem, they expressed anger at they “betrayal” by Arab governments perceived to have backed Trump’s move.

In the Indonesian capital Jakarta, thousands protested outside the U.S. embassy, many waving banners saying “Palestine is in our hearts”.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki has said the Palestinians will be looking for a new peace talks broker instead of the United States and would seek a United Nations Security Council resolution over Trump’s decision.

Arab foreign ministers who met in Cairo on Saturday urged the United States to abandon its decision on Jerusalem and said the move would spur violence throughout the region.

Echoing that view, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, said the U.S. move “could throw a lifebuoy to terrorist and armed groups, which have begun to lose ground” in the Middle East.

GAZA TUNNEL

Along Israel’s tense frontier with the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military on Sunday destroyed what it described as a “significant” cross-border attack tunnel dug by the enclave’s dominant Islamist group, Hamas.

There was no immediate comment from Hamas on the demolition, which came as Palestinian factions tried to meet Sunday’s deadline for an Egyptian-mediated handover of Gaza by Hamas to Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas after a decade’s schism.

Pre-dawn Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip on Saturday killed two Palestinian gunmen after militants fired rockets from the area into Israel on Friday.","prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed alnahayan

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is calling on President Donald Trump to resign over the more than a dozen sexual misconduct allegations against him.

Booker made the comments Saturday during a campaign event in Alabama to support Doug Jones, the state’s Democratic candidate for Senate. Jones is engaged in a tight race against embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore, whose campaign has been dogged by sexual misconduct accusations.

Booker told VICE News that the sexual harassment allegations against Trump are “far more damning” than the claims against Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who on Thursday announced his resignation from office after multiple women accused him of groping them.

“I just watched Al Franken do the honorable thing and resign,” Booker said. “My question is — why isn’t Donald Trump doing the same thing? Who has more serious allegations against him, with more women who have come forward.”

While Trump has been quick to call out other high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks, including Franken and Matt Lauer, who was fired from NBC’s “Today” show over sexual assault allegations, he’s refrained from applying the same level of scrutiny to his own behavior.

At least 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, including forcible kissing and groping, since the 1980s. He even bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” in 2005 on the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” tape.

Trump denied the allegations throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and dismissed the “Access Hollywood” recording as merely “locker room talk.” In October, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested all the women accusing Trump of sexual harassment were lying.

Booker’s comments follow a call by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) that Trump should resign.

“The president should resign because he certainly has a track record with more than 17 women of horrific conduct,” Merkley said on Thursday.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted on Thursday that Trump should “think about resigning,” a point he reiterated on Sunday during NBC’s “Meet The Press.”

We have a president who acknowledged on tape that he assaulted women. I would hope that he pays attention to what's going on and think about resigning. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 7, 2017

As lawmakers push for Trump’s record of alleged sexual misconduct to be re-examined, the president is working to get Moore elected in the Alabama Senate race. Despite his swift condemnation of Franken, Trump has endorsed Moore, a man accused of making sexual advances toward teenagers when he was in his 30s decades ago.","sarah huckabee sanders

Jerry Brown (D) toured some of the destruction left by unrelenting wildfires across his state on Saturday and warned that climate change is creating a “new normal” for natural disasters.

“We’re facing a new reality in this state, where fires threaten people’s lives, their property, their neighborhoods,” and cost “billions and billions of dollars,” he said at a news conference alongside emergency officials.

“This could be something that happens every year or every few years. It happens to some degree. It’s just more intense, more widespread. We’re about ready to have firefighting at Christmas,” he said. “This is very odd and unusual. But it is the way the world is with the kind of carbon pollution that we’re not only living with but that we’re generating still.”

Justin Sullivan via Getty Images Gov. Jerry Brown urged people to ""do more, not less"" to help eliminate the effects of climate change.

As of Sunday, an estimated 200,000 acres in and around the Los Angeles area remain ablaze. The largest of the infernos, the Thomas Fire in Ventura County, has grown to more than 173,000 acres. It is so far 15% contained, according to Cal Fire’s website.

“It’s a time to do more, not less,” Brown said. “Fires, floods and earthquakes don’t go away.”

Brown in 2015 issued a similar warning after wildfires destroyed nearly 70,000 acres in northern California. He called that blaze a “wake up call” for the entire state. Since then, the state has experienced some of the biggest and deadliest fires in its history.

Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott on Saturday also blamed changing environmental conditions for exacerbating the flames. He noted that though Southern California is no stranger to the warm Santa Ana winds that have helped fan the fires, the intensity of the gales is highly unusual.","gene blevins reuters

At least five children have died while waiting for medical care, according to the agency.

Escalating violence in East Ghouta, roughly six miles east of Damascus, has cut off food supplies and medical aid to an estimated 400,000 Syrians since 2013, the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported Sunday.

“As violence continues to intensify in East Ghouta, thousands of children are suffering in silence,” Fran Equiza, the UNICEF representative in Syria, said in a statement. “The situation is getting worse day by day.”

The 137 children requiring medical evacuation range in age from 7 months to 17 years and suffer from a variety of conditions, including kidney failure and severe malnutrition.

UNICEF called on “all parties” in the Syrian conflict to allow “unconditional” humanitarian access to the country’s children. Aerial bombings have destroyed hospitals and neighborhoods, which has contributed to the spread of disease and malnutrition.

According to UNICEF, nearly 12 percent of East Ghouta’s children under 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition ― the highest rate recorded since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011.

At least 400,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Children have accounted for nearly 1 in 4 civilian deaths, according to a study conducted by epidemiologists at the Universite Catholique de Louvain in Brussels.","universite catholique de louvain

Luke O'Brien,"Inside the antifa movement's struggle to continue its long, colorful legacy of cracking white supremacist heads without alienating, well, just about everyone.",2017-12-10T19:57:38Z,the-huffington-post,The Nazi-Puncher's Dilemma,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazi-punch-antifa_us_59e13ae9e4b03a7be580ce6f?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F59ef52e1180000051bdfbf5b.jpeg%3Fcache%3DqhhFU208KK&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=e394eef4fc9034bf8d8b9ad4e729bc47e4e22a66,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"WASHINGTON ― There is a growing desire in this country to punch Nazis in the face. At least, this is what I hear from people who punch Nazis in the face. Some gleefully send me videos of other people punching Nazis in the face, such as the one from September featuring a Nazi in Seattle who threw a banana at a man and, in return, ate a very professional right cross. The Nazi fell to the ground and lay there unconscious. When he came to, he removed his Nazi armband and shuffled off.

Anyone following the news knows who’s doing the bulk of this Nazi-punching: “antifa.” It’s an esoteric and often confounding term. Although short for “anti-fascist” — an expansive category that one would imagine includes millions of Americans — “antifa” has quickly come to connote a very specific stereotype: a black-clad, violent, leftist subversive.

Most Americans first learned about antifa in February, when what looked like a gang of ninjas set fires and broke windows to stop Milo Yiannopoulos, a race-baiting former Breitbart News editor, from speaking on the University of California, Berkeley campus, where he reportedly intended to out undocumented students. About a week after the deadly white supremacist riot in Charlottesville, Virginia, President Donald Trump seized on antifa as Exhibit A in his ongoing efforts to blame “both sides” for the violence. During a speech in Phoenix, Trump played up the word’s alien vibrations as if he were, to borrow a Trevor Noah joke, introducing a band at the Latin Grammys: “An-TEE-fa!”

Their notoriety may be new, but antifa have a long, complicated history of militant community activism. This history has involved a lot of Nazi-punching, but it’s also about much more than that. In the course of my reporting on the alt-right over the past year, I’ve talked to several older anti-fascists who have been doing the “work” for decades. They told me about pitched battles in the street with Nazis from another era, about raiding Klan rallies under cover of darkness, about cops in cahoots with white supremacists, and about Nazis torching the homes of activists and killing antifa in the desert. I heard about duffel bags filled with barbells and knives and a legendary anti-fascist who was attacked by a brass-knuckle-wielding Nazi and responded by breaking the fascist’s teeth with a Maglite flashlight. These exploits sounded fantastical, but when I looked into them, they were true.

The antifa vets were more strategic than I anticipated and obsessively knowledgeable about politics. They all had extreme personalities, although time had precipitated out a little of their tannin. Some had children and normal lives. The Maglite legend, I’d heard, was now a kids’ soccer coach. Still, they were tight-lipped about their activities, some of which were illegal, and were often misunderstood.

Anti-facism is a loose-knit, decentralized movement containing numerous organizations and ideologies that even insiders struggle to explain. For starters, not all people who identify as anti-fascists describe themselves as antifa. Most antifa are anarchists, but there are also socialists and communists, who divide further into Maoists, Marxists, Trotskyists and Stalinist “tankies.”

What unites them is a belief that dangerous elements of the far right must be driven from the public square, even if by force. And for two decades, beginning in the mid-1980s, that’s what antifa attempted to do, almost entirely out of the public eye. They put neo-Nazis and other white supremacists on their heels in cities and suburbs around the country, forcing many of them underground or into retreat. (Other contributing factors: litigation by civil rights organizations, the demise of key white supremacist leaders and law enforcement roundups.)

Over the past year, as fascists and racists have reemerged, emboldened by the rise of Trump, many old-school antifa have laced up their boots again. But now they find themselves facing a new enemy. The current crop of neo-Nazis and white nationalists prefers tattersall to tattoos and come off more like Young Republicans than Hammerskins. They are proficient in social media and online messaging, which presents a challenge for antifa used to fighting in the shadows.

“When you have Richard Spencer getting punched in the face, millions of people see it,” said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. Millions of people might also feel a pang of sympathy for Spencer. Others might use the video to demonize the left or justify a crackdown on public protest. In an age of insta-propaganda, it’s hard to know: Is punching Nazis actually helping the Nazis?

If New Orleans gave us jazz, Minneapolis gave us antifa. Gangs of skinheads scrapping in cold Midwestern alleys — that’s how organized anti-fascism in America was born, in the counter-culture punk scene of the 1980s. The skinheads listened to ska and punk and wore steel-toed Doc Martens and Fred Perry shirts. The original skinhead movement was multiracial and working class, and it drew heavily from Jamaican “rude boy” culture. But in the 1980s, white power groups invaded the scene, giving rise to thousands of “boneheads” — neo-Nazi skinheads.

In Minneapolis, one bonehead set called the White Knights started beating up minority kids and menacing leftists in the punk rock crowd. It was stomp or get stomped, and a multiracial crew of “traditional” skins called the Baldies decided to fight back. The Baldies’ turf was the Uptown neighborhood. If the Baldies caught Nazis in Uptown, they’d tell them to leave. If the Nazis didn’t leave, the Baldies put a hurt on them. The White Knights cleared out of Uptown. Before long, they cleared out of Minneapolis.

Unknown The original Baldies in Minneapolis in the 1980s.

In 1987, the Baldies joined with other leftist and anarchist activists to form Anti-Racist Action, which would become the mother organization for anti-fascism in America. The ARA focused not only on neighborhood Nazis but also on systemic racism. “We go where they go” was the ARA’s first guiding principle, and the organization’s tactics evolved beyond fisticuffs. ARA members painted over racist graffiti and disrupted the sales of white power music. They put out political literature, held demonstrations and did door knocks, volunteered in schools to educate kids about racism, protested wars and did environmental activism and labor organizing. One of the ARA’s priorities was defending reproductive rights. Members regularly stood guard outside abortion clinics, which the far right menaced with Nazi muscle.

The ARA also pioneered a tactic known today as doxing — exposing fascists and racists in order to shame them in their communities. Back then, it was a lot more labor-intensive. “When you see someone passing out white supremacist flyers or not getting prosecuted for hate crimes, you dig deeper and try to find out who the person is,” explains an anti-fascist in western Pennsylvania with two decades of experience who goes by Lady. “We would make a list of their actions against our friends, neighbors and the community. We’d write it into a little story and put it on a flyer with a picture of them we’d usually have to snap ourselves. Then we’d walk around their community and put the flyer on light poles and cars. We’d usually call it something like, ‘Meet your neighborhood racist.’”

To ARA members, there was no point expecting help from the cops, many of whom antifa knew were themselves racist. And they dismissed liberals as the same kind of pearl-clutching appeasers who’d allowed Hitler and Mussolini to seize power in the 1930s. Antifa would go it alone. By 1998, ARA reportedly had more than 100 chapters and 2,000 members across North America, as well as several newspapers and a hotline to receive tips about white supremacists. Its policy on fascists was simple: Don’t allow white supremacists any platform to normalize a violent ideology. As Gerry Bello, a longtime member of Columbus ARA in Ohio, put it: “Hitler himself said the only way you could have beaten us if you’d smashed us off the street from the very first day and with the utmost brutality.”

These are fights involving weapons. Sometimes one of them will catch a right proper boot party. There’s quite a few times where if we wanted to put them in the morgue they would be in the morgue.

Antifa weren’t exaggerating the threat of violence. Many remember the night in 1998 when two women lured Dan Shersty and Lin “Spit” Newman, two ARA members, into the desert near Las Vegas. Instead of a party, the young antifa found a group of neo-Nazis. According to media accounts, Shersty was barely out of his car when a gun blast opened up his chest. The fascists dragged Newman deeper into the desert and shot him to pieces. Only one of the neo-Nazis, John “Polar Bear” Butler, was convicted of the murders. Another person later took a plea deal.

The violence, however, cut both ways. Although antifa tended to show more restraint on the battlefield, they still put plenty of Nazis in the hospital. “Shit happens,” Bello explains. “These are fights involving weapons. Sometimes one of them will catch a right proper boot party. There’s quite a few times where if we wanted to put them in the morgue they would be in the morgue.”

Perhaps the first time that antifa really entered public view was during the protests against globalization at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, when a small contingent of masked anarchists in black famously smashed up police cars and the windows of corporate offices in acts of “symbolic violence.” (Many antifa view capitalism as an engine of systemic racism.) The “Battle of Seattle” was essentially the American debut of the “black bloc” tactic, which was first used in Germany. The idea was that if the entire bloc dressed in black and wore masks, a few activists could vandalize property and then blend anonymously back into the ensemble, making it almost impossible for police to figure out whom to arrest. From that point, black bloc became the de facto uniform for antifa when they deployed in large groups.

Like they did in York, a small blue-collar city in south-central Pennsylvania and the site of a historic antifa victory.

In 2002, Matt Hale, the leader of a major white supremacist organization, the World Church of the Creator, staged a rally in a mostly black and Latino part of York. His purpose was to support York’s mayor, Charlie Robertson. At the time, Robertson was under investigation for his connection to a murder that occurred during a deadly race riot in York in the 1960s. Robertson would later admit that while serving as a police officer during the riot, he had shouted “White power!” to an angry mob. He had also allegedly supplied ammunition to white gang members and told them to “kill as many niggers as you can.” The gang members shot a black woman to death. None of them was ever charged — but a deathbed confession by one of the gangsters almost 30 years later had finally exposed Robertson’s involvement.

Hale’s rally drew well over 100 white supremacists to York. Antifa showed up in equivalent or greater numbers, according to multiple participants. As the anti-fascists walked into York, local black teenagers emerged from their homes, ready to join them in battle. Antifa helped them don masks, according to one activist who was there. This is what antifa say they work hardest to achieve: a community empowered to defend itself, with anti-fascists playing a supporting role.

Hale was speechifying inside a library, with bonehead foot soldiers posted outside. Riot police and state troopers were there to keep the peace. But when smaller groups of Nazis began slipping off to the side of the library, antifa pursued them through alleys with the guidance of the locals. “It broke up into several small unit combats all over the city for hours,” Bello says. “They have this thing, I’ve only seen it in York. You know those old metal garbage cans? They had this way to skip them off the ground and have them come up at teeth height.”

A large group of antifa turned into an alley. Chain-link fence on the left. Brick wall on the right. About 80 feet away down the alley was a cluster of Nazi skinheads. Antifa charged straight for them. A Nazi in a pickup came flying down the alley, according to newspaper accounts and two anti-fascists who were there. He hit two antifa, breaking a teenage girl’s arm and raking another person down the fence for 20 feet, then screeched out of the alley and bounced a girl as young as 8 off his bumper. To leave town, the white supremacists needed an armed escort from the police for almost a mile.

Antifa put the boot to neo-Nazis in other cities, too, such as Toronto, and in the suburbs and edge towns of major metropolises like Columbus, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit and Louisville. Heidi Beirich, an extremism expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center, noted that Rose City Antifa’s aggressive tactics in Portland, Oregon, drove the dangerous founder of a murderous neo-Nazi gang out of town. They also went after the Klan, often with similar results. By the mid-2000s, with organized white supremacy seemingly on the wane, the ARA national network began to atrophy. People moved on, settled down, shifted their energy to other causes or retired. Then along came Trump.

The alt-right might have been active before 2016, but Trump’s candidacy ushered a new generation of white supremacy onto the national stage. Not since Nixon has a president so openly courted fascists and racists.

Antifa I spoke with have reported an uptick of new, younger members in response. And older members are swinging back into action, too, either actively or in quieter, supporting roles. “We got motherfuckers coming up out of the bathroom tiles like ‘Terminator 2,’” Bello says. ARA chapters have reorganized across the country, and other groups, such as Redneck Revolt, a pro-worker, anti-racist organization with almost 30 branches nationwide, have readied for action.

But while the alt-right might have copped its ideology from old-guard neo-Nazis and Klansmen, many of its leaders are savvy propagandists. And antifa violence is easy for them to exploit, especially when inflicted upon preppy antagonists.

“To a large extent, the narrative within antifa circles is kind of machismo. It’s about winning battles against the Nazis,” says Cas Mudde, an extremism expert and professor at the University of Georgia. “If you actually beat up 25 big, bulky skinheads, the battle has been won. If you beat up Polo-wearing kids in the suburbs, what have you achieved?”

One ill-considered punch can now obscure the more meritorious blows. Already faded from collective memory are episodes like the one in Charlottesville when antifa fought off baton-wielding white supremacists who were about to attack a line of clergy. (“Antifa saved my life twice on Saturday,” said Rev. Seth Wispelwey, a local minister.) Far more potent are the viral videos, like the one of antifa in Berkeley flattening a MAGA bro. They allow conservatives to brand all antifa as dangerous extremists — in part to create a convenient alibi for their own more dangerous extremists.

And far-right extremists are far more dangerous. A report from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point found that from 1990 to 2012, far-right extremists were responsible for 670 fatalities, 3,053 injuries and 4,420 violent attacks in the United States. No such data exist for antifa, but in the three decades of antifa’s organized existence in America, only one known fatality caused by a member of an antifa group has been recorded, when in 1993 a multiracial skin shot a Nazi skin during a fight at a gas station in Portland and was convicted of manslaughter.

Nevertheless, Trump and others frequently portray the violence as an equal problem on “both sides.” In an ouroboros of political dishonesty, right-wingers have even taken to attacking antifa with comparisons to the most toxic elements of the Republican base. In August, Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former staffer for the racist Sen. Jesse Helms, wrote that antifa are “no different from neo-Nazis.” In September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions likened antifa to the Ku Klux Klan. And then there are extremists such as Gavin McInnes, a Vice co-founder and the leader of the Proud Boys, a Trump-supporting racist “fraternity,” who consistently tries to brand anti-fascists as “fascists.”

Less than a week after antifa stepped in to protect clergy from violent fascists and white supremacists in Charlottesville, a White House petition was created to declare antifa a terrorist organization. It garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures within days. (The Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama had reportedly already classified antifa’s activities as “domestic terrorist violence.”)

At the end of November, Christopher Wray, the FBI director appointed by Trump after the president fired James Comey, told the House Homeland Security Committee that the bureau was investigating a number of people “who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology.”

By then, far-right propagandists had been smearing antifa for months. Many of them, including Lucian Wintrich, a Gateway Pundit writer who is credentialed by the White House and pals around with white supremacists, hyped a conspiracy theory about how antifa “supersoldiers” planned to mass-decapitate white parents and start another American civil war. An official magazine of the National Rifle Association published a scare story that depicted antifa as brutal thugs and claimed that “when the TV cameras are absent, the far left secretly agrees with [the] goals” of this “violent, disgusting and destructive” movement.

“If you just look at the discourse today within Breitbart or the NRA or even Tucker Carlson, they make the case that these are the storm troopers of the Democratic Party,” Mudde says. “It is very problematic in that it distracts from the alt-right, which is already a bit of a distraction from the structural racism in the Republican Party.”

Some antifa elect to pursue nonviolent tactics as a matter of both practicality and public relations. Daryle Lamont Jenkins runs One People’s Project, which does deep research into the organizational networks and funding sources of the far right. To Jenkins and other like-minded activists, information warfare is more important than ever as the alt-right tries to insinuate itself into the conservative establishment and the political mainstream. Jenkins has also pulled several Nazis out of the movement and helped rehabilitate them.

You have to choose between what makes you feel better and what is actually right and effective.

One of Jenkins’ longtime colleagues, Laura Sennett, takes it a step further. Sennett is a photographer and middle-aged Jewish suburbanite who lives in the Washington area. She got into activism after covering a neo-Nazi rally in Toledo, Ohio, that turned into a riot. “Sometimes when I want to shock people, I say, ‘I’m an antifa,’” she tells me. ”And they look me up and down. I’ve got my regular clothes and my nails and my perfume. I look like an art teacher,” she says. “But if I tell people I’m anti-fascist, I get, ‘Oh, that’s wonderful! More power to you.’”

Sennett tries to connect with white supremacists and change how they see the world. The self-described “antifa yenta” has, for instance, baked cookies for Richard Spencer and tried to sprinkle different ideas into his diet. She is critical of violence for violence’s sake, particularly what she calls the “fuck shit up” culture among Berkeley antifa. “Their anti-fascism is becoming a tool for fascism. You have to choose between what makes you feel better and what is actually right and effective.”

But activists like Sennett and Jenkins are a minority. “I have been shunned by people in the antifa community because I suggested a diversity of tactics that weren’t the standard,” Sennett says. “We’ve got to do something that’s violent or vandalism. And for some reason if you do anything that diverts from these kinds of tactics, you’re a traitor.” (Her approach hasn’t helped her avoid attention from law enforcement: In 2008, the FBI raided Sennett’s home and seized her computers, cameras and memory cards, seeking pictures she’d taken of an anarchist demonstration.)

If the militant antifa I spoke to were concerned that social media could be used against them, they didn’t elaborate. “No matter how good we are, it’s going to happen anyway. We’re going to get vilified,” Bello says. Some antifa argued that fisticuff videos simply attract more supporters to their cause. White nationalists made the same argument. Spencer has called the punch he took a good thing because “it woke up the whole movement” and pushed the alt-right into a new gear.

But antifa, too, were in a different gear, with new ARA chapters and other organizations forming around the country. Militant vets view the fight against white supremacists as a war. “I don’t see those two groups standing across from each other 10 to 15 times more and there not being significantly more violence,” Mudde says. “And then we have a different situation.”

So what, ultimately, does one old antifa head think is to be done about the scrubbed-up, boy-next-door alt-right? What, in other words, should he do about Pepe?

Jonathan Cohn,Three years of progress are ending as a reversal begins.,2017-12-10T13:00:55Z,the-huffington-post,"Republicans Can't Kill Obamacare, So They're Turning It Into Trumpcare",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-changes-obamacare-trumpcare_us_5a2aecece4b069ec48ad2337?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2aedc9190000be3503554e.jpeg?cache=x9hnhyldl0&ops=1910_1000,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Republicans haven’t figured out how to kill the Affordable Care Act. But they are transforming it into a weaker, less efficient and more dysfunctional version of itself.

They’ve been at it since the very first days of Donald Trump’s presidency, when officials in his administration canceled advertising for the final week of open enrollment for coverage at healthcare.gov. At the time, they justified it as a cost-cutting move, although the dollars were a pittance and internal research, which later became public, showed that earlier advertising had boosted enrollment.

Now GOP lawmakers are on the verge of taking a more visible and potentially more consequential step. The tax cut bill Senate Republicans passed earlier this month would eliminate the individual mandate, a key piece of the program’s architecture that requires people to get insurance or pay a penalty to the government. If final legislation includes the same provision, and if the legislation becomes law, then fewer people will have insurance and premiums will be higher, according to experts in and outside the government.

The cumulative effect of Republican changes to Obamacare won’t be tantamount to repeal. That’s largely because of the Affordable Care Act’s other core elements: tax credits for people buying insurance on their own, regulations on who and what insurers must cover, and special federal funding for expanded state Medicaid programs. As long as those rules are in force and as long as that money keeps flowing, the insurance system that President Barack Obama and the Democrats created in 2010 will continue to put decent, affordable coverage within the reach of millions.

But the health care landscape already looks a lot different than it did when Obama left office. In many states, old problems with insurance markets have become worse, while new problems have appeared. Rules for Medicaid are changing in ways that make it harder to get on and then stay on the program. The number of people without insurance has started to creep up, and, following this year’s open enrollment period, which ends Friday, it’s likely to rise more significantly.

If the transformation continues, it could work out just fine for some Americans. In some cases, it might even seem like an improvement. But for the country as a whole, it would almost surely mean worse access to care and more financial hardship from medical bills. After three years of progress, the country would be backsliding.

How Private Insurance Is Changing

The most well-publicized changes of the last year have affected private insurance for people who buy coverage on their own rather than through employers.

The Affordable Care Act reorganized this troubled part of the insurance market by requiring carriers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions ― and then setting standards for coverage of 10 “essential” benefits, including mental health, maternity care and prescriptions. To make sure plans are affordable, the law introduced tax credits for anybody with an income below four times the poverty line, or $98,400 for a family of four. The law created the mandate to make sure healthy people sign up, which ensures that insurers have enough money to pay bills for their sicker customers.

The transition to the new system has been difficult. When the law took effect in 2014, insurers canceled old plans (despite Obama’s “keep your plan” vow) and charged higher premiums for new ones. Consumers who qualified for little or no financial assistance felt the brunt of it. For the next few years, the majority of insurers lost money, largely because they weren’t attracting healthy people in the numbers they’d expected.

But in states like California, where officials were fully committed to the program’s success, the new markets have mostly worked smoothly. And by 2016, most carriers were finding their way to profitability. Although plenty of people continued to struggle with high premiums or out-of-pocket costs, millions had decent, affordable coverage they could not get before. And there were credible ideas on the table, from the likes of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, to help the rest.

Then Trump took over, unleashing a campaign of neglect and sabotage. He stopped paying a series of special payments to insurers that were the subject of a legal dispute. Insurers raised premiums in response. And that initial reduction in spending on healthcare.gov ads turned out to be a harbinger of more sweeping cutbacks ― not just on advertising but also on the official “navigators” and “assisters” that the Affordable Care Act authorizes to help sign up new customers. Those groups are now operating at lower capacity, which means they’ll enroll fewer people.

Until this year, getting people to shop for coverage was a priority for the federal government, with Obama personally promoting enrollment through venues like the comedy show “Between Two Ferns.” Trump, by contrast, has declared the law “finished” and “dead.” Seema Verma, chief administrator at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hasn’t issued a single tweet through her official account encouraging people to investigate their options ― even though, as Politico’s Dan Diamond observed, she sent out multiple messages encouraging seniors to check out their options for Medicare next year.

The people for whom advertising makes a difference tend to be the ones who don’t think about insurance because, at least for the moment, they are healthy. That’s a problem for insurance companies, who need those customers ― and it’s going to be an even bigger problem if the mandate goes away.

Economists have historically considered the mandate essential to a well-functioning market system, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that, without the mandate, the number of people buying private coverage on their own would drop by 5 million and premiums for these people would rise by 10 percent as insurers adjust for a customer base more tilted toward people with serious medical problems.

It’s possible that estimate is high, and CBO may yet revise that prediction downward. As HuffPost’s Jeffrey Young reported Saturday, not every insurer faces the same kind of market ― or is likely to react in the same way. But changes to the mandate are bound to interact with other changes soon to come.

Any day now, the Trump administration will unveil a proposal to change the regulation of short-duration insurance plans. These are plans that don’t typically include mental health or other essential benefits the Affordable Care Act requires, and they are almost never available to people with pre-existing conditions ― which means insurers can sell them for a lot less money.

Once the Affordable Care Act took effect, the Obama administration decided short-term plans would not count toward satisfying the individual mandate and that, as of this year, they could last no more than three months. As with so many other decisions the Obama administration made, this was both an effort to protect people from insurance that would leave them exposed to catastrophic medical bills as well to make sure insurers selling comprehensive, regulated plans weren’t losing healthy customers to cheaper alternatives unavailable to the sick.

The Trump administration plans to alter those rules, and, although the details are not public, it’s likely that the plans will officially be available for up to a year, as they were previously, and that they will count toward the mandate, if the mandate still exists. If healthy people can buy these plans for longer than three months and can do so without incurring a financial penalty from the mandate, many more are likely to choose that option ― causing insurance markets to deteriorate even more as premiums for comprehensive policies go up and more people seek out cheaper, if less secure, alternatives.

How Medicaid Is Changing

It’s through the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid that the majority of newly insured Americans have found coverage. The expansion offered states extra money if they’d open up the program to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line. Thirty-two states plus the District of Columbia have done that.

Now that progress is in jeopardy. Republicans want to end federal funding for the expansion because, they say, Medicaid should only be for a few narrow classes of people: children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities. Republicans also want to reduce federal spending on Medicaid more generally, because they say the program costs too much. The long-term goal is to do all of this through legislation. For now, the Trump administration is making headway by using its executive authority to scale back the program, bit by bit.

Federal law sketches out the basics of the Medicaid program, including who and what it must cover. But states can apply for waivers from some of these requirements and, in order to save money, they frequently seek to serve fewer people or provide them with weaker guarantees of coverage.

The Obama administration tended to look upon such applications skeptically, arguing they violated Medicaid’s federal guidelines. In March, the Trump administration announced it would look upon such applications more favorably. Already the Trump administration has approved several state requests to eliminate what’s known as “retroactive eligibility,” under which Medicaid pays the prior three months of medical bills for newly enrolled people who would have been eligible during that time. It’s a way to reimburse the hospitals, clinics, and other health care providers who take care of people who show up without insurance. It’s also a way to protect people who are eligible for Medicaid, but don’t realize it until they get sick.

Going forward, the Trump administration has also said it will approve state requests to impose work requirements on Medicaid. This is a big issue for Republicans who say that government-financed health insurance should be conditional upon having a job or actively looking for one. As it happens, that’s already true for the majority of people on the program ― and of that small percentage who are not working or seeking work, a substantial proportion are busy caring for relatives, according to studies. But imposing work requirements reliably reduces enrollment, partly by adding one more layer to the application and qualification process, making it more difficult to get on and then stay on the program.

A less obvious way the administration and its allies are scaling back Medicaid is by trying to take away the mandate, which creates an expectation that everybody should have insurance, prompting people to investigate their coverage options. Inevitably, some portion discover they are eligible for Medicaid, which is essentially free. This was very much how the Affordable Care Act’s architects hoped the program would work. But it means more people end up on Medicaid, and that’s not what Republicans want.

Who Will Get The Blame

It’s impossible to be certain how all of these changes, taken together, would play out. But one possibility is that private insurance markets in much of the country would split into two groups, as observers like Duke University’s David Anderson and Vox’s Dylan Scott have sketched out in the last few weeks.

Here’s how it’d go: As premiums go up, the tax credits would too, guaranteeing a lucrative market that at least some insurers would always want to serve. People who qualify for those credits would continue to have comprehensive coverage available at reasonable prices. And they represent the majority of people buying insurance on their own.

But the tax credits aren’t free. They come out of the federal treasury, which means that, ironically, Republican efforts could mean more federal spending to maintain the subsidized markets. More important, the people who don’t qualify for tax credits ― the ones with incomes that are more than four times the poverty line ― would increasingly find comprehensive, regulated coverage simply unaffordable, even more so than they do today.

Some would react by figuring out ways to reduce their income in order to get just below the subsidy threshold. The rest would seek out cheaper alternatives, like those short-term plans and “health care ministries,” in which Christians share each other’s medical bills. These options, although generally better than no coverage at all, provide less reliable protection from medical bills, as writers like Julie Appleby of Kaiser Health News and Laura Turner of BuzzFeed have detailed.

For people who don't qualify for subsidies, markets in some states could look like they did before the Affordable Care Act.

For people who don’t qualify for tax credits, the market for insurance would look a lot like it did before the Affordable Care Act took effect ― with coverage that works primarily for people who are in good health and stay that way. “I think we could get to that point relatively quickly in some markets,” Sean Mullin, a senior director of the consulting firm Leavitt Partners, told HuffPost. “This isn’t 10 years off. This could be the case next year.”

A lot would depend on where people live. States including California and Maryland where officials are most committed to expanding health insurance would probably continue doing what they do now: promote enrollment aggressively, using their regulatory powers to restrict plans that don’t live up to the Affordable Care Act’s standards, and maybe even creating their own versions of the individual mandate. These states would be unlikely to seek the Medicaid waivers that the Trump administration is so eager to grant.

It’d be a different story in the places where officials are seeking to limit or even undermine the Affordable Care Act’s reach. A handful of states, such as Iowa, already have deeply damaged markets ― with premiums that are way too expensive for most people who don’t qualify for subsidies ― and Medicaid programs that have been weakened. If Republicans continue to remake the Affordable Care Act as they have so far, more states will be in the same situation.","trump administration

WASHINGTON — Senator Richard C. Shelby, a fixture of Republican politics in Alabama for a generation, sent a clear message to his home state on Sunday when he said on national television that the party could “do better” than elect Roy S. Moore to the state’s other Senate seat in two days.

Mr. Shelby, appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” stopped short of endorsing Mr. Moore’s Democratic opponent in the special election, Doug Jones, noting that he had written in the name of a “distinguished Republican” on his absentee ballot.

But his decision to air his opposition to Mr. Moore on national television so close to the election added an exclamation point to an extraordinary break from the norms of modern party politics. Mr. Shelby pointedly declined to recommend that his fellow Republicans back their nominee in the tight race — a man Mr. Shelby would have to work with in the Senate if he is elected.

“I understand where the president is coming from. I understand we would like to retain that seat,” Mr. Shelby said, referring to President Trump’s endorsement of Mr. Moore despite accusations of sexual misconduct involving teenagers.

“But I tell you what, there’s a time, we call it a tipping point,” Mr. Shelby continued. “I think, so many accusations, so many cuts, so many drip, drip, drip. When it got to the 14-year-old’s story, that was enough for me.”","shelby

The state is so often stellar in football, residents say ruefully, and not much else, a consequence of generations of bitter fights, political turbulence and eternal divides over race and class.

About 17 percent of Alabamians live in poverty — the fifth-highest rate in the country — and the state’s violence-wracked prisons are jammed to 159 percent of their intended capacity. With budget troubles a chronic fact of life, spending on Medicaid, which has not been expanded, lags. Standardized test scores are among the nation’s lowest. Heart disease and diabetes are endemic.

Last year, Marion, a rural city in central Alabama, suffered a tuberculosis outbreak so severe that its incidence rate was worse than that of many developing countries.

The infant mortality rate for 2016 rose to 9.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, the highest rate the state has seen since 2008. (The national rate was 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, the most recent year for which federal data is available.) The mortality rate was more than twice as high for black infants as white ones, and in some parts of the state, like Perry or Pickens Counties, the rate was 25.6 and 30.3.

“I think we really don’t know why it’s going up,” said Grace Thomas, the assistant state health officer for family health services with the state’s Department of Public Health, who called the rates a “key indicator of a health care system’s effectiveness” and said black, Hispanic and poor women were less likely to get the care they need.

Paris Daves, 24, said it took her several months after she found out she was pregnant last year to get on Medicaid, although she has since drawn support from an organization called Gift of Life, which works to prevent infant mortality in Montgomery. But as a young, single parent, there are other problems, too, like unreliable public transportation and low wages.

“Minimum wage here is $7.25,” said Ms. Daves, who earns a dollar more than that as a shift manager at McDonald’s. “That’s not enough to pay my rent or take care of my son.”

In Haleyville, northwest of Birmingham, the coming shutdown of the hospital looms over the city where, in 1968, the country’s first 911 call was made.

But you can pick anyplace in Alabama and find issues that feel somewhere between daunting and suffocating. In the Black Belt, named for its rich topsoil, but now a region of widespread rural poverty, people still wonder whether once-plentiful jobs will ever come back.

Along the Black Warrior River in Tuscaloosa, professionals and university professors worry about Alabama’s reputation and whether companies with money to spend might look elsewhere. Indeed, many fear that the ultimate fallout from the race will be yet another hit to the state’s reputation and attractiveness as a place to do business.

Huntsville cares about federal spending that helps power an economy that depends on rockets and missiles.

National reporters flocked to a town hall last month in Gadsden hoping for animated discussion of Mr. Moore and the Senate race. Instead, most of the conversation was about opioids, economic development and the extension of Interstate 759.

People here know that no single senator can fix all of Alabama’s ills. Many of the state’s troubles, residents acknowledge, must be solved at the State House in Montgomery, not in Washington. But as the campaign for a rare open Senate seat droops to an end that just about everyone here says cannot come soon enough, there is no shortage of regret that the tawdry overtook the tangible, and topics of statewide concern got little hearing.

“There’s really no other way to put it than a missed opportunity,” said Will Walker, a bank president in Haleyville, the largest city in a county where President Trump won 90 percent of the vote last year. “We’ve had so little discussion about issues, it’s disappointing.”

The state, like its neighbors in the South, is desperate to preserve the economic lifeboats that have emerged in recent decades: big-name foreign manufacturers who put down stakes in exchange for cheap labor, low taxes and lavish incentive packages.

The economic model has created a strange dichotomy: While Alabama often generates headlines about culture-war battles that outsiders view as hopelessly provincial, the flavor of commerce is increasingly, and proudly, international.

Airbus, a French company, assembles jets at a state-of-the-art, $600 million factory in Mobile, working with pieces pre-assembled in Spain, Wales, France and Germany. Mercedes-Benz produces luxury SUVs and sedans along Interstate 20 in Tuscaloosa County. Hyundai has been producing vehicles in Alabama since 2005; Honda, since 2001.

But the strategy only works so well. In 1999, according to census figures, Alabama’s median household income lagged the national median by about $7,800. Today, Alabama lags behind the national median by more than $11,000.

Samuel N. Addy, an economist at the University of Alabama, said the state still has glaring public sector needs in education, infrastructure, health and prisons.

“Those are our four major ones,” said Mr. Addy, “and all of them require raising revenues to meet the needs here. But I don’t think the climate is such that we are open to raising revenues much.”

The poor quality of public education, in particular, has long been a concern in a state where the gap between rich and poor residents — and white and black ones — remains a nagging reality.

The concerns have only seemed to mount with the realization that 21st century manufacturing jobs often require advanced understanding of computer systems: Building a jet is just not the same as running a loom. A year ago, then-governor Robert Bentley, a former church deacon not prone to strong language, at least in public, put the matter in shockingly blunt terms: “Our education system in this state sucks.”

In Escambia County, near the Florida border and the site of Alabama’s death row, Laurine Gentry, 37, said she, too, worried about the state’s schools. This year, she said, the area voted to consolidate some schools, and she worries about her kindergartner, who she says has to ride the bus with high schoolers.

“He hears and sees things that maybe he shouldn’t,” she said.

Ms. Gentry, who said her husband is serving a prison term elsewhere in Alabama, also described the state’s deteriorating prisons. Her husband, she knows, can take care of himself behind bars, but she said the strain on the system is obvious to her family.

“My husband’s last probation officer told me he’s sorry he failed me and my children, because he’s got 70 guys to look after, because it’s hard,” Ms. Gentry said.

Indeed, Escambia County is but one place that struggles. Even with the state’s vast presence and a nearby casino, Main Street is sprinkled with shuttered businesses.

“We are 49th or 50th in too many categories,” said Robbie Drummond, 63, a pharmacist. “In Alabama, we always say, ‘Thank God for Mississippi.’ I know they say the same about us.”","state’s department of public health

WASHINGTON — Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said on Sunday that the women who have accused President Trump of sexual misconduct “should be heard,” a break from the administration’s assertions that the allegations have no merit and should be dismissed.

In response to questions on CBS’s “Face the Nation” about the allegations, Ms. Haley said that while ultimately the decision on Mr. Trump lies with voters, “women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.”

In discussing the growing number of women coming forward with stories of sexual misconduct by an array of powerful men, Ms. Haley said there should be no differentiation in how they are treated, regardless of whom they are accusing.

“They should be heard, and they should be dealt with,” Ms. Haley added. “And I think we heard from them prior to the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.”

During the 2016 presidential campaign, more than a dozen women accused Mr. Trump of sexual harassment, claims that he recently dismissed as “totally fake news” and “made-up stuff.” The president is seeking to block a defamation lawsuit filed by one of his accusers in New York State Supreme Court.

Asked in October if the administration’s official position was that the women were lying, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, echoed the president’s statements. “Yeah, we’ve been clear on that from the beginning, and the president’s spoken on it,” she said.","new york state supreme court

For most of the year, people inside and outside Washington have been convinced that there is a strategy behind Mr. Trump’s actions. But there is seldom a plan apart from pre-emption, self-defense, obsession and impulse.

Occasionally, the president solicits affirmation before hitting the “tweet” button. In June, according to a longtime adviser, he excitedly called friends to say he had the perfect tweet to neutralize the Russia investigation. He would call it a “witch hunt.” They were unimpressed.

He has bowed to advice from his lawyers by not attacking Mr. Mueller, but at times his instincts prevail.

When three former campaign advisers were indicted or pleaded guilty this fall, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the investigation, urged the president not to respond. If he did, it would only elevate the story.

Mr. Trump, however, could not help himself. He tweeted that the financial charges lodged against his former campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort, had nothing to do with the campaign and that investigators should be examining “Crooked Hillary & the Dems” instead. By the next morning, he was belittling George Papadopoulos, the campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his outreach to Russians, dismissing him as a “low level volunteer” who has “proven to be a liar.”

He was calm at first when his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty. The next morning, as he visited Manhattan for Republican fund-raisers, he was upbeat. He talked about his election and the “major loser” in the Senate who had said his tax bill would add to the deficit (presumably meaning Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee).

By Sunday morning, with news shows consumed by Mr. Flynn’s case, the president grew angry and fired off a series of tweets excoriating Mrs. Clinton and the F.B.I., tweets that several advisers told him were problematic and needed to stop, according to a person briefed on the discussion.

Once he posts controversial messages, Mr. Trump’s advisers sometimes decide not to raise them with him. One adviser said that aides to the president needed to stay positive and look for silver linings wherever they could find them, and that the West Wing team at times resolved not to let the tweets dominate their day.

The ammunition for his Twitter war is television. No one touches the remote control except Mr. Trump and the technical support staff — at least that’s the rule. During meetings, the 60-inch screen mounted in the dining room may be muted, but Mr. Trump keeps an eye on scrolling headlines. What he misses he checks out later on what he calls his “Super TiVo,” a state-of-the-art system that records cable news.

Watching cable, he shares thoughts with anyone in the room, even the household staff he summons via a button for lunch or for one of the dozen Diet Cokes he consumes each day.

But he is leery of being seen as tube-glued — a perception that reinforces the criticism that he is not taking the job seriously. On his recent trip to Asia, the president was told of a list of 51 fact-checking questions for this article, including one about his prodigious television watching habits. Instead of responding through an aide, he delivered a broadside on his viewing habits to befuddled reporters from other outlets on Air Force One heading to Vietnam.

“I do not watch much television,” he insisted. “I know they like to say — people that don’t know me — they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources — you know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don’t get to watch much television, primarily because of documents. I’m reading documents a lot.”

Later, he groused about being forced to watch CNN in the Philippines because nothing else was available.","george papadopoulos

Michael D. Shear and Ellen Ann Fentress,"In Jackson, Miss., the president hailed heroes of the civil rights movement even as activists and politicians said his presence insulted the effort to confront the state’s history.",2017-12-09T22:31:25Z,the-new-york-times,"Trump, Rejecting Calls to Stay Away, Speaks at Civil Rights Museum",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/politics/trump-mississippi-civil-rights-museum.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/10/us/10dcTrump-1-web/10dcTrump-1-web-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Paired with a second museum that aims to document the state’s overall history, the civil rights museum has drawn praise from the movement’s veterans as an honest depiction of Mississippi’s past.

Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy, was lynched in 1955 by a white mob in Money, Miss. And one of the most infamous episodes of the civil rights era took place in Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights activists — Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman — were killed while trying to register voters in the summer of 1964.

Those who made a point of skipping the president’s speech — including John Lewis, the civil rights leader and Democratic congressman from Georgia — cited his equivocal remarks after the summer’s racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, Va., and described Mr. Trump’s policies toward Mexicans, Muslims and other minorities as an insult to the museum’s purpose.

At a news conference before Air Force One touched down in Jackson, national activists and local African-American politicians said they were disappointed that the president had chosen to participate in the event.

“Today may be a grand opening, but there will be a grander opening,” said State Senator Sollie Norwood of Jackson, who declined to attend Mr. Trump’s speech. He said he was looking forward to seeing the museum after the president left. “That will be the day that all of us will walk in.”

Amos Brown, the longtime pastor of the historic Third Baptist Church in San Francisco, listed a number of times Mr. Trump had failed to speak up for civil rights causes.

“Since Donald Trump did not show up when we needed him to speak a word on behalf of blacks who have experienced police brutality,” Mr. Brown said, “he does not deserve to be in Jackson for the celebration of the civil rights museum.”

About 200 protesters assembled along Jackson’s streets, hoping to turn their backs on Mr. Trump’s motorcade as it made its way to the downtown museum from Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport, named for the black civil rights activist who was shot in the back by a member of the Ku Klux Klan in 1963. But it appeared that the motorcade took a different route.

Myrlie Evers-Williams, his widow, and Charles Evers, his brother, attended Mr. Trump’s speech, despite reports that members of the family might boycott it. Mr. Evers greeted Mr. Trump on the airport tarmac.

Mr. Trump took pains to acknowledge the death of Mr. Evers, calling him a martyr who had fought during World War II and then returned to Mississippi to fight for the “same rights and freedoms that he had defended in the war” by helping to register blacks to vote. For that work, Mr. Trump said, Mr. Evers was “assassinated by a member of the KKK.”

The president recognized Ms. Evers-Williams, whose endorsement of the museum boosted its credibility, calling her “his incredible widow,” and thanking her for carrying on “Medgar’s legacy.” He also thanked the people of Mississippi, a state, he said, “where I’ve had great success.”

Speaking later to a polite and enthusiastic crowd of about 1,800 under a chilly bright blue sky, Ms. Evers-Williams said: “Going through the museum of my history, I wept because I felt the blows. I felt the bullets. I felt the tears. I felt the cries. But I also sensed the hope.”

Presidents are often called on to reflect upon the country’s darker chapters and to inspire a better future. In 2015, President Barack Obama marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., where African-Americans were beaten during “Bloody Sunday” in 1965. Mr. Obama, the nation’s first black president, declared in a speech that despite the progress, the “nation’s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us.”

Mr. Obama occasionally grappled publicly with the country’s racial divisions, especially in the wake of the violence that erupted after police shootings of unarmed black men. Mr. Obama’s earlier comment about a white police officer’s “stupid” arrest of a black Harvard professor led to a “beer summit” in which the three men discussed the state of race relations in the country.

For Mr. Trump, race has been a more inflammatory topic. His campaign was rooted in an appeal to disaffected white voters, and his comments about Mexicans and Muslims have generated accusations of racism. His efforts to impose a travel ban on people from mostly Muslim countries have been declared racist by several federal judges, though the Supreme Court has now allowed a third version of the ban to take effect.

In August, Mr. Trump was widely condemned for saying that “both sides” were to blame for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville when white supremacists gathered to protest the city’s removal of a Confederate statue.

Invited by Mississippi’s Republican governor, Phil Bryant, Mr. Trump attended the event on Saturday in the hopes of helping to unify a country that has been struggling to repair its lingering racial schisms. But if he thought his presence here would prove to be a bridge, he may have been mistaken.

“He’s expressed a blatant and wanton disregard for human rights,” said Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the mayor of Jackson, who skipped the museum’s opening. “He’s done so through the discriminatory policy he implements. He’s done so with respect to a failure to denounce the alt-right.”

Talamieka Brice, who helped lead the protests, said Mr. Trump’s policies and often angry remarks were evidence that the racial divisions of the civil rights struggle have not faded completely.

“The ideology that was the catalyst that keeps people demonizing others, that needs to be in a museum, and Donald Trump is evidence that it’s not,” Ms. Brice said.

Mr. Lumumba said he fully supported the museum but decided to stay away from the opening after being told that he would not be given a chance to speak.

“I would be sitting behind Donald Trump, not saying anything, looking like or appearing as if I was complicit with his representation in a moment like this,” the mayor said.","michael schwerner james chaney

Mr. Trump’s broadside was his latest attempt to discredit the news media as biased against him, an effort that has accelerated after several recent mistakes by news organizations and individual journalists.

Brian Ross, the chief investigative correspondent for ABC News, was suspended this month for four weeks without pay after incorrectly reporting that Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, would testify that Mr. Trump had directed him to make contact with Russian officials while Mr. Trump was still a candidate.

At the rally on Friday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Ross a “fraudster” and noted that the stock market had fallen after the inaccurate report. “You know what he cost people?” the president said. “And I said to everybody, ‘Get yourself a lawyer and sue ABC News.’”

Also on Friday, CNN corrected an erroneous report that Donald Trump Jr. had received advance notice from the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks about a trove of hacked documents that it planned to release during last year’s presidential campaign.

In fact, the email to Mr. Trump was sent a day after the documents, stolen from the Democratic National Committee, were made available to the general public. The correction undercut the main thrust of CNN’s report, which had been seized on by critics of the president.

On Saturday morning, before the posts about Mr. Weigel and the rally photo, President Trump pounced on the CNN correction, tweeting, “Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

He continued: “CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public.”

Mr. Trump’s outburst on Saturday was not the first time he had expressed anger at the news media for its coverage of attendance at his rallies and other events.

After taking office in January, he accused journalists of deliberately understating the size of the crowd at his inauguration and said that up to 1.5 million people were in attendance, a claim that photographs disproved. Analyses of news footage showed that fewer people attended Mr. Trump’s inauguration than President Barack Obama’s in 2009.","democratic national committee

Eric Lipton and Danielle Ivory,An analysis of enforcement data at the E.P.A. shows a substantial drop in activity against polluters when compared to the Obama and Bush administrations.,2017-12-10T15:39:28Z,the-new-york-times,"Under Trump, E.P.A. Has Slowed Down Actions Against Polluters, and Curbed Enforcement",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/us/politics/pollution-epa-regulations.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/08/us/00reg-enforce1/00reg-enforce1-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"In addition, the agency sought civil penalties of about $50.4 million from polluters for cases initiated under Mr. Trump. Adjusted for inflation, that is about 39 percent of what the Obama administration sought and about 70 percent of what the Bush administration sought over the same time period.

The E.P.A., turning to one of its most powerful enforcement tools, also can force companies to retrofit their factories to cut pollution. Under Mr. Trump, those demands have dropped sharply. The agency has demanded about $1.2 billion worth of such fixes, known as injunctive relief, in cases initiated during the nine-month period, which, adjusted for inflation, is about 12 percent of what was sought under Mr. Obama and 48 percent under Mr. Bush.

Resolving complicated pollution cases can take time, and the E.P.A. said it remained committed to ensuring companies obeyed environmental laws.

“E.P.A. and states work together to find violators and bring them back into compliance, and to punish intentional polluters,” the agency said in a statement. Officials said Mr. Pruitt was less fixated on seeking large penalties than some of his predecessors were.

“We focus more on bringing people back into compliance than bean counting,” the statement said.

Confidential internal E.P.A. documents show that the enforcement slowdown coincides with major policy changes ordered by Mr. Pruitt’s team after pleas from oil and gas industry executives.

The documents, which were reviewed by The Times, indicate that E.P.A. enforcement officers across the country no longer have the authority to order certain air and water pollution tests, known as requests for information, without receiving permission from Washington. The tests are essential to building a case against polluters, the equivalent of the radar gun for state highway troopers.

At at least two of the agency’s most aggressive regional offices, requests for information involving companies suspected of polluting have fallen significantly under Mr. Trump, according to internal E.P.A. data.

In the last two complete fiscal years of the Obama administration, the E.P.A.’s office in Chicago sent requests for testing that covered an average of 50 facilities per year, or about 4.2 each month. By comparison, after the policy changes, one such request for a single facility was made in the subsequent four-month period. There was a similar decline in the Denver regional office, according to the data.

The enforcement slowdown has been compounded by the departure of more than 700 employees at the E.P.A. since Mr. Trump’s election, many of them via buyouts intended to reduce the agency’s size, and high-level political vacancies at the E.P.A. and the Justice Department. The agency’s top enforcement officer — Susan Bodine — was confirmed only late last week.

Separately, Mr. Pruitt’s team has told officials and industry representatives in Missouri, North Dakota and other states that E.P.A. enforcement officers will stand down on some pollution cases, according to agency documents. The retrenchment is said to be part of a nationwide handoff of many enforcement duties to state authorities, an effort Mr. Pruitt calls cooperative federalism but critics say is an industry-friendly way to ease up on polluters.

Current and recently departed E.P.A. staff members said the new direction has left many employees feeling frozen in place, and demoralized, particularly in the regional offices, which have investigators who are especially knowledgeable of local pollution threats.

“Certain people who are polluting are doing it with impunity right now and I think it is horrible,” said Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who has worked at the agency for 26 years.

Ms. Cantello agreed to speak to The Times because she is protected by her status as a union official. The E.P.A. did not authorize agency employees to speak.

The Times asked top E.P.A. enforcement officials from the Obama and Bush administrations to review The Times’s data, analysis and methodology. (Read more about The Times’s methodology here.) They said the slowdown signaled a sea change in enforcement under Mr. Trump.

“Those kinds of numbers are stark,” said Granta Nakayama, a lawyer who served in the Bush administration as assistant administrator for the E.P.A.’s enforcement office and who now represents companies facing E.P.A. enforcement actions for the law firm King & Spalding, where he oversees the environmental practice.

“If you’re not filing cases, the cop’s not on the beat,” he said. “Or has the cop been taken off the beat?”

Cynthia Giles, the former assistant administrator for the E.P.A.’s enforcement office during the Obama administration, also prepared a separate version of the data. She described as a “stunning decline” the reduced efforts under Mr. Trump to require companies to bring their facilities into compliance with pollution laws.

“The Pruitt E.P.A. is cratering on the enforcement work that matters most: holding the biggest polluters accountable,” said Ms. Giles, now a director at the Energy & Environment Lab at the University of Chicago.

Some enforcement experts suggested that the E.P.A. under Mr. Pruitt might have filed fewer cases because it was going after larger penalties. But according to the Times analysis, most of the top penalties were smaller than those in the previous two administrations. And the nine-month window included the single largest civil case filed by the E.P.A., against Exxon Mobil.

‘It Really Just Scares Me’

Photo

On a midsummer afternoon in 2013, boiler ash and steam blasted through a breach at the Heritage Thermal Services hazardous waste incinerator, spewing hundreds of pounds of ash into a nearby neighborhood in East Liverpool and setting off a series of small fires at the plant.

Tests later showed that the ash, which looked like dirty clumps of cotton candy scattered across rooftops and lawns, contained toxic chemicals. In some samples, lead and arsenic were found at concentrations that “could pose a hazard to small children,” according to an Ohio Department of Health report. Heritage Thermal went door to door offering to wash people’s houses and replace vegetables in their gardens.

Sandra Estell, 64, who lives on a river bluff overlooking the plant, said the ash covered her brother’s Chevy Blazer and blanketed the street where she grew up. Even when the plant operates normally, she said, she smells the incinerator from her home — with the odor changing from rotten eggs to an electrical fire to something difficult to place.

Truckloads of hazardous waste often sit in the parking lot outside the plant, awaiting disposal. On the day of the accident in 2013, the plant was burning through a load of waste sent from an oil refinery in Toledo.

“It really just scares me,” Ms. Estell said of the incinerator.

The plant falls under the jurisdiction of the E.P.A. regional office in Chicago, which moved quickly to investigate the episode as a possible violation of the Clean Air Act, federal records show.

Investigators sent Heritage Thermal’s general manager what is known as a Section 114(a) request for detailed information on the explosion. Failing to answer the questions, warned George T. Czerniak, who was then the E.P.A.’s Chicago-based director of the air and radiation division, could result in punishment.

Heritage Thermal complied within weeks, and also disclosed that the plant had faced a series of related problems when pressure inside the incinerator had climbed to dangerous levels. Mr. Czerniak asked for more information about those episodes, and by March 2015 he had signed a formal letter of complaint, alleging a series of Clean Air Act violations that would very likely result in fines, as well as possible civil or criminal action.

“We are offering you an opportunity to confer with us about the violations,” Mr. Czerniak wrote in the letter. “You may have an attorney represent you at this conference.”

More than two and a half years later, the matter remains unresolved, leading to the letter of complaint to the E.P.A. last month from the East Liverpool City Council. The body is dominated by Democrats, but it says its motivation in criticizing the E.P.A. is based on concerns about public safety and not partisan politics.

John Mercer, a City Council member, said taking on air pollution issues at Heritage Thermal has been a delicate matter because the area has lost thousands of jobs as steel and pottery manufacturing plants closed. “Heritage Thermal is one of the city’s largest employers,” he said. “We are all friends and neighbors with those that work there.”

Still, he said, residents want the matter resolved. “Our constituents deserve answers that no one seems to want to provide,” he said.

A spokesman for the E.P.A. declined to comment on the case’s status, as did Christopher T. Pherson, president of Heritage Thermal. The company said in a statement that it “is committed to continuously enhancing its performance and environmental compliance.”

Ms. Estell, who was critical of the plant even before it opened in the 1990s for being built near homes, blames the change in administrations in Washington for the inaction. “Something made them slam on the brakes,” she said.

Every administration runs into delays when investigating and enforcing environmental laws, and it is hard to pinpoint why any particular case might stall without access to confidential E.P.A. files. But the lack of action in East Liverpool mirrors a pattern of sluggish new enforcement activity under the Trump administration, as represented in data analyzed by The Times.

The Times identified more than a dozen companies or plants like Heritage Thermal that received notices of violation toward the end of the Obama administration, but as of late November had not faced E.P.A. penalties. The findings were based on agency files released through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit group run by a former E.P.A. enforcement chief.

Indiana Harbor Coke in East Chicago, Ind., has received at least three warning notices since 2015 for pollution violations, including hundreds of illegal emissions of lead, which can cause serious health problems, especially for children.

Other cases include TimkenSteel Corporation of Canton, Ohio, which was served with a notice in November 2015 for illegally emitting hazardous toxins, including mercury, which, when inhaled in large quantities, can cause pulmonary edema, respiratory failure and death.

In Waterford, Ohio, Globe Metallurgical was cited in June 2015 and December 2016 for air pollution violations. The E.P.A. collected evidence that it was emitting illegal amounts of sulfur dioxide, which can irritate the nose and throat and, at very high concentrations, cause life-threatening accumulation of fluid in the lungs.

And in East Liverpool, just down the street from the Heritage Thermal incinerator, S.H. Bell was cited for allowing toxic levels of dust with heavy metal chemical additives such as manganese to drift beyond its property line.

Tests conducted near S.H. Bell found “the highest levels of ambient manganese concentrations in the United States,” a complaint issued during the Obama administration said. Health officials warned that the situation represented “a public health hazard and should be mitigated as soon as possible to reduce harmful exposures.”

Research led by the University of Cincinnati found in September that levels of manganese in the blood and hair of children in East Liverpool appeared to be related to lower I.Q. scores, a conclusion executives from S.H. Bell have disputed.","ohio department of health

"John Ismay, Thomas Gibbons-Neff and C. J. Chivers","When the Islamic State seized territory in Iraq and Syria, it had the time and space to industrialize advanced weapons manufacturing. The results included explosive space heaters and chemical rockets.",2017-12-10T23:35:49Z,the-new-york-times,How ISIS Produced Its Cruel Arsenal on an Industrial Scale,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/middleeast/isis-bombs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/05/autossell/00ISISBOMBS1/00ISISBOMBS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Taken together, the scope and scale of Islamic State production demonstrated the perils of a determined militant organization allowed to pursue its ambitions in a large, ungoverned space.

Some weapon components, for example, were essentially standardized, including locally manufactured injection-molded munition fuzes, shoulder-fired rockets, mortar ammunition, modular bomb parts and plastic-bodied land mines that underwent generations of upgrades. Many were produced in industrial quantities.

The findings also included apparent prototypes of weapons that either were not selected for mass production or were abandoned in development, including projectiles loaded with caustic soda and shoulder-fired rockets containing blister agent.

While the Islamic State has been routed from almost all its territory in Iraq and Syria, security officials say that its advances pose risks elsewhere, as its members move on to other countries, its foreign members return home and veterans of its arms-production network pool and share knowledge and techniques online.

“They’re spreading this knowledge all over the world,” said Ernest Barajas Jr., a former Marine explosive ordnance disposal technician who has worked with ordnance-clearing organizations in areas occupied by the Islamic State. “It’s going to the Philippines, it’s in Africa.” He added, “This stuff’s going to continue to grow.”

Born of Insurgency

One reason for the Islamic State’s level of sophistication was clear: Its armaments programs grew out of the insurgencies fighting the American occupation of Iraq from 2003 through 2011.

Sunni and Shiite militant groups became adept at making improvised bombs, both from conventional munitions abandoned in 2003 by Iraq’s defeated military, and with ingredients that bomb-makers prepared themselves. American officials say certain Shiite groups received technical assistance and components from Iran.

Sunni bomb makers also fielded chemical weapons, sometimes by combining explosive devices with chlorine, a toxic substance with legal applications, and other times in bombs made from degraded chemical rockets or shells left from Iraq’s defunct chemical warfare program.

The Islamic State, which evolved from Al Qaeda in Iraq, built upon its predecessors’ lethal industry.

The group’s larger success since also played a role. When the Islamic State seized swaths of territory and major cities in 2014, it took control of shops and factories with hydraulic presses, forges, computer-driven machine tools and plastic injection-molding machines. It also moved into at least one technical college and university lab. This infrastructure positioned the Islamic State for an arms-production breakout.

Behind the capacity was an armaments bureaucracy that supervised product development and manufacture, said Damien Spleeters, head of operations in Iraq and Syria for Conflict Armament Research, a private arms-monitoring and investigative firm that has done field work in both countries during the war.

The system was resilient, Mr. Spleeters said. One of the Islamic State’s projects, a series of recoilless launchers that gained prominence late in the battle for Mosul, in northern Iraq, was built from the ground up even while militants were pressured in combat from multiple foes on multiple fronts.

“It just kept going,” Mr. Spleeters said of the technical advancements. “They could develop stuff even as they lost territories.”

The Islamic State’s arms bureaucracy was also disciplined. Detonating cord used in improvised explosive devices was measured and allotted down to the centimeter, Mr. Spleeters said. When a stock ran out, management would fill out a request form for more. The material would be resupplied.

Mr. McInally said the group’s armament production appeared centralized and carefully considered.

As de-miners have found weapons, he said, they have routinely encountered improvised devices with a modular design that allowed for the Islamic State’s fighters to choose from uniform parts and assemble devices quickly. The separate parts were issued distinctly, to be combined before use.

Photo

“It’s a collection of pressure plates, a collection of charges, a collection of switches,” Mr. McInally said. “Components that can be connected as necessary. It’s clever. It’s impressive.”

The New York Times is withholding technical details of weapons and explosive mixtures described in this article to prevent the spread of information useful to copycats.

Mr. Barajas said the explosive charges themselves were further standardized — via a so-called homemade explosive with a recipe the group tweaked and produced at an industrial scale.

The mixture, he said, is a widely known combination of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and aluminum with a long history of use in many conflicts, including in Iraq. But the Islamic State improved the explosive with the addition of another material that makes it easier to detonate. The Times previously documented the Islamic State’s importation of large amounts of ammonium nitrate from Turkey, along with sections of heavy pipe.

Mr. McInally said the group also standardized other items: supplemental charges for mortar rounds to extend their range; a common fuze with a spring-loaded striker assembly machined from an over-the-counter bolt; and an improvised bomb — he said de-miners refer to it as a land mine — that was fielded in a standard-sized plastic tub.","ordnanceclearing

By June that year, the terrorist group had seized control of Iraq’s Sunni-dominated north and west, putting more than four million Iraqis under its control. At first, some of those Iraqis were willing supporters of the insurgent force, in large part because of the years of sectarian violence and abuse they had experienced from Iraq’s Shiite-majority politicians.

But the puritanical punishments and cruelties ISIS inflicted soon made the group a feared and unwelcome overlord.

Now, Iraqis around the capital and many parts of the liberated regions say they have a newfound pride in their security forces, as well as in their government. Mr. Abadi is routinely cited by supporters and rivals alike as Iraq’s most popular and trusted politician.

Still, security analysts and military commanders warned that the end of large-scale military maneuvers did not mean the end of the Islamic State threat.

Hours before Mr. Abadi’s speech, a bomb suspected of being planted by insurgents exploded in the center of Tikrit, the hometown of former President Saddam Hussein and an area of antigovernment activity for many years, before the creation of the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate.

Among the urgent challenges officials now face to ensure security and stability are reconstruction plans for cities like Mosul, which was destroyed by the fighting, as well as reconciliation programs for the country’s Sunni and Shiite communities, said Hussein Allawi, a professor of national security at Al Nahrain University in Baghdad.

Some three million Iraqis remain displaced by the war, and municipal services have yet to be restored in many liberated areas.

“The battles against Daesh are over, but the war is not,” Mr. Allawi said.

Hakim al-Zamili, who leads Parliament’s security and defense committee, estimates that 20,000 hard-core supporters of the Islamic State remain in the country, hidden among the large groups of displaced people or in remote areas of the western deserts.

Iraqi intelligence and other officials over recent weeks have documented the rise of a possibly new violent Islamist movement in the country, which has suffered attacks from various factions of jihadist movements over the past 15 years.

Mr. Zamili and other military officials cautioned that Iraq must devote significant intelligence resources to find and track down these extremists, and that continued military assistance from the American-led coalition was vital to this continuing mission. More than 5,000 American troops are currently based in Iraq, in addition to military trainers from Britain, Italy, Australia and other countries.

“Iraq still needs the intelligence cooperation with the international coalition and neighboring countries because there are many places for ISIS to hide,” said Wathiq al-Hashimi, the chairman of the Iraqi Group for Strategic Studies, an independent think tank in Baghdad. “ISIS commanders are now in different countries in the world.”","britain italy australia

Margaret Coker,"The battle to drive the Islamic State out of Mosul left much of the city in ruins. Now, residents are pulling together to rebuild.",2017-12-11T00:17:49Z,the-new-york-times,"After Fall of ISIS, Iraq’s Second-Largest City Picks Up the Pieces",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/10/world/middleeast/iraq-isis-mosul.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/11/world/middleeast/Mosul-Jrnl-slide-GR47/Mosul-Jrnl-slide-GR47-facebookJumbo.jpg,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Around 600,000 people remain displaced, and approximately 60,000 homes are uninhabitable. The city’s business and government sectors are crippled, with at least 20,000 commercial and government buildings destroyed, according to aerial images commissioned by the United Nations.

The west side in particular sustained apocalyptic damage. It took six months of grinding street-by-street battles and aerial bombardment to free the area, including the labyrinthine Old City, where the militants made their last stand.

“Mosul is a tale of two cities,” said Lise Grande, the humanitarian coordinator in Iraq and head of the United Nations Development Program. “In east Mosul, more than 95 percent of people are home. On the west side, it’s a completely different picture. Yet people are rolling up their sleeves and determined to get their lives back.”

Since the summer, the international community has spent about $400 million to help restore electricity, water and medical services, and donor countries, along with the Iraqi government, are struggling to create and finance a comprehensive multibillion-dollar redevelopment plan.

In the interim, Muslawis — as Mosul residents are called — have mustered their own resources and philanthropic spirit to breathe new life into the city.

The highways leading to Mosul are clogged with flatbed trucks bringing in commercial goods and construction materials. On both sides of the river, gleaming rows of washing machines, space heaters and children’s bikes are for sale. Restaurants, especially those with family sections, are doing a roaring business.

On Nov. 30, a Mosul nonprofit organized a marathon and shorter foot races for children, an event that drew around 4,000 people.

“We are excited to change the atmosphere of Mosul,” said Feras Khalil, an engineer supervising the reconstruction of Fountain Square, a park along a main commercial street on Mosul’s east side. “We want to give the opportunity for our neighbors to breathe fresh air after defeating Daesh,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.

On the east side, the sprawling Mosul University campus hums with activity from the 30,000 students — men and women — who are attending classes this fall. Hundreds of students from other parts of Iraq have also re-enrolled, a testament, they say, to their parents’ confidence about security.","multibilliondollar

Aside from the fact that it isolates work and life as two opposing states of being, it’s the number one topic that’s always brought up at a table of entrepreneurs.

I do think it’s important to discuss these topics and since entrepreneurship can be a lonely profession at times, you have to vent to someone, but what bugs me is people rarely admit the reality: work-life balance, at least for entrepreneurs, is a pretense. It’s a bit like when a doctor asks you whether you’ve ever smoked and your immediate answer is no even though you did and still do occasionally with a pint of beer.

No entrepreneurs I know finish working when they leave the office. Sure, they might not be answering emails or sitting at their laptop, but I’ll bet you that they’re thinking about their business, they’re reading, they’re innovating and that’s not a bad thing. Being obsessed with your business usually means you’re onto something good.

I’m not suggesting that we should all be plugged into work at all times, allowing your mind space is fundamental to your health and happiness, but we shouldn’t be beating ourselves up every time our thoughts wander into the realm of work when we’re supposed to be having “downtime”. Work-life balance, I believe, should be defined and implemented by the individual, and it becomes a struggle only when we try and fail to live up to others’ expectations.

So what’s my reality of work-life balance?

I started my first business at the age of 21 whilst living on an island off the coast of Honduras. It was exciting and I was passionate and reckless. Five years down the line, I was stuck behind a desk in British suburbia, managing spreadsheets.

The business was doing well, but not making enough money just yet. I was overweight, bored and stressed. A check-up at the doctor revealed the reality of the situation, which was that I’d gone ‘over the edge,’ or in his words: “If you carry on like this, you’ll be dead by the time you’re 50.”

Looking for a drastic quick fix, my wife, baby daughter, and I sold our home and moved to the beach in Costa Rica. I switched to working remotely, I got into raw food, surfing, and meditation. Despite the occasional hurricane and power cut, we were happy, but the business suffered without me.

I was lucky enough that the industry continued to boom even when the recession hit, but it didn’t grow like it could have done if I was there and as the years passed, I started to miss that buzz of brainstorming ideas, of motivating, of speaking to inspiring, like-minded people. Like many entrepreneurs, I’m restless by nature. So we moved again to Cape Town, where we still live now, and I started a new venture. This has tipped the balance again, but the difference is that although the hours are long, I’m truly excited about going into the office because the business is growing fast and I believe in it.

My point is that work-life balance, for entrepreneurs, is a myth by definition because our work is our life and if you want to succeed, there’s no way around that. If you’re talking in terms of hours spent in the office versus hours spent at home, that always fluctuates. What we really should be concerning ourselves with is creating an environment in which we and our employees can flourish, learn, have fun, be productive and relax.

It’s important for health and happiness and for business success. In a very insightful and humorous TED talk, Shawn Anchor, author of ‘The Happiness Advantage’ suggests that business owners need to:

Reverse the happiness and success formula. We think if we work harder and achieve some entrepreneurial goal, then we’ll be happier. But the research is clear that every time you have a success, your brain changes what success means. So for you and for your team, if happiness is on the opposite side of success, you’ll never get there. But if you increase your levels of happiness in the midst of a challenge, in the midst of searching for investment, in the midst of a down economy — what we find is that all of your success rates rise dramatically — every business outcome improves.

How can we increase happiness?

We recently had to let some of our employees go and I noticed a general dip in morale. This was damaging the productivity and the positivity of the team so we introduced free gym memberships and split up the office with moveable walls of plants to encourage creativity. We’re also about to install a sleep pod so that people can take naps and meditate during the day.

Most importantly, we’re trying to make the working day less automatic so that our employees still feel like they have some control over their lives. Our employees can start and leave whenever they like as long as the whole team is together between 11 am and 4 pm and they clock their hours.

In a recent article in the Guardian, titled “Why now’s the time to embrace flexible working”, Tom Neil, a guidance writer for ACAS predicts that for an organization to attract and retain a happy and productive workforce, employers need to think beyond traditional boundaries. “That means running a business in an open-minded and adaptable manner,” he says. “Most roles can accommodate some sort of flexible working arrangement… a compromise between the employee and the employer can often lead to an outcome that works for everyone.”

Make business more “life-like”

Understandably, it’s important to have boundaries between the office and home, and those should be respected by employers, but if we accept that work is a major part of our lives, then we should find ways to make it more “life-like”. Business success and profits aside, we need to be prioritizing our employees’ happiness so that they feel fulfilled and inspired.

It’s up to business leaders to make the change and that begins by letting go of the aspiration for a work-life balance that’s unattainable by definition. We all need to find and embrace our own rhythm.","entrepreneurship

Engineers, scientists, and manufacturers once made bold steps and drove the human race forward. Less than 10 years passed from developing jet engines to launching a supersonic aircraft into the sky and 20 years from the first fully automatic computer to one that took us to the moon.

Now? Most engineering teams make progress by the inch, despite their relatively vast resources. Today, design by committee is killing progress.

I believe in design by small teams, who can support each other when times get tough, who can think on their feet and make decisions quickly. The future lies with small groups of engineers, empowered to do great things.

As founders and engineers, it’s our bid to turn back the tide and reinvigorate innovation.

Expansive teams ruin innovation

Big companies have enormous teams now, and their agility has suffered because of it. In the old days, small teams could simply decide to work together on a new project. Now, companies like Volkswagen have dozens of engineers designing new gears by committee, and it can take weeks and even months to reach a simple decision.

It’s become part of the culture, but it’s stifling creativity thanks to an in-built risk aversion.

Technology is meant to be agile, efficient, and tight. But when it comes to project management, firms often revert to the “tried and trusted” departments that don’t allow individual engineers to really grab the project by the scruff of the neck.

Departments focus on their particular slice of the task before stitching them together at the end. Along the way, they make a series of compromises to get their job done, which can have a horrendous knock-on effect when combined with the other departments’ own hacks. In the end, everything runs over time and over cost. To me, that doesn’t come as a surprise. It’s just a result of the way teams work today.

Lessons in bloat with Microsoft Bob

Microsoft Bob was a classic example of a big project that had all the ingredients, but the final dish was a disaster. This user-friendly interface was meant to replace Windows Program Manager — only the end result wasn’t user-friendly at all and most potential customers couldn’t even use it.

By the time it was unveiled in 1995, the software demanded more performance than pretty much any computer on the open market could provide. Microsoft Bob was withdrawn from the market in less than a year and remains a salutary lesson.

The final objective of Bob was to be a user-friendly interface that runs on any computer. It was a classic case of losing sight of this very objective.

Fred Brooks can also tell us all about the failure of big software projects. He did just that in his seminal 1975 book “The Mythical Man Month.”

Brooks took charge of IBM’s 360 Project, the largest non-military mainframe project of the day. It was a lesson in bloat. As the project fell further behind, IBM threw more resources and people at the project, only to watch it get worse.

Brooks came to the startling conclusion that every time the company added a programmer, the project fell further behind. This single thought formed the basis of his book, which revealed that as you add engineers, you also need to add unproductive and yet essential coordinators.

That comes with in-built communication problems and inefficiency. So adding more manpower to a software project will just make your problems worse.

A stain on the Blue Oval’s history

Elsewhere, the Ford Edsel project has become a case study in how not to build and market a product.

This goes to show that abundant resources and large teams can be a huge factor in failure.

This premier car for middle-class Americans was a disaster from the start. It was designed by a chaotic committee and the company revealed 18 different versions at the launch.

Worse was to come. It was meant to be a luxury product, and the first cars were delivered with oil leaks and push buttons that couldn’t be pressed without the help of a hammer. This is a clear example of different departments trying to force their own solutions through and creating square pegs for round holes.

Ford took the sub-brand off the market entirely in 1960 and the car that was named after Henry Ford’s son is a stain on the Blue Oval’s history.

The lesson is clear. You need individuals’ driving forces to take total ownership and focus on the design of the product.

That’s why small companies, with the founder at the helm, can often overcome impossible odds to make a better product. The results speak for themselves.

There’s still much to learn from Jobs and Wozniak

Simply put, look at Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who built the Apple I together in a garage in 1976. Jobs agonized over everything in his early computers, from the looks of motherboard design to sifting thousands of shades of beige for the casing of the Apple II.

In the very beginning, the pair had no engineers to oversee and they only had to coordinate themselves. That is how two men managed to design the Apple I and II, which would spawn one of the greatest tech companies of our time.

WhatsApp is another example of what you can achieve with less. Founder Jan Koum actually used a budget coder from RentaCoder.com and did most of the other work himself. When they got seed money, they rented cubicles in the HQ of Evernote. They opted to stay small and turned down the VCs banging on their door. They wanted to stay focused on the product and knew that a large team would have distracted them.

Together they could react to the constantly shifting app network to help WhatsApp evolve into a messaging app that Facebook later paid $19 billion to acquire. When the deal went through in February 2014, Whatsapp had just 100 employees.

Changing directions for a big team is like turning a ship around. It takes time. But a small team can react instantly and that’s a vital trait in a constantly shifting market.

Two pizza rule with Jeff Bezos

That’s why Amazon’s Jeff Bezos has the “two pizza rule.” He says he doesn’t have meetings with groups that couldn’t be fed with two pizzas. Amazon is the world’s biggest retailer and this clearly isn’t a financial decision. Bezos simply knows that communication in small groups is more efficient.

Realizing the benefits of small teams, other big companies are now splitting their own staff into startup-sized units. GlaxoSmithKline has de-scaled research teams into small groups of eight to 60 people and it believes this will drive innovation.

This isn’t a new concept. In the 1970s a small team of Volkswagen engineers took the company’s Golf and worked in their spare time, with passion and drive, to create the Golf GTi that went on to become one of the greatest performance cars of all time. It was developed in a private garage, by a group of eight people.

They followed in the footsteps of Lockheed, which has had a Skunk Works team since the 1940s and coined the term “Skunk Works” when first placing a handful of their best engineers in a circus tent outside their factory to work on a special project. Its greatest hits include the U-2 Bomber, SR-71 Blackbird and P-80 Shooting Star.

The latter was the first US jet fighter plane, developed by a team of 28 engineers, completed before schedule and under budget. Free from the shackles of management, Lockheed’s engineers created icons that remain unparalleled compared with today’s aviation industry.

So, it might be tempting to simply throw money and resources at problems, but it isn’t necessarily the answer. Many of our greatest innovations have come from small teams that have been given a free reign to create masterpieces. It’s a model that is open to us all, and it’s a model that more companies should think about using.

You’d have to go back to iOS 10.2.1 to find a working version that’s widely-known. Since the last working exploit, the jailbreaking community has mostly gone dark, with repositories remaining un-updated (or closed) and a group of once cooperative hackers now at large with both each other and those hungry for future exploits.

Our own Abhimanyu Ghoshal even penned a piece to signify the cat and mouse game between exploit-hunting hackers and Apple developers was, well, pretty much over.

That’s until a recent tweet by Google researcher Ian Beer, anyway.

If you're interested in bootstrapping iOS 11 kernel security research keep a research-only device on iOS 11.1.2 or below. Part I (tfp0) release soon. — Ian Beer (@i41nbeer) December 5, 2017

Beer’s tweet doesn’t exactly give away the ending, but popular opinion seems to suggest he’s working on, or perhaps close to revealing, a jailbreak for iOS version 11.1.2 or below.

A Motherboard piece seems to follow this logic, with a caveat — which we’ll get to in a moment.

Ian Beer is a Google Project Zero security researcher, and one of the most prolific iOS bug hunters. Wednesday, he told his followers to keep their “research-only” devices on iOS 11.1.2 because he was about to release “tfp0” soon. (tfp0 stands for “task for pid 0,” or the kernel task port, which gives you control of the core of the operating system.) He also hinted that this is just the first part of more releases to come. iOS 11.1.2 was just patched and updated last week by Apple; it is extremely rare for exploits for recent versions of iOS to be made public.

Reddit is also abuzz with the news.

The reason this is so big is that iOS 11 was only updated last week. Finding a recent public jailbreak is rare, as these are the sort of exploits that typically net a nice payday for bug bounty hunters (or blackhat hackers). But Beer, a Google employee working on iOS exploits as part of his day job would have little incentive (or is perhaps contractually obligated not to) to chase these types of rewards.

As for the likelihood OP will deliver, it’s hard to doubt Beer. He’s the same researcher who released exploits for iOS 10.1.1 and 10.3.2 in the past. And according to Motherboard, he’s found several 0days in iOS during his time at Google.

But before you get too excited, it’s important to note that whatever Beer releases probably won’t be a full-blown untethered jailbreak: meaning, you’ll have to plug in the device each time it boots. Sorry kids, the days of one-click exploits are long over.

What security researchers we spoke with all seem to agree on, however, is that it’ll provide the pieces needed for the jailbreak community to, perhaps, figure out the rest.

According to initial reports from TechCrunch, the deal could be announced ...",2017-12-09T00:15:12Z,the-next-web,Apple to buy music discovery platform Shazam,https://thenextweb.com/apple/2017/12/09/apple-buy-music-discovery-platform-shazam/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/12/apple-shazam-social.png,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Reports today indicate that Apple is in the final stages of a deal with music discovery platform Shazam.

According to initial reports from TechCrunch, the deal could be announced as soon as Monday. If the sale happens, the price being floated is around $400 million, a number Recode later confirmed. This would mark a significant discount for a company valued at around $1 billion in its last funding round. Shazam has, since its 2002 launch, raised at least $140 million.

The news follows earlier rumors of Snapchat as a potential suitor. Snap inked a deal late last year that allowed Snapchatters to Shazam a song from within the app. In the end, it would appear Apple won out. It’s unclear how the new deal would affect these older agreements.

As for the reason behind the acquisition, we’ve yet to hear any official statements — or confirmation from either party that it’s even happening: although we’re certain it is. Multiple requests have gone unanswered.

From Apple’s perspective, the benefits are numerous. The most obvious, albeit minor for a company Apple’s size, is that it can quit paying commissions to users sent to iTunes to purchase.

If we were to put our thinking caps on, however, a more tangible benefit would be in the form of added pressure to competitors like Spotify and Google Play Music. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Shazam sends approximately a million clicks a day to the service.

And as The Verge pointed out, the biggest benefits may be tied to the augmented reality tech baked into Shazam’s platform. Earlier this year the company launched an AR platform for brands that further built on technology it introduced back in 2015, tech that allowed users to scan physical products like magazines, books, and advertisements to launch additional information — sort of like Google Lens.

This could point to reactionary movement as a bid to catch up with features baked into the Pixel 2. Google already has Lens, an AR platform built to do exactly what Snapchat’s does. And then there’s the always-on listening (which you can disable) tech that identifies songs it hears in the background. Unlike Shazam, however, Pixel 2 owners don’t have to pick up the phone, unlock it, or open the app.

We’ll know more in the coming days.

Rachel Kaser,"Grief is one of the most difficult, trying psychological phenomena, and it's something that almost every one of us is guaranteed to feel at some point in our lives. It's never been ...",2017-12-09T00:09:17Z,the-next-web,An untimely frost: Digital tools for coping with grief and loss,https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/12/09/technology-coping-digital-tools-grieving/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/07/candles-social.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Grief is one of the most difficult, trying psychological phenomena, and it’s something that almost every one of us is guaranteed to feel at some point in our lives. It’s never been an easy thing, as the scores of literature from the dawn of time will attest, and there is no modern digital band-aid that will cure it.

That said, there are some online tools which can help grieving survivors come to terms with their loss and cope with them in the hyperconnected modern world.

Note that nothing is a substitute for good therapy and strong family support — these tools aren’t an adequate replacement for either. These are more like alternate solutions to the everyday pangs that grief brings.

Forums

If you’ve ever needed a village to help you through the tough times, you might find the support you need at forums.grieving.com, also called Beyond Indigo. Relatively active and with a modestly-sized community, Beyond Indigo’s members seem sensitive and sympathetic in the many thousands of posts on the boards.

There are multiple boards, for various different forms of grief, help-seeking, and aftereffects of loss. While you’re not likely to find threads with hundreds of responses, the ones there do seem to be positive and full of empathetic advice.

Stress

One of the oft-overlooked side effects of loss is stress. Apart from the strain of a part of your life suddenly not being present anymore, setting their affairs in order can be a hassle-and-a-half. Depending on their estate or funeral expenses, you can find yourself neck deep in stress at a time when you need it the least.

Credit: Headspace

Meditation apps can help you manage your stress levels during the worst times. One of the most ubiquitous and easy-to-use is the guided meditation app Headspace, which can show you the basics of meditation and how to remove yourself from painful situations.

Therapy

As stated above, nothing is a substitute for good therapy, but it can be difficult for some people to access the kind of services they need. There are a myriad of options for short-term counselling, but some people might require more long-term treatment, especially if the grief is unexpected or traumatic.

My colleague Tristan Greene reviewed the Ginger app, which gives a paying user 24/7 access to mental health resources, including coaches and therapists. The app isn’t free, unfortunately, but for those who might be able to spare the minimum $129 a month for the basic subscription, it can be extremely helpful to have someone to talk with at all times.

Journaling

Journaling is a well-known tool for dealing with grief, especially for children. It can be a great way to keep a lost loved one in your thoughts while remembering positive things about them. There’s really no wrong way to do it, and there are a number of options for journaling.

Basic journaling apps can do the job fairly well — I’ve used Dropbox and Evernote, and even the iPhone’s built-in note app when I needed to. There are a few apps which act specifically as grief journals, but the free apps such as those are less likely to restrict to a particular scenario (loss of a parent, grandparent, etc).

If you have any further digital coping mechanisms to help with grief, let everyone know about them in the comments. What worked for you might be a great help to someone else.

If you want to use music in a Facebook or Instagram video, the Sound Collection gives you options that won’t get you dinged for copyright infringement.

Facebook removes any video uploaded that contains copyrighted music — similarly to how YouTube works. So instead of adding an Ariana Grande song to that highlight reel of vacation photos and potentially getting a black mark for it, the company is giving you a selection of music it owns to use instead. Note that these will only be free and clear to use in Facebook and Instagram videos.

The sound collection contains a number of tracks, sorted by genre. A lot of it feels more kind of generic, like elevator music, but some of it is actually not that bad. With 1,000 tracks and 1,500 sound effects, it’s by no means an extensive list — I’m not going to get to score my winter staycation with “Stairway to Heaven,” sadly — but it’s still good to have options.

YouTube also offers a collection of royalty-free songs and sound effects, so it’s obvious who Facebook is taking notes from. This might be part of Facebook’s effort to draw in new creators, away from the more well-established video site. Since the launch of its Watch app earlier this year, Facebook needs new voices and faces if it wants the kind of diverse content with which it can compete with the likes of YouTube.

While a free music library might not be the biggest step towards courting the YouTube audience, it is the kind of tool Facebook has long needed if it doesn’t want content creators to feel hamstrung as soon as they boot up the site.

Facebook’s Sound Collection is rolling out to everyone over the next few days. You can find the library here.

Tristan Greene,"If you're planning on selling your old Windows 10 PC because you're getting a sweet new rig, you'll want to make sure you clean your old device – and we don't mean with a moist towelette. ...",2017-12-08T21:54:40Z,the-next-web,Here's how to clean your Windows 10 PC before you sell it,https://thenextweb.com/evergreen/2017/12/08/heres-how-to-clean-your-windows-10-pc-before-you-sell-it/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/12/laptop_water-social.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"If you’re planning on selling your old Windows 10 PC because you’re getting a sweet new rig, you’ll want to make sure you clean your old device – and we don’t mean with a moist towelette. There’s a few steps you’ll need to take to ensure you’re not giving some stranger on eBay your personal information when you hand over your old device.

First, think about your data

Chances are you’ve saved pictures, videos, and documents on your harddrive. When you wipe your computer you’ll lose all of it. Make sure you’re backing up anything you don’t want to lose. You can either use an external hard drive or cloud storage.

Make sure you check any folders you’ve created and migrate those files manually. Once this is done you can use the Windows backup feature for the rest.

go to Settings

click on All Settings

click on Updates and Security

click on Backup

Once you’ve finished backing up your files you can disconnect your external hardrive.

Check your software

If you’ve got third party software installed, especially the kind you run in compatibility mode, make sure you don’t need to unregister your computer in that program’s UI before you wipe the hard drive.

Some older games and applications could require repurchasing if you lose the computer they are installed on before you de-register that device.

Apps and software purchased/installed through the Windows Store shouldn’t pose any concern, but always check with the software manufacturer if you’re concerned – especially if you can’t test things out on the new PC before you get rid of the old one.

Perform the reset

If you’ve gotten everything you need from your old PC, it’s time to perform a full reset. The good news is: this is easy. But the bad news is that it’s not really a clean sweep.

Here’s the most important thing you need to know about this process: it’s a “consumer” level cleaning process. That means it’s good enough to make sure that you’re average person isn’t going to be able to access your deleted files.

But if an expert or hacker really wanted to recover all those deleted files they’d probably be able to. Which is why you should consult an expert and consider specialty software before you get rid of your old gear if this is a concern for you.

If you’re not worried that someone is going to spend a lot of time and energy trying to dig out your computer’s secrets, then proceed with these steps:

go to Settings

click on All Settings

click on Update and Security

click on Recovery

click on Get Started underneath Reset this PC

click on Delete Everything

follow the on-screen instructions

Once this is complete proceed to the final steps (on a different device):

go to account.microsoft.com/devices

select Remove

follow the instructions to remove your old device from your account

Once you’ve taken care of these steps you should have a reasonable assurance that your data has been deleted (again, with the above caveat that this isn’t a professional wipe). Your computer is ready for its new owner.

Most are heavy which makes them ...,2017-12-08T20:06:26Z,the-next-web,Review: I can barely hear anything when I wear these wireless earbuds and that's awesome,https://thenextweb.com/gear/2017/12/08/review-these-active-noise-canceling-wireless-earbuds-are-fantastic-for-studying-and-work/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/12/linnerfeat-social.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"If you want a decent pair of headphones that feature active noise canceling (ANC) and wireless Bluetooth connectivity the options are fairly limited. Most are heavy, which makes them ill-suited for extended wear. Others are simply too expensive, with typical price tags in the $300 range — especially if you aren’t even sure whether you even care about ANC or not.

Enter Linner’s NC50 wireless active noise canceling headphones. According to the company these are the lightest ANC headphones in the world. After spending a couple of weeks with them, I highly recommend them for anyone curious about ANC, or looking for an inexpensive backup.

Credit: Nicole Gray

While I can’t personally back up the claim that the NC50 is the world’s lightest ANC headphones, I will say they certainly feel lighter, when worn, than any others I’ve used. The semi-rigid plastic neck-piece drapes comfortably across the neck, and it’s easy to forget it’s there.

The controls, which feature an on/off switch, ANC toggle, and a volume rocker with call button, are easy to navigate, and I found the whole device both simple and comfortable.

Specifications for the Linner NC50 earbuds are as follows:

Talk time: Up to 13 hours

Charging port: Micro USB

Charging time: 2 Hours

Sweat proof: (IPV4)

Bluetooth version: V4.1

Operating distance: approx. 33ft/10m

Noise Reduction working Range: 45Hz – 3KHz

Weight: 1.31 oz/ 37 grams

The sound quality, when listening to music, didn’t blow me away. But more on that in a bit. The important question I wanted to answer was whether or not it the ANC was decent or just a tacked-on feature.

Active noise canceling is a function that enables headphones to play audio that effectively cancels out the sounds of external noise. Using microphones, the device will, for example, play a fuzzy humming sound to block out the noise from a loud appliance nearby. The result of these competing sounds is something close to silence.

The ANC feature of the NC50 earbuds is actually quite good. They’re not quite perfect and the effective range of its ANC didn’t feel as robust as over-the-ear noise-cancelers I’ve used, such as the Bose QC or Beats Studio offerings. However, the Linner earbuds don’t cost anything close to what those other brands do.

Credit: Nicole Gray

Aside from the ANC, the NC50’s sound didn’t impress much. Highs tended to fizzle a bit and I was never able to find a volume level that sounded right. The low-end bass sound from the drivers was the lone highlight. The earbuds brought a proper amount of thump to a “Southern Hip Hop BBQ” playlist I was listening to.

I wasn’t bothered by an average performance when it came to music, because these headphones quickly became my work earbuds. They’re light enough to wear all day, even for someone who spends the entirety of their time in front of a keyboard and screen.

The ANC is good enough to block out annoying sounds, but be forewarned: they do little for conversation. If you intend to use them to mute the sound of a TV while you’re working on the couch and the family is watching Bob’s Burgers, you’re not going to miss a word of dialogue.

However, for the office or the library they’re fantastic.

Perhaps the most impressive feature about the NC50 earbuds is the advertised 13 hours of playback is spot-on. I definitely got that much out of them, and the majority of my use was with ANC turned on.

Before you go buying a set of ANC headphones that cost more, and require a couple of AA batteries or a cord, consider giving these a shot.

I liked the Linner NC50 earbuds a lot. I’d definitely recommend them to anyone who works at home, in a cubicle, or just needs a little bit more peace and quiet throughout the day.

And since they only cost $46.99 on Amazon, you can get yourself a set without going into debt.

When Facebook announced Instant Games last year, it had 17 games in its repertoire, including Pac-Man, Galaga, and Space Invaders. Now it’s got over 70 games with several more to come next year, including the likes of Sonic, Angry Birds, and Disney Tsum Tsum.

The biggest update to Messenger is the addition of a livestreaming option. To stream yourself playing your Messenger game, you tap the camera icon in the corner of the screen. The broadcast will be saved to your Page or profile after it is complete. I don’t know how much of an audience there is for livestreams of Tetris, but I’ve been surprised before.

Another update is the ability to game while video chatting. The feature will initially be tested with the game Words with Friends. Naturally, you’ll still be able to use Facebook’s funny video filters, because what is social media for if not playing word games while you look like a cat?

The livestreaming started rolling out this week, while the video chat feature will be introduced early next year.

The holidays are here and we’re all preparing to gather ’round the old Amazon Echo to celebrate the miracle of AI with our loved ones. With its newest update, Alexa hosts Santa Clause who’ll help Echo owners find the perfect seasonal music.

Amazon’s virtual assistant now responds to “talk to Santa Claus” across all supported devices. When prompted it’ll summon Santa himself to spread holiday cheer by asking what kind of Christmas music you’re interested in listening to.

The jolly one even hosts one of the stations, North Pole Radio on iHeartRadio.

“Talk to Santa Claus” works without having to enable any skills in the app or on Amazon’s website. Alexa will respond to several other holiday commands, including:

What do you want for Christmas?

Is Santa Claus real? / Do you believe in Santa? / Is there a Santa?

Where does Santa Claus live? / What is Santa Claus’ full address?

How old is Santa Claus?

Sing me a Christmas Carol

What can you tell me about Santa’s reindeer?

What do you know about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer?

Who’s your favorite reindeer?

What is the true meaning of Christmas?

Merry Christmas

Kids should get a kick out of interacting with Alexa and Santa, and if parents get tired of hearing the same thing over and over there’s always the world of skills.

The “NORAD Tracks Santa” skill is a fun way to stoke excitement leading up to Christmas Eve. Another nifty skill worth enabling is “Santa Claus,” which will help you determine if you’ve been naughty or nice this year.

Also just released is a “Holiday Song Quiz” which is, as you might have guessed, a holiday version of the popular “Song Quiz” skill. With it, you and your friends and family can compete in a musical trivia competition.

If you’re feeling a bit “bah humbug” this year perhaps you just need more smart speakers. For optimum holiday cheer we recommend getting at least ten, placing them all in the same room, and playing a different Christmas song at maximum volume on each. Or you could opt to keep your sanity.

Loren Grush,The commercial space industry is outpacing government oversight,2017-12-09T18:00:02Z,the-verge,Is Elon Musk even allowed to send his car to deep space?,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/9/16742136/spacex-elon-musk-tesla-roadster-falcon-heavy-mars-international-space-law,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HVbIVCNIBcuOwIz3S4EEZq2WeI=/0x51:1000x575/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9839337/Roadster_Still.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"After much fanfare, Elon Musk made it clear that he does plan to launch his Tesla Roadster to Mars on the Falcon Heavy next year — but questions remained over whether the mission is allowed. Are there any major federal hurdles SpaceX has to overcome in order to launch the very first sports car into deep space?

Musk initially said he wanted to send the car to Mars orbit, which could raise concerns about planetary protection. That’s the concept of preventing contamination of worlds in our Solar System with Earth life. Honoring planetary protection is a matter of international law, as it’s mandated in the Outer Space Treaty — a 50-year-old document that dictates guidelines for what countries can and cannot do in space. And the US is ultimately responsible for US commercial space companies adhering to the treaty.

“It’s a dummy payload — an exquisite dummy payload.”

The Tesla Roadster isn’t really going to Mars, though, so SpaceX isn’t going to run afoul of international space law; instead, the car will be delivered near where Mars orbits around the Sun, about 141 million miles from Earth, and then left to travel forever through space, according to further clarification from Musk. As long as the Roadster doesn’t interfere with the Red Planet, SpaceX should be fine. “It’s a dummy payload — an exquisite dummy payload — but what it does fall down to is it’s not performing any operation in space,” Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, tells The Verge.

If SpaceX wanted the Roadster to perform a specific task — such as land on Mars or an asteroid — it would be a different story. Such a mission would fall into a weird regulatory gap that has been plaguing the US government for a while now. The US has successfully overseen the launch and licensing of commercial satellites in orbit around Earth for the last 50 years, but there’s currently no legal framework to oversee what are deemed “non-traditional” commercial space missions. These include things like sending a rover to the Moon, launching a human habitat into orbit... or sending a car to Mars.

“One of the big challenges is how does the government say yes to a lot of these new innovative private sector space activities,” Brian Weeden, a space expert and director of programming for the Secure World Foundation, tells The Verge.

The process for launching satellites has been more or less streamlined for a while. Companies that want to send up a payload have to apply for a license with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in order to use part of the radio spectrum to communicate with the satellite. And they also have to apply for a launch license with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which ensures that the mission will not cause damage to property on the ground or be a danger to the public.

“how does the government say yes to a lot of these new innovative private sector space activities.”

But when a mission involves more than launching satellites, that’s where companies enter something of a Wild West scenario. There is no framework for overseeing a company’s actions in space; once a vehicle deploys from a rocket into orbit, that’s where federal jurisdiction ends. “The FAA’s authority is over the launch vehicle; once the payload separates, they have no authority there,” says Weeden.

That’s starting to become a problem as space companies propose more ambitious missions. The US government needs a way to ensure that companies won’t get the nation in trouble by violating the Outer Space Treaty while in space. And planetary protection is definitely a concern, as more companies talk about sending spacecraft to the Moon or Mars. The treaty states that countries should explore other worlds and “conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination.”

Currently, NASA adheres to strict planetary protection guidelines set forth by an international agency called COSPAR, which details how spacecraft should be handled depending on where they’re going. Earth is teeming with microbes that can easily hitchhike on spacecraft, and if we contaminate another planet with our own bacteria, it’ll be hard to study that alien world in its pristine state. So for any spacecraft heading to a place that might host life, such as Mars, there are important rules to follow.

COSPAR rules say that rockets that send spacecraft to Mars have to have a less than one in 10,000 chance of hitting the planet. And Mars orbiters don’t have to adhere to strict cleaning requirements, as long as there is a 99 percent chance of missing Mars in 20 years, and a 95 percent chance of missing the planet in 50 years. “There are no particular requirements that would have to be met if that orbit is not going to impact Mars for a long period of time,” John Rummel, NASA’s former planetary protection officer, tells The Verge.

the upcoming Falcon Heavy test flight does illustrate the need for a regulatory framework

If SpaceX wanted to do more with the Roadster, however, then it might run into some friction. Such a scenario happened last year when private spaceflight company Moon Express sought approval to send its future lunar lander to the Moon. The company feared the State Department might step in to block the launch; there was no way for the government to ensure that Moon Express would follow the law while on the Moon. So as a short-term solution, Moon Express voluntarily offered the State Department all the details of how the company would comply with the Outer Space Treaty. It’s possible SpaceX may do something similar.

“I’m sure knowing the way SpaceX operates, they’re giving them everything but the kitchen sink and being incredibly diligent on this process,” says Stallmer.

Oddly enough, the upcoming Falcon Heavy test flight does illustrate the need for a regulatory framework — and soon. SpaceX has not been silent about its deep space ambitions, and once the Falcon Heavy is online, the company has even bigger plans for the rocket beyond launching cars. For instance, SpaceX plans to send two tourists around the Moon as early as next year (though there hasn’t been much of an update on that). And SpaceX has even bigger plans to build the new BFR, or Big Falcon Rocket, which could someday take people to the surface of the Moon and Mars.

Fortunately, Congress is working on a solution. In June, the House passed the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act of 2017, which would give the Department of Commerce oversight of commercial activities in space. It’s still unclear exactly if and when this bill will become law, but it’s clear that something is needed. The lack of oversight in this area is becoming harder to ignore. As Weeden says: “This is just another example of how the commercial space world is outpacing the existing oversight process.”","american space commerce free enterprise

Shannon Liao,Light undertones of Bojack Horseman,2017-12-10T14:00:02Z,the-verge,Just Doug is one of the few good Facebook Watch series in a sea of clickbait,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/10/16665426/facebook-watch-just-doug-kim-clickbait-asian-american-acting,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TbwxqrFZIV9gn7-aOx3mwNs39A=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9738469/JD_169.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"In the short time since the new video streaming platform Facebook Watch went live in September, clickbait videos have risen to the front page of the platform, obscuring smaller producers from the spotlight. It’s bad news for guys like Doug Kim, who bet $165,000 of his own money on producing his Facebook Watch series, Just Doug.

Kim describes Just Doug as a mix between Togetherness, the HBO drama about two couples pursuing their dreams, and Bojack Horseman, Netflix’s madcap show about an anthropomorphic horse who is also a failed actor. He co-wrote, executive produced and starred in the series, where he plays a version of himself in a semi-autobiographical tale about how Kim, a former professional poker player turned struggling actor, took $2.4 million home in 2006 from the World Series of Poker. In a sea of clickbait, Just Doug stands out as a bitingly sarcastic take on one Asian-American man’s struggle to break into Hollywood—the same thing the real Kim hopes to accomplish with the show itself.

Kim has made three episodes of the show so far—a total of 26 minutes of footage— although he has prepared a show bible for an entire season. His hope is that despite the odds, TV networks will see something in his nearly finished product that they like, especially as Facebook Watch hasn’t given him as many views as he would like.

The show pays particular attention to the specific struggles faced by Asian actors in Hollywood. In one episode, Kim is asked to play a stereotypical Asian character on a sitcom. It’s a situation that many Asian-American actors find themselves in when they’re starting out in Hollywood. Partway through filming, Kim gets fed up with the racism in the scene and throws a tantrum, storming across the set and shouting in an exaggerated Asian accent.

The showrunners decide to run with his tantrum take when the show airs, and the result is a scene where Kim seems to be participating in a racist caricature rather than criticizing it; on Twitter, he is attacked as a sellout. It’s moments like those that make Just Doug stand out, especially in a sea of Facebook Watch videos about “How to Date an Asian Girl” or “How to Get Out of the Friend Zone.”

Just Doug Teaser Poker. Hollywood. Asian penis debates. What more can you ask for? Posted by Just Doug on Tuesday, October 31, 2017

The premise of Just Doug sounds similar to Aziz Ansari’s Emmy-winning series Master of None, where Ansari plays a loosely autobiographical South Asian-American man pursuing an acting career.

“When I saw the Vulture article [about his show] I was like, fuck. We were so deep into it already and then his show came out in November,” Kim told The Verge. “Although I noted similarities, I’m not too worried. Master of None is like standup, every episode is a different topic. My show is more like Girls, it’s more narrative-based.”

To further differentiate himself from Master of None, Kim plans to develop his character in distinctive ways, perhaps getting back into his roots in the Las Vegas poker world.

“Eventually, I see the show being about compromise,” says Kim, “How willing are you to sacrifice your values to get to your goals? Is it worth it to stay in [Hollywood]?”

Kim knows that his show has been buried under clickbait since its release in early November. He’s been in talks for months with Facebook about getting the series in the featured section, and so for December 10th, Just Doug will be featured in Today’s Spotlight. The three episodes already filmed look nearly ready for traditional broadcast, and he's hoping a network will pick up the series.

When I asked him why he didn’t just make a web series with lower production values, perhaps on YouTube, so that he could afford to produce a whole season, he said he wanted to prove he could deliver higher quality work from the get-go, even if it’s not the way it’s usually done in Hollywood. “I’m a gambler,” he says, “You could say that this time, I’m betting on myself.”","semiautobiographical

Angela Chen,More senses are better than one,2017-12-10T15:00:02Z,the-verge,Why reading aloud makes you remember better,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/10/16751226/reading-memory-neuroscience-studying,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jMXgyS27CQC9HQ1O1IPTgNHgflo=/0x0:600x314/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3577162/archer-promo.0.png,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"The majority of people stop reading aloud once they’re past the stage of sounding out the letters, but a small study suggests that doing so will help us remember, and tells us more about why.

For the study published in Memory, scientists recorded 75 students saying 160 words aloud. Two weeks later, they studied 80 of these words in a variety of ways: hearing their own recording of the words, hearing a recording of someone else say them, reading them silently, reading aloud to themselves. To make sure the order wasn’t important, various students used the techniques in different orders.

Next, they were shown a word and had to say whether they had just studied it. The most effective study method was reading the words aloud (77 percent correct answers), followed by listening to a recording, hearing someone else say the words, and reading in silence.

Because the scientists separated out different parts of the process, the results suggest that the advantage comes not just from reading or listening, but specifically from reading and hearing ourselves. The authors suggest that reading things aloud involves different types of processing, which makes it more active and engages us more than reading silently.

The study is small, and has the usual problem of including WEIRD undergraduates. Still, it confirms what we already know: when it comes to learning and remembering, more senses are better.","reading

Andrew Liptak,A staple of sci-fi warfare,2017-12-10T16:19:01Z,the-verge,18 suits of power armor from science fiction you don’t want to meet on the battlefield,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/10/16173596/science-fiction-power-armor-exoskeletons-iron-man-expanse-starship-troopers-halo-list,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pk2DljpBJ21Sg2CjPGBz8ddBS6E=/0x78:1080x643/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9840003/206_expanse_photo08.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Power armor and exoskeletons are a staple in science fiction. They enhance the abilities of futuristic soldiers on the battlefield, giving them an edge against their enemies. Recently, my colleague Lauren Goode finished out the second season of her series Next Level by checking out the promising future of exoskeletons in the workplace. She mentioned that while these devices have their roots in military technology, designers are hoping that they can be used to help help workers on the job or prevent them from getting injured, or assist the disabled move around.

Given those military roots, however, it shouldn’t come as any surprise that science fiction authors, game developers, or movie directors will use some sort of exoskeleton or suit of powered armor for a pivotal battle sequence — starting with Robert Heinlein’s classic novel Starship Troopers all the way up to games like Halo or films like Iron Man.

But not every set of power armor is equal, and there are some that might be better to come up against than others. Here’s 18 examples, ranked from what you wouldn’t want to run into in a fight to what you really don’t want to run into on the battlefield.

Caterpillar P-5000 Work Loader, Aliens

The Caterpillar P-5000 Work Loader from James Cameron’s Aliens is an iconic piece of sci-fi hardware, and we’ll probably see something similar in the real world before too much longer. It’s designed to allow workers to quickly and easily move heavy pieces of equipment and cargo around.

But while Ripley demonstrated that it can be a formidable weapon in the right hands, it’s not really designed for fighting. It’s a glorified fork lift, and it’s pretty slow and cumbersome. But it’ll do in a pinch.

Exo-Suit, Elysium

In his 2013 film Elysium, Neill Blomkamp populates his world with plenty of combat robots, but humans have their own augments as well. When Matt Damon’s character Max tells a crime boss that he’s willing to storm the film’s titular space station, he’s outfitted with an exoskeleton that’s grafted to his arms and legs, while the film’s villain, Kruger has a more advanced version of his own.

The Exo Suit from the film has its roots in real-world technology, and while these might have been designed for work, the film’s characters use them to give them an edge in a fight. There are some drawbacks, though. These suits don’t provide much armor, giving an opponent plenty of weak points to strike, and they’re drilled right onto a subject’s bones, meaning that you can’t easily take them off.

Exo Suits, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare

Set in a near future where private military corporations wage war on behalf of the governments of the world, 2014’s Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare prominently features exoskeletons that enhance a player’s movements in the game.

The game’s characters are equipped with Exo Suits, a frame that allows them to jump incredible heights, punch through doors, and more, which gives them incredible power and freedom of movement on the battlefield. The suits help speed up the game, and allow for plenty of add-ons to go into battle with.

Combat Jackets, Edge of Tomorrow

Doug Liman’s 2014 film Edge of Tomorrow features humanity fighting off an alien invasion, using heavy-duty exoskeletons called Combat Jackets to help soldiers on the ground run faster and carry heavy weapons into battle.

These combat jackets provide both extra strength, some armor, and heavy weapons for the soldiers that wear them. But they’re just a bit shy of being proper power armor, and it feels like they could stand to get some better head protection.

LCS Exoskeleton, Linda Nagata’s The Red trilogy

In her military science fiction trilogy The Red (The Red: First Light, The Trials, and Going Dark), Linda Nagata introduces readers to a group of specialized soldiers under the command of Lieutenant James Shelley: a linked combat squad. These soldiers head into the field with an impressive kit: an exoskeleton that lets them carry heavy loads and weapons into combat. But it also connects to neural laces implanted in their heads and links them to one another, making the entire unit a formidable adversary. They also have the incredibly creepy side effect of being able to walk their dead wearers back to base on their own after a battle.

The suits aren’t fully armored, but they provide quite a bit of protection to their wearers, and can be used in a variety of environments, from the African plains to high above the Arctic Circle.

Amplified Mobility Platform, Avatar

While James Cameron introduced the power loader to audiences in Aliens, he featured their militaristic cousins in his 2009 film Avatar. The Amplified Mobility Platform (also known as an AMP suit) is used by the RDA Corporation on Pandora for everything from moving around cargo to combat.

These massive suits are equipped with massive autocannon and a large knife, which gives its driver plenty of firepower. But while they’re agile in the field, their size makes them a bit of an easy target: the native Na’vi of Pandora were able to take them down with a variety of low-tech tactics.

Delta-6 Accelerator suit, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra

Set in the near future, 2009’s G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, shows a world that’s come under threat from a mysterious group called M.A.R.S., led by James McCullen (Christopher Eccelston). The G.I. Joe team is called out to help deal with the threat, and along the way, are provided with a couple of Delta-6 Accelerator suits.

These suits provide some armor to their wearers and provide them with an array of weapons, but have an emphasis on speed: Duke and Ripcord use them to zip around Paris. However, while they’re fast, they don’t appear to have been created in large numbers.

T-51b / T-60 power armor, Fallout

This set of armor was the standard issue for soldiers in the United States Army's Mechanized Cavalry Regiments before the Great War in the Fallout franchise. These suits carry with them a small fusion reactor for power, and can deflect laser blasts and conventional rounds.

However, in Fallout’s post-apocalyptic world, these advanced suits were harder to come by or maintain, and they’re largely used by the Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave. They’re also not invulnerable: they’ll degrade during a heated fight.

Scout Suit, John Steakley’s Armor

While the power armor in novels such as The Forever War and Starship Troopers are well known to science fiction fans, an underrated read is John Steakley’s 1984 novel Armor. In it, a soldier named Felix deals with the psychological stresses of interstellar warfare, equipped with a suit of armor called a Scout Suit, made up of a nearly indestructible material known as plassteel.

“Two meters tall, they weighed six times the norm. Their armored powered hands could crush steel, stone, bone. Armored legs could propel the fasted around 100 kilometers per standard hour. The suit protected them as well, automatically and instantly distributing most concussions in an evenly expanding patter from the point of impact to the entire surface of the armor. “

They’re also equipped with enough life support for three days, as well as a complement of guns and bombs. While these suits are nearly indestructible, Felix comes to fear the raw power at his disposal.

Crynet Nanosuit, Crysis

The Nanosuits used in the Crysis series equip soldiers on the battlefield with an enormous amount of power, thanks to the use of artificial CryFibril muscle fibers. These suits give their wearers incredible protection, strength and speed, as well as some really useful features, such as active camouflage. They can also enhance a wearer’s vision, and allow them to survive underwater.

The big downside to these? They bond right to their wearer, and they’re nearly impossible to remove without killing them, and if they’re at risk of falling into enemy hands, they can self-destruct.

Fighting Suit, Joe Haldeman’s The Forever War

One of the best military science fiction novels out there is Joe Haldeman’s The Forever War, which drew off of his own experiences fighting during the Vietnam War. In this book, Haldeman’s soldiers are equipped with what they call a Fighting Suit, which they describe as “the deadliest personal weapon ever built.”

These suits are powerful: they can theoretically rip a steel beam in half, and provide armor and life support for a soldier to operate in a variety of hostile environments. But trainees are warned: the suits are dangerous not only to their foes, but to themselves. If they’re not careful, mistakes can be fatal.

Goliath Mk Ⅲ Powersuit, James S.A. Corey’s The Expanse

In The Expanse, Mars possesses the most advanced military force in the solar system, and its elite Marines are trained to operate in deep space, onboard spaceships, and planetary surfaces. They come decked out in a powerful suit of armor called the Goliath Powersuit. This armor completely protects its wearer, providing life support and armor, as well as a heads up display to help soldiers with targeting. They also come equipped with guns mounted directly into their arms, and carry a small rack of missiles on their backs.

These suits will resist small arms fire, and are small enough that they can be used inside the narrow corridors of a spaceship. But they’re not invincible, as Bobbie Draper’s Marines discovered on Ganymede during the television show’s second season.

Prawn Bio-Suit, District 9

When the alien Prawns arrived on Earth in Neil Blomkamp’s 2009 film District 9, they bring with them an array of advanced weapons and technologies. One such piece of equipment is a Bio-Suit, a mechanized walker that comes loaded down with a number of guns and rockets.

After he was infected by a Prawn fluid that begins to transform him, Wikus van de Merwe gets into one of the suits while he’s on the run from a gang, and he uses it to kill his attackers. These suits can give a single soldier an edge in a firefight, but only Prawns (or people transforming into one) are the only ones who can use them. While they carry an impressive range of deadly weapons, they also aren’t invincible. As Wikus battles the MNU soldiers trying to capture him, the suit takes crippling damage from a sniper rifle, as well as rockets and a truck.

Iron Man Mark III and Variants, Iron Man

Marvel kicked off its cinematic universe with 2008’s Iron Man, in which Tony Stark, the head of defense contractor Stark Industries, is captured in Afghanistan. He escapes his captors by building a primitive armored suit, but after returning home, he refines the design and its capabilities. We see him use a huge range of suits over the course of several movies, which to serve a number of specialized purposes.

Stark’s Mark III armor is a powerful piece of equipment. Powered by an arc reactor embedded in Stark’s chest and managed by an AI, it can fly, carry incredible weight, and attack enemies with rockets, guns, hand-mounted repulsers, and a chest beam. The downside? While he has an entire house full of the suits, Stark is reluctant to lend them out to the government, and it’s safe to say that they’ll only work with him in control.

Trans-Developmental Biogenic Alloy, Karin Lowachee’s “Nomad”

In Karin Lowachee’s fantastic short story “Nomad” in John Joseph Adam’s 2012 anthology, Armored she introduces readers to an armored suit known as Radical Two (nicknamed Mad). Mad is part of a rogue band of armored soldiers, and when its human, Tommy, is killed, it decides to go nomad — striking out on its own — only to pick up an inexperienced kid.

These suits are pretty powerful, and mentally link up with their human operator. These suits of armor are sentient on their own, but they prefer to fuse with a human. They’re loaded down with weapons such as guns and grenades, and are incredibly hard to kill, with or without a human helping them.

MJOLNIR Powered Assault Armor, Halo

When humanity took to the stars in Bungie’s Halo franchise, the United Nations Space Command waged a constant war against an the Insurrectionists, and developed a super soldier program to augment their forces. The SPARTAN-II program enhanced and trained the soldiers who would wear the MJOLNIR armor, and they became a formidable force on the battlefield.

The Spartans are huge, covered in a tough armor that allows them to absorb shots from enemy soldiers, along with an energy shield that provides an additional level of protection. Their suits can also host an AI to support its wearer, and can interface with the weapons that they’re using, and despite their size, they’re incredibly agile, and present a formidable threat to the Covenant and Insurrectionists.

Mobile Infantry Powered Suits, Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers

It’s hard to beat the grandaddy of them all: the power armor at the center of Robert Heinlein’s novel Starship Troopers. Almost every instance of power armor in popular culture comes from Heinlein’s use.

Powered armor is one-half the reason we call ourselves “mobile infantry” instead of just “infantry.” Our suits give us better eyes, better ears, stronger backs (to carry heavier weapons and more ammo), better legs, more intelligence, more firepower, greater endurance, less vulnerability.

These suits can operate on a variety of planetary surfaces and environments, and come equipped not only with rifles and high explosives, but also tactical nuclear warheads that can eliminate an opponent in seconds. Let’s hope that the planned reboot of the film will include it this time.

Space Marine Power Armor, Warhammer 40K

While it’s hard to beat Heinlein’s mobile infantry, the Space Marines of Warhammer 40K will do the trick. Fighting for the Imperium of Man, they have been genetically modified, conditioned and trained to become the best soldiers on the galaxy. Standing two meters tall, they’re incredibly tough, and wear imposing armor made up of thick ceramite plates.

This suit of armor links to a wearer’s nervous system, and fully protects them from their outside environment, meaning that they can operate anywhere in the galaxy. It enhances their senses and allows them to carry incredibly powerful and heavy weapons into the field. If you see them on the battlefield, just walk away.","the

I realize this is a little bit like saying ""I don't enjoy fun,"" but I don't know, I've mostly just found the movies to be bad in a boring kind of way.

Point is, I'm not a huge fan of The Room. But I went to see The Disaster Artist anyway last week because it looked too fun to pass up. It really is a nice movie — and I think it succeeds largely thanks to one very smart decision: it never looks down on Tommy Wiseau. Even when Wiseau is being unreasonable and kind of a jerk, he's still made out to be worthy of admiration for putting himself out there in order to live his dream.

It's a nice message, and it really starts with scene one. James Franco opens the movie on Wiseau writhing around a stage floor in a bewildering bit of acting. The audience knows it’s bad, but the camera makes him look like a hero, the only one in the room willing to really go for it. Ultimately, I wish the movie revealed more about him, but the core choice of how to frame Wiseau makes the whole thing a joy to watch.

Check out nine trailers from this week below.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom

The new Jurassic World seems to have done at least one thing very right: it brings back Jeff Goldblum. And the team behind the movie seems to know just how right that move was, as this trailer is centered around Goldblum's voiceover. The rest of it shows a lot of dinosaurs and people making bad decisions. The movie comes out June 22nd.

Black Mirror

Netflix put out a full trailer for Black Mirror's fourth season this week, and it shows another series of cleanly, creepily shot near-futures and a lot of people looking sad and scared as it all inevitably goes awry. The new episodes come out December 29th.

Doctor Who Christmas Special

The BBC put out another look at this year's Doctor Who Christmas Special this week. And while it isn't all that revealing — clocking in at a brief 30 seconds long — it's nevertheless an exciting moment for Doctor Who fans, as it'll be the end of Peter Capaldi's stint in the role and the handoff to Jodie Whittaker, who'll be the first woman to play the Doctor. Naturally, it airs on Christmas.

Altered Carbon

Netflix's next big series is Altered Carbon, and this first look at it is pretty intriguing. The show takes place in a world where human consciousness can be transferred into a new body instead of dying, and the first season follows a soldier trying to solve an attempted murder. The book it's all based on was a big hit, so expect to hear more about this one in the coming months. The series comes out February 2nd.

Wormwood

Renowned documentary filmmaker Errol Morris is back with Wormwood, a very cool, very scary looking film about the CIA's infamous mind control program and the mysterious death of one man wrapped up in it. Real crime stories are super popular right now, and this seems like it could be one of the most fascinating stories Netflix has picked up yet. The film comes out December 15th.

You Were Never Really Here

My favorite shot in this trailer is of a jelly bean. It's so simple, but it gets across so much: it's slow, splintering, and oddly disturbing. The film, from director Lynne Ramsay, is about a war vet who seems to be a hitman who goes after men trafficking young girls. The film has great reviews so far, and it looks super creepy. It comes out April 6th.

7 Days in Entebbe

After spending a couple years working on Narcos, the director of the RoboCop reboot is back with a new film about the 1976 hostage crisis in Uganda, which began with a plane hijacking and ended with a largely successful Israeli rescue mission. The film seems to have a sort of an energetic heist movie vibe that's a lot less serious than the actual events might call for, but I suppose that makes for a much more fun movie. It comes out sometime in March.

Jack Ryan

Amazon released a short and sweet first look at its take on Jack Ryan, the Tom Clancy character who appeared in The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and a number of other big films. Notably, it is not the character Jack Reacher, who I assumed was the same until halfway through writing this blurb. Anyway, the show stars John Krasinski. I'm still not sure he can pull off this action-star reinvention, but I guess enough casting directors believe it. The show comes out at some point next year.

Lizzie Plaugic,"With Echo, Canogar explores subtle changes in our world",2017-12-09T15:00:02Z,the-verge,Artist Daniel Canogar visualizes real-time environmental shifts with LED sculptures,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/9/16751832/daniel-canogar-echo-art-exhibit-madrid-environment,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OdrERdtgxcciEFA7TYBPR3VgEuA=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9812567/akrales_170929_1977_0251.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"It sometimes seems like technology is at odds with the art world — a tension between brain and heart. But plenty of artists, from Da Vinci to Cory Arcangel, have proved that’s not true, and continue to prove it as technology evolves. In Technographica, we explore how contemporary artists are using technology in unusual and unexpected ways.

In his latest exhibition, Echo, Madrid-based artist Daniel Canogar is trying to make a point about how we interact with the world. The project, a series of abstract LED sculptures that react in real time to changes in the world, explores issues like deforestation, climate change, and pollution.

The exhibition consists of five sculptures. Each sculpture receives real-time data dedicated to certain environmental topics: air quality data, volcanic activity, wind changes in the city where a sculpture is installed, active fires, and rain data from 192 international cities. The sculptures are made of warped sheets of metal fitted with dozens of magnetic LED tiles that follow certain algorithmic patterns based on the data they receive.

“My entire project as an artist is always about the impact that technology has on us,” Canogar told The Verge. “About how we communicate, how we see the world, how we experience ourselves and our bodies and how’s that’s constantly being shifted and modified.”

Canogar says he spent two years finding flexible LED tiles that would be able to conform to the warped and twisted sheets of metal. After the tiles were affixed to the metal sculptures, Canogar used an algorithm to pull real-time data from various scientific websites that would determine how each piece would light up and display different patterns.

Each sculpture has “a personality,” Canogar says. The rain data sculpture, titled Basin, is molded into a concave shape, while the LED lights create blue ripples that are meant to “mimic the aesthetic qualities of a pond.” Ember, the sculpture that reacts to active fires, is shaped like a bonfire.

These twisted sheets of metal helps to give the artwork what Canogar calls a “creature-like,” appearance, each piece curved into a pose with exposed data cables hanging down like tails. “I want [viewers] to be almost sensually attracted to the work,” Canogar says. “Then once I have people’s attention, I’m hoping that they’ll think about the content, the data-driven information that’s gathered on the screen.”

The data isn’t necessarily meant to change anyone’s minds, or to take a political stance, he says, but rather to encourage viewers to spend some time thinking about what these data sets mean on a global scale.

Each sculpture in the series becomes a lifelike representation of our world, and humanity’s effect on it. Canogar said he wanted to see what would happen if we stopped seeing screens as screens, and instead as something more sentient. “Screens have taken on a new presence in our everyday life,” he says. “We tend to think of screens as this framed device, that we watch TV on, or a computer monitor. But it started to occur to me that it would be interesting to think of the screen as a membrane.”

Canogar is best known for large-scale public art installations, the largest of which was 2014’s Storming Times Square, a participatory video installation projected onto Times Square billboards. At the time, Canogar said of the piece, “Filming in Times Square has changed the way I think and feel about ‘the crowd.’ I have studied each and every one of the video captures of the participants, over 1,200 of them. They feel like friends and collaborators.”

With Echo, “the crowd” becomes a more intangible thing: sometimes responsible for changes in the environment, and sometimes just experiencing it. As for why he called the exhibit Echo, Canogar says it’s about the way the sculptures interact with the environment they’re representing. “I feel like they’re kind of listening to the planet. Of human phenomena but also natural phenomena,” he says. “They’re not really answering back, they’re just listening to the echoes.”

ECHO: A SERIES OF FIVE SCULPTURES

TROPOSPHERE

The LED visuals on Troposphere (above) react in real time to air quality readings in a particular city — in this case, Washington D.C. The more the color orange is displayed, the more polluted the air; the more blue, the less pollution is present. The information is updated every five seconds, drawing data from five different reading stations in the D.C. area.

EMBER

Ember displays visuals that are created by interpreting data from the number of uncontrolled fires burning around the world — which was approximately 3,500 at the last check, according to Canogar. The more fires burning, the faster the animation moves.

BASIN

The source of data for Basin is rainfall from 195 capital cities around the globe. Basin reacts to this data by moving slowly when a small amount of rain is falling and speeding up when more rain is recorded.

MAGMA

The patterns displayed on Magma are created by drawing data from the volcanic activity of over 600 volcanos from around the world. Volcanic activity is rated between 1 (dormant) to 5 (full eruption). Every time a volcano changes its rating, the lights on the panels change accordingly.

GUST

The LED lights on the surface of Gust react to wind speed data collected from pre-selected city — in this case, New York.","datadriven information

Nick Statt,"Guess who’s back, back again",2017-12-08T21:19:54Z,the-verge,Jony Ive is retaking control of Apple’s design team after two years in hands-off role,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/8/16753794/apple-jony-ive-design-management-role-change,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kIMMw7RkRxL66J6aU3AqWdU8iBY=/0x130:3600x2015/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9836741/858365818.jpg.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Jony Ive, technically Apple’s design chief since 2015, is once again assuming management control of the iPhone maker’s design team after two years in a largely hands-off role, according to a report from Bloomberg. Ive, responsible for the look and feel of Apple hardware throughout a majority of former CEO Steve Jobs’ revolutionary second run at the helm of the company in the late ‘90s and 2000s, was freed from much of his day-to-day management responsibilities in 2015, when he took on the chief design officer title. He still oversaw design, but other executives and employees on the team no longer reported to him.

At the time, the move was viewed as Ive, who is 50 years old, laying the groundwork to retire from his intensive position at Apple. However, it now appears that Ive is retaking control. Apple’s leadership webpage no longer lists Alan Dye, the vice president of user interface design, or Richard Howarth, vice president of industrial design, according to 9to5Mac. Both Dye and Howarth took on Ive’s management responsibilities when he stepped back two years ago.

“With the completion of Apple Park, Apple’s design leaders and teams are again reporting directly to Jony Ive, who remains focused purely on design,"" Apple told Bloomberg in a statement. So it appears Apple is claiming its newly opened spaceship campus as the culprit for Ive’s less product-focused time at the company these last two years.

Ive is reclaiming his management role at an especially telling time for Apple design

Yet his return to day-to-day management of Apple design comes at an especially telling time for the company, which has struggled recently to live up to its reputation for top-tier industrial hardware and software design. Starting in 2015 — or with iOS 7 in 2013, depending on who you ask — Apple has released a series of products with perplexing quirks and annoyances. The list includes a Magic Mouse that can only be charged when flipped upside down, an Apple Pencil stylus charging solution that has it sticking out of the Lightning connector of an iPad, and the now infamous iPhone X notch that cuts a hole in the top of the full-screen display. Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack with the iPhone 7 — and the dongle nightmare solutions required to keep living within the company’s ecosystem — has also inspired severe criticism over the company’s direction of late.

A number of tech industry journalists and critics have commented over the last two years on Apple’s apparent fall from grace by pointing the finger at its industrial design failures. Verge co-founder and former editor-in-chief Josh Topolsky wrote recently at The Outline, “Apple seems to have lost its knack for either envisioning the future, or expertly ripping off the people who do.” Apple’s core issue, he added, is that “the company is being buried under the weight of its products,” raising the question of whether “Apple’s unbridled and seemingly-endless success that has caused the company to rest on its laurels?”

Apple remains the most valuable company on the planet, with an eye-popping cash hoard of more than $250 billion and an all-time high stock price. The iPhone X is selling well, and the company continues to pump out record quarterly profits. But Ive’s willingness to jump back into management may signal something deeper about Apple’s willingness to correct course.","responsibilities

Rachel Becker,This new fossil joins a nightmare menagerie,2017-12-08T22:04:38Z,the-verge,This prehistoric ‘murder swan’ isn't the only terrifying dinosaur to haunt your nightmares,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/8/16752344/dinosaurs-fossils-murder-swan-halszkaraptor-escuilliei-velociraptor-paleontology,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M_xQGsXNtIuzf00JXi64pErcWEI=/0x598:5170x3305/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9837085/Halszkaraptor_Lukas_Panzarin.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"A newly discovered fossil from Mongolia made headlines this week, as the nightmare version of modern-day swans: it has a bill — with teeth. It has feet — with claws. And it has flipper-like arms — with extra claws. This turkey-sized dinosaur, dubbed Halszkaraptor escuilliei, waddled the Earth more than 70 million years ago, where it probably terrified all the prehistoric fish that darted past those clawed feet.

Called a “murder swan” by Ed Yong at The Atlantic, the odd-looking fossil was described this week in the journal Nature. But it’s not the weirdest-looking dinosaur to emerge from the Earth.

Here are a few highlights from the fossil record to add to this nightmare menagerie.

Beibeilong sinensis

The murder-swan is a reminder that modern-day birds are dinosaurs. They are descendants of small, hollow-boned dinos that ran around on two legs. One such ancient relative is Beibeilong sinensis, a 90-million-year-old dinosaur fetus discovered in China and nicknamed “Baby Louie.” Part of the Oviraptorosaur family of dinosaurs, the fetus would have grown into a birdlike creature that strutted around on stilt-like legs and tore at its food with a toothless beak.

With a short tail displaying a fan of feathers, it probably would look “like some kind of crazy turkey on steroids,” paleontologist Pete Makovicky told The Verge in May. Modern-day turkeys roaming in packs and circling dead cats are alarming enough, but this prehistoric version probably would have grown as large as its giant relative Gigantoraptor, which was 26 feet long and 16 feet tall. That’s one massive turkey.

Matheronodon provincialis

This 70-million-year-old dinosaur’s smile was scarier than its bite. Based on an eight-inch chunk of its jawbone and a few loose teeth discovered in France, paleontologists estimate that this toothy dinosaur grew to 16 feet long, and had massive, scissor-like chompers that sharpened themselves as the dino chewed. But these pearly whites probably weren’t for meat-eating; instead, researchers suspect that this dinosaur used its giant teeth to shear through fibrous leaves that other dinosaurs turned their noses up at.

Anzu wyliei

Described as a “chicken from hell” by National Geographic’s Christine Dell’Amore, this Oviraptorosaur was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation of North and South Dakota. It had a tall, bony crest on its head and stretched about 11 feet long. Like fellow Oviraptorosaur Baby Louie, it strutted around on two legs and and sported a toothless beak with ridged chewing surfaces. The team of paleontologists who first described A. wyliei, led by Matthew Lamanna at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, don’t know what this hellish chicken ate. But they did find the bones of small creatures and the shells of ancient mollusks next to one of the dinosaur’s skeletons, right where its belly would have been — a hint of what might have been on the menu for this 66-million-year-old feathered dinosaur.

Borealopelta markmitchelli (not Spike)

Accidentally discovered by a Canadian miner in 2011, this 110-million-year-old dinosaur was so well-preserved that it looked like it was sleeping. After 7,000 hours of painstaking conservation, paleontologists revealed that this creature was massive, covered in spikes — and a vegetarian. It stretched 18 feet long and probably weighed about 2,800 pounds. But despite its fearsome appearance, Michael Greshko at National Geographic called it “the rhinoceros of its day, a grumpy herbivore that largely kept to itself.”

With this family tree, is it any wonder that modern-day geese can be so terrifying?","borealopelta markmitchelli

The rocket is slated to take off from the company’s launch facility in New Zealand, and unlike the Electron’s first test flight, we’ll get to see this one go up live.

Rocket Lab has cautioned that since this is a test flight, the company won’t fly unless conditions are more than ideal for launch and only if the rocket is truly ready. There’s a 10-day launch window for this vehicle, and Rocket Lab has the option to fly sometime during a four-hour slot each day starting at 2:30PM NZT (or 8:30PM ET the day prior for those on the East Coast). The window officially opened on December 8th in New Zealand, and that’s when Rocket Lab rolled out the Electron to the launch pad for final preparations. However, the company has waited until today due to weather concerns.

The company’s live stream will go live 15 minutes prior to launch, so you’ll want to keep your eye on Rocket Lab’s Twitter to see when this vehicle tries to make it to space. If this launch goes well, Rocket Lab may consider itself done with test flights altogether and forge ahead with commercial missions. The company plans to live stream those launches, too, so expect many more shows from New Zealand next year.

Update December 10th, 6:30PM ET: This article has been updated to include Rocket Lab’s new launch time.","rocket

When we came across one of their products on Indiegogo last year, we noted that crowdsourced Internet of Things devices have a troubling history of being insecure. Recently, security firm Two Six Labs picked up one of Vaultek’s connected safes, and demonstrated that it can easily be cracked open.

The security company tested out a Vaultek VT20i safe, which owners can lock with a PIN and pair with an Android App. The app uses a pairing code that is the same as the PIN, and allows an unlimited number of attempts to get in. The lab was able to write a program to use brute force to guess the password. Furthermore, the researchers found that the connection between the phone and the safe aren’t encrypted (contrary to the Vaultek’s claims), meaning that the information could be intercepted. They also discovered that the safe doesn’t verify a PIN code coming from the paired phone, which means that it can be unlocked with the right command, even if the PIN is incorrect.

The lab published its findings in a blog post after Vaultek issued issued a firmware update that capped the number of attempts for the PIN, and encrypted the transmissions between the app and safe.","bluetoothconnected

WASHINGTON—Some high-income business owners could face marginal tax rates exceeding 100% under the Senate’s tax bill, far beyond the listed tax rates in the Republican plan.

That means a business owner’s next $100 in earnings, under certain circumstances, would require paying more than $100 in additional federal and state taxes.

As lawmakers rush to write the final tax bill over the next week, they already are looking at changes to prevent this from happening. Broadly, House and Senate Republicans are trying to reconcile the bills they passed, looking for ways to pay for eliminating the most contentious proposals. The formal House-Senate conference committee will meet Wednesday, and GOP lawmakers may unveil an agreement by the end of the week.

The possible marginal tax rate of more than 100% results from the combination of tax policies designed to provide benefits to businesses and families but then deny them to the richest people. As income climbs and those breaks phase out, each dollar of income faces regular tax rates and a hidden marginal rate on top of that, in the form of vanishing tax breaks. That structure, if maintained in a final law, would create some of the disincentives to working and to earning business profits that Republicans have long complained about, while opening lucrative avenues for tax avoidance.

As a taxpayer’s income gets much higher and moves out of those phaseout ranges, the marginal tax rates would go down.

Consider, for example, a married, self-employed New Jersey lawyer with three children and earnings of $615,000. Getting $100 in business income beyond that amount would force the lawyer to pay $105.45 in federal and state taxes, according to calculations by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. That is more than double the marginal tax rate that household faces today.

If the New Jersey lawyer’s stay-at-home spouse wanted a job, the first $100 of the spouse’s wages would require $107.79 in taxes. And the tax rates for similarly situated residents of California and New York City would be even higher, the Tax Foundation found. Analyses by the Tax Policy Center, which is run by a former Obama administration official, find similar results, with federal marginal rates as high as 85%, and those don’t include items such as state taxes, self-employment taxes or the phase-out of child tax credits.

The bill as written would provide incentives for business owners to shift profits across calendar years, move personal expenses inside the business and engage in other economically unproductive maneuvers, said David Gamage, a tax-law professor at Indiana University.

“I would expect a huge tax-gaming response once people fully understand how it works,” said Mr. Gamage, a former Treasury Department official, who said business owners have an easier time engaging in such tax avoidance than salaried employees do. “The payoff for gaming is huge, within the set of people who both face these rates and have flexible enough business structures.”

The analyses “raise a valid concern” that lawmakers are examining, said Julia Lawless, a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee.

“With any major reform, there will always be unusual hypotheticals delivering anomalous results,” she said. “The goal of Congress’s tax overhaul has been to lower taxes on the American people and by and large, according to a variety of analyses, we’re achieving that.”

Marginal tax rates are different from average tax rates. A marginal rate is the tax on the edge, or margin, of one’s earnings, and so it reflects what would be the next dollar of income. The average rate is a way of measuring a taxpayer’s total burden.

The Republican bills are trying to reduce both marginal and average tax rates, and for many taxpayers, they do. The marginal tax rates above 100% affect a small slice of households with very particular circumstances. Similar, though smaller, effects occur throughout the tax system.

“This is a big concern,” said Scott Greenberg, a Tax Foundation analyst. “It would be unfortunate if Congress passed a tax bill that had the effect of making additional work and additional income not worthwhile for any subgroup of households.”

Here’s how that New Jersey lawyer’s marginal rate adds up to more than 100%:

—The household is paying the 35% marginal tax rate on their income range. Or, they are paying the alternative minimum tax, which operates at the same marginal rate in that income range.

—The household is paying New Jersey’s highest income-tax rate, which is 8.97%, and now has to pay all of that because the Republican tax plan wouldn’t let such state or local taxes be deducted from federal income.

—The household is also losing a deduction the Senate created for so-called pass-through businesses such as partnerships and S corporations. That 23% deduction is fully available to owners of service businesses like law firms, but only if income is below $500,000 for a married couple.

The deduction then phases out over $100,000 in income, according to a complex formula, disappearing entirely once income reaches $624,000. Up to that point, each additional dollar of business income faces progressively steeper tax rates because the deduction and its benefit are shrinking rapidly as income goes up.

The provisions also interact with each other in ways that drive up marginal rates. “The central problem here is that there is a large benefit phasing out over a short range,” Mr. Greenberg said.

—The Republican bill doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 but phases it out beginning at $500,000 income for joint filers. The credit shrinks by $50 for every $1,000 in income above that, so a married couple with three children faces a higher marginal tax rate when they’re in that phase-out range.

—The analysis assumes that the New Jersey lawyer is paying a 3.8% tax on self-employment income.

Pushing marginal tax rates lower on these households wouldn’t be easy and would require tradeoffs. Republicans could make the phase-out of the business deduction more gentle, spreading it over, say, $200,000, as opposed to $100,000, of income above $500,000.

But that would make the tax cuts bigger, and Republicans are already looking for money to offset other changes they are planning.

They could lower the threshold for the child tax credit, but that would reduce tax cuts for households below $500,000.

Under current law, there are some high marginal tax rates for some lower-income households. Some families just above the poverty line can see their earned income tax credits and food stamps going down as their federal and state taxes go up. That combination can create marginal tax rates of around 75%, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

President Trump has jumped into a contentious Senate race here in recent days, supporting embattled Republican Roy Moore in an election that neared the finish line Sunday under the glare of a national spotlight.

Trump’s 11th-hour imprint was splashed across the front pages of the state’s biggest newspapers over the weekend, as he championed Moore at a rally across the state border with Florida, recorded a phone call urging voters to vote Republican and branded Moore’s Democratic opponent a “Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat” to his more than 44 million followers on Twitter.

But even as Trump has remained popular among Republican voters in this staunchly conservative state — and a troubling figure to many Democrats — it was unclear as the campaigns honed their closing arguments over the weekend how much impact the president would have in a race that has become all about Moore.

A long-polarizing figure, Moore’s reputation for controversy grew last month after The Washington Post published the accounts of four women who said Moore made advances toward them when they were teens and he was in his 30s. One of the accusers said she was 14 at the time.

Several voters said in brief interviews on Sunday that Trump was not a leading factor in their decision. Democrats said their vote reflected their protest of Moore’s positions and controversies, while Republicans said they admire Moore for weathering accusations they think are false, for his conservatism and for refusing to give into the Republican establishment.

In Blount County, where Trump won nearly 90 percent of vote last year, several Republicans running errands and having lunch said that they had decided to vote for Moore long before Trump told them to do so — and despite the published reports.

“I think the voters have basically made their minds up because they see through this garbage,” said David Clevenger, 61, a Moore supporter who also voted for Trump last year, and who said he does not believe the women who have accused Moore. Asked what impact Trump’s endorsement will make at this point, he shook his head and said: “None.”

His wife of more than 40 years, Teresa Clevenger, agreed and added: “We believe in thinking for ourselves.”

More than 35 miles southwest in Democrat-heavy Birmingham, Chris and Debbie Soniat, a married couple who have been volunteering for candidate Doug Jones, said in an interview that their vote is more about stopping Moore than it is about stopping Trump.

“In a way, Roy Moore is just his own, weird — I mean, I think he would institute sort of his own version of sharia law if he had he the chance, you know?” said Chris Soniat, 68, a self-identified independent. “Banning homosexuality. Banning Muslims from participating.”

“To me, he represents the worst of the values of the Old South,” said Debbie Soniat, speaking of Moore.

The 65-year-old nurse, a Democrat, said the outcome of the 2016 election has spurred her to be more politically active. She traveled to Washington for the Women’s March with her daughter and is trying to stay active in politics.

She said she is worried that Trump’s late push is helping Moore.

“I’m afraid it is,” she said.

Yet Trump’s support has been qualified. While the president has made a big push for Moore, he has done so from afar — avoiding joint photo ops or other visuals that could haunt Trump if Moore loses. Trump appears to be setting himself up to claim credit if Moore wins while allowing himself to claim some distance if Moore loses.

[Shelby bucks his party and president to oppose Moore for Senate]

With just two days left until Tuesday’s election, Jones and Moore took sharply different approaches. Moore stayed off the campaign trail while Jones barnstormed the state with an entourage of high-profile African American surrogates.

In Birmingham, Jones addressed supporters alongside Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a potential 2020 presidential candidate. They did not mention Trump in their pitch inside a packed campaign office, where the smell of pizza wafted through the air and organizers geared up for a busy afternoon of phone calls and canvassing.

Instead, they sought to hit aspirational notes about Alabama putting its best foot forward.

“Don’t let anyone tell you this is an election of choices to what Alabama wants to be. It is not that. We know who we are, Alabama,” Jones said. “This is an election to tell the world who we are.”

Booker called the race one of “the most consequential elections” of his lifetime and took an implicit dig at Moore.

“Please, I’m from Jersey,” Booker said. “We definitely don’t want some people just singling out a few folks on the ‘Jersey Shore’ TV show and thinking that’s my entire state. No, there is goodness and decency and mercy and love here.”

When a reporter asked Jones afterward about Trump’s recent criticism of him, Jones avoided engaging with the president — much as he has throughout the campaign.

“I don’t have a message to President Trump,” Jones said, before quickly pivoting to other topics. It’s been a strategy of necessity in a state that leans far to the right and where a Democratic upset is possible only by winning an ample share of crossover Republicans.

In a state where ideological conservatism and passionate opposition to abortion define the GOP, many of those Republican voters are expected to remain out of reach to Jones, who supports abortion rights.

Trump has not been shy about picking a fight. He has repeatedly branded Jones as an ally of polarizing national Democratic figures including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York.

If Jones wins on Tuesday, the GOP’s Senate majority would narrow to 51-49, making the already difficult task of shepherding a legislative agenda even tougher for Trump.

Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said Trump recorded a call supporting Moore on Saturday. On Friday, Trump touted Moore at a rally in Pensacola, Fla. His appearance was widely covered by Alabama news outlets.

The Moore campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the recorded calls.

Moore has eagerly embraced Trump’s campaign on his behalf and has cast himself as a natural ally of the president who will go to Washington and immediately champion his agenda.

The former judge seemed keen on letting Trump lead the way for him down the stretch. Moore did not host any publicly announced events over the weekend, and his tweets have pertained almost exclusively to the president’s support.

Senate GOP leaders have called on Moore to drop out of the race after a series of accusations that Moore, now 70, aggressively pursued teenage girls when he was in his 30s.

Moore has denied the accusations and said in an interview with a local television station over the weekend that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct were engaged in “ritual defamation” against him.

“I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I have never molested anyone,” Moore said. “When I saw the pictures on the advertisements of my opponent, I did not recognize any of these people.”

Moore has spoken inconsistently about the allegations against him, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity in a radio interview last month that he may have dated young girls years ago — with parental permission — but that he did not recall dating any of the women who had accused him of making unwanted advances when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. He said in that interview that he knew two of the women when they were teens, and described each as a “good girl.”

Moore said a victory for him would end the story.

“I’ve stood up for moral values, so they’re attacking me in that way,” he said. “When this race is over, on the 12th of December, it will be over.”

While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore’s Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls. Over the ensuing three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed four women. All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore. The women said they did not know one another.

Senate Republican leaders have been grappling with difficult questions about what to do if Moore is elected on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has said that the Senate Ethics Committee — a panel of three Republican and three Democratic senators — could swiftly begin investigating the accusations against Moore.

Trump’s involvement in the campaign seems to have followed the mood in the state as documented through polling and media reports.

In the Republican primary, Trump endorsed Moore’s rival, Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed by the governor to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump quickly endorsed and embraced Moore once he became the nominee — but then authorized the Republican National Committee to pull funding from the race when accusations emerged last month.

Trump refused to answer any questions about Moore, although the White House did not withdraw his endorsement. After Moore stayed in the race and polls tightened, Trump started attacking Jones — and then, after testing the waters, started once again directly telling voters to vote for Moore. He also directed the RNC to jump back in.

“A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night,” Trump tweeted on Saturday. “We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat, Jones, in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.”

Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) stops to speak to reporters before votes on the Senate floor, on Capitol Hill, on Nov. 15, 2017. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

When Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama came hat in hand to Capitol Hill last month to ask his state’s senior Republican for help raising money, Sen. Richard C. Shelby had a blunt reply.

“I told him he could raise it himself, you know like I did, you know like everybody else,” said Shelby, who has about $10 million cash in his campaign account, with no prospects of a competitive reelection.

The striking rebuff was no surprise to those who know Shelby well. Since the surfacing of allegations of Moore’s sexual misconduct, Shelby has publicly bucked President Trump and the rest of Alabama’s statewide Republican leaders by vocally opposing Moore’s candidacy, which he warns could hurt the state he has spent his life transforming.

“He thrives on controversy, seems to me. And I think you can’t be a formidable, effective senator if you’re so controversial your colleagues avoid you,” Shelby told The Washington Post in an interview last week, after casting an absentee ballot for an unnamed Republican write-in candidate instead of Moore. “That’s the bottom line.”

Shelby took that same message to the national airwaves on Sunday, telling CNN’s State of the Union that the accusers against Moore, including a woman who says he touched her sexually when she was 14, “are believable.”

“I think Alabama deserves better,” Shelby said.

The two men have moved in similar circles for decades, working together at times. Both are strictly antiabortion, support conservative fiscal policies, tougher immigration rules and favor loosening rules on gun ownership along with increased military spending. Both men favor getting rid of the Senate rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation to pass.

When Moore sparked a legal crisis by displaying the Ten Commandments in a state courthouse, Shelby worked with Moore to introduce the Constitution Restoration Act, a bill that would have blocked the federal judiciary’s ability to prevent federal employees from acknowledging “God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government.”

But Shelby says he had concerns about Moore long before the allegations of sexual misconduct. One concern was Moore’s willingness as a judge to disobey judicial orders with which he disagreed, a tactic that led state officials to twice remove Moore from the bench.

“At one time, I was a U.S. magistrate in my day, you know a young guy, and I believe in the rule of law,” said Shelby. “I disagree with a lot of court decisions, and even a lot of statutory things I don’t like, but still it’s the law.”

Another Shelby concern is the effect that Moore’s candidacy, and possible election, would have on the reputation of a state. Over 30 years, through earmarks and other legislative maneuvering, Shelby has directed hundreds of millions of dollars to Alabama to help re-create it as a forward-leaning, business-friendly destination for the high-tech manufacturing, biotechnology and aerospace industries.

“I think the image of anything matters,” Shelby said. “It’s not 1860. It’s not 1900. It’s not 1940. It’s not 1964 or 1965. It’s 2017. And Alabama in a lot of ways is on the cutting edge, on the cusp of a lot of good things.”

Friends and allies of Shelby describe the significant turmoil Moore has caused in the state’s political and business elite. Business leaders have expressed concern that the current campaign could hurt the branding of the state, which has been experiencing significant economic gains in recent years.

“We want to be attractive to the smartest people in the country,” said Fines “Fess” St. John, an attorney in Cullman, who sits on the board of the University of Alabama and has worked with Shelby. “I’m sure the senator is concerned that something that distracts from that narrative doesn’t help us.”

The fact that Shelby may not stand again for reelection may have also affected his willingness to go public with his concerns. Elected with 64 percent of the vote in 2016, Shelby, 83, is not set to face reelection after the winner of Tuesday’s election will once again have to face voters in 2020. “I got five years to go,” he says of his own plans. “If I live and am blessed to live and am effective, that would be a good five years.”

Despite his vocal opposition, Shelby says he thinks Moore will probably be elected Tuesday, and he will work with him as best he can. “We would all hope if he came up here and became ensconced as a senator that he would work with us,” Shelby said.

But in the meantime, he will continue to speak his piece, making an argument at the core of his own professional legacy: The history of the South should not bind its future.

“We are the Deep South. We are part of the Confederacy. My great grandfather was a captain in the Confederate army, but so was everybody else,” said Shelby. “It’s are part of who we are. Yet there is a future out there.”

“What caused the changes?” he continued. “People want a better life.”

“I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I have never molested anyone,” Moore said in an interview filmed at the Alabama Republican Party’s headquarters in suburban Birmingham. “When I saw the pictures on the advertisements of my opponent, I did not recognize any of these people.”

Moore has spoken inconsistently about the allegations against him, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity last month that he may have dated young girls years ago — with parental permission — but that he did not know any of the women who have accused him of making unwanted advances when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. Although Senate Republicans have pledged to hold ethics hearings if Moore wins the election, Moore said a victory for him would end the story.

“I’ve stood up for moral values, so they’re attacking me in that way,” he said. “When this race is over, on the 12th of December, it will be over.”

While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore’s Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls. Over the ensuing three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed four women. All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore. The women say they don’t know one another.

[As Alabama prepares to vote, Republican Sen. Richard Shelby says state ‘deserves better’ than Moore]

As he has said repeatedly in a small number of public appearances since the stories broke last month, Moore suggested in the TV interview that his accusers are part of a smear campaign. He claimed incorrectly that they had participated in attack ads run against him. Several accusers have given TV interviews, but only their photographs have appeared in the spots aired by Democratic nominee Doug Jones.

“It’s inconceivable to think that someone would wait 40 years because they were embarrassed or ashamed or something, and then less than 30 days before the general election, come out and make allegations — and then appear on a political advertisement, when they’ve waited 40 years not to be embarrassed,” Moore said.

Over the rest of the largely friendly interview — Britt joked that no “living” Democrats would help Jones if they came to stump in Alabama — Moore repeatedly said Jones was trying to divert voters from the core issue of judicial appointments.

“I would want judges who recognize that Roe v. Wade, although it has been around since 1973, is not the supreme law of the land because it contradicts the right to life given to us in our founding documents,” he said.

Moore last appeared at a campaign rally Tuesday, when former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon flew in to the Mobile area to stump for him. The Republican nominee’s next public appearance is scheduled for Monday evening, with Bannon making another visit.","supreme law of the land

Now that the Senate and the House have passed two tax bills, there are some crucial differences they need to resolve in conference before they can send the bill to President Trump's desk. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)

Republicans are moving their tax plan toward final passage at stunning speed, blowing past Democrats before they’ve had time to fully mobilize against it but leaving the measure vulnerable to the types of expensive problems popping up in their massive and complex plan.

Questionable special-interest provisions have been stuffed in along the way, out of public view and in some cases literally in the dead of night. Drafting errors by exhausted staff are cropping up and need fixes, which must be tackled by congressional negotiators working to reconcile competing versions of the legislation passed separately by the House and the Senate.

And the melding process underway has opened the door to another frenzy of 11th-hour lobbying as special interests, including President Trump’s rich friends, make one last dash for cash before the final bill speeds through both chambers of Congress and onto Trump’s desk. Passage is expected the week before Christmas.

Veterans of congressional tax overhauls, particularly the seminal revamp under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, have been stunned and in some cases outraged at how swiftly Republicans are moving on legislation that touches every corner of the economy and all Americans. And although GOP leaders make no apologies, some in their rank and file say that the process would have benefited from a more deliberate and open approach.

“I think it would have looked better if we had taken more time and had more transparency, had more open committee hearings,” said freshman Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.).

“Having said that, the goal that everybody had was to reduce the tax rates. . . . So at the end of the day the goal is going to be achieved, but we could have done it in a more transparent manner that probably would have given the voters that are being polled a little more confidence,” Comer said, referring to the effort’s poor showing in opinion surveys.

It has been a little more than a month since the $1.5 trillion legislation was introduced in the House, and in that short time it has cleared the two key committees in the House and Senate and won approval on the floors of both chambers, all without a single Democratic vote. If Trump signs the bill as planned before Christmas, that would mean a journey of less than two months between introduction and final passage.

The specific legislation that probably will become law, sold as a middle-class tax cut but featuring a massive corporate rate reduction at its center, is moving from release toward passage without any hearings, unusual for a bill of such magnitude. And as it tumbled along it picked up some startling new features, to the surprise of affected industries, Democrats and in some cases Republicans themselves.

Some of the most notable changes came in the hours before the Senate’s passage of its version of the plan, which happened about 1:50 a.m. Dec. 2.

The final vote was preceded by hours of inaction as Republicans fine-tuned their legislation behind closed doors, while fuming Democratic staffers ate Chinese food and pored over versions of the bill and lists of amendments that had been leaked by lobbyists on K Street before Republicans had made anything public.

As they got additional drafts of the bill, Democrats were incensed at some of what they found, including new breaks for the oil and gas industry, and a provision that appeared aimed specifically at helping Hillsdale College, a small liberal arts college in Michigan that doesn’t accept federal funding and has a large endowment funded by wealthy conservatives — including the family of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

An angry Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stood on his chamber’s floor to declare that “the federal treasury is being looted.” In their one victory of the debate, Democrats offered an amendment to strike the Hillsdale provision, and with the help of four Republicans it passed.

Democrats weren’t the only ones surprised by what was in the bill. Republicans and the business community were stunned when the final Senate version restored the alternative minimum tax for corporations. The tax, aimed at keeping companies from shirking their tax duties entirely, had been repealed in the House bill and earlier versions of the Senate measure.

Restoring the corporate alternative minimum tax created $40 billion in revenue for the bill, which helped Republicans come in under complex budgetary guidelines saying the legislation can’t go over the $1.5 trillion the GOP has agreed to add to the deficit over the next decade. Still, some Republicans professed not to know how the change had come about.

And under the new tax code the GOP bill would create, including the alternative minimum tax could have the unintended consequence of preventing companies from using other deductions, including the popular research and development tax credit.

“I’m guessing they just needed something quick to make the bill work,” said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who is one of the conferees charged with blending the two bills together.

Now, as quickly as it reappeared, the corporate alternative minimum tax probably will disappear again. Republican lawmakers widely agree that it doesn’t work and can’t be included, but it remains a mystery where they’ll find revenue to offset that change and pay for others they’re looking to include in the final package.

There has been discussion of moving the corporate rate — slashed from 35 percent to 20 percent by the House and Senate — back up to 22 percent, but the backlash against that proposal has been intense and it probably will be dropped. But revenue must be found somewhere because there are some changes that look nearly certain, including adjusting the new limit on deducting state and local taxes. Both the House and Senate legislation would allow taxpayers to deduct only up to $10,000 in property taxes. Some of Trump’s New York friends have taken exception to that provision and have lobbied the president personally against it.

It’s all part of a breakneck pace of the tax plan that contrasts with the nearly a year-and-a-half that passed between when Reagan unveiled his initial version of the 1986 tax plan and its ultimate passage into law. The less far-ranging tax cuts that President George W. Bush signed in 2001 took four months to become law after the release of Bush’s initial blueprint. And the Affordable Care Act took nearly a year to complete, including a congressional summer recess featuring angry town hall meetings that turned public sentiment sharply against the bill.

Democrats accuse Republicans of whisking the legislation along to avoid extended public scrutiny and prevent them from mounting an offensive at public hearings or over lengthy congressional breaks. The GOP bills have endured neither.

“It’s clear that we could have defeated this bill had we gone through regular order and had any expert witness from any blue state or high-tax state come in,” said Rep. John B. Larson (Conn.), who was a member of Democratic leadership during the much lengthier and more open process of passing the ACA. The provision limiting taxpayers’ ability to deduct state and local taxes hits high-tax areas such as California, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut particularly hard.

“People would have said, ‘Well, wait a minute,’ ” Larson said.

Republican congressional leaders dispute such comparisons, saying that the process on taxes has been going on for years, given that the party has long been debating the idea and an early foundational bill was released by then-Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), former chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, nearly four years ago. House Republicans, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), also campaigned last year on an agenda called “A Better Way,” which featured a tax plank similar in many respects to the bill the House ultimately passed, although it drew scant attention at the time.

“These are relatively small bills, 400 pages or so; they’re not hard to digest. The policy decisions, the thoughtfulness, a lot of these issues we’ve been debating together and apart for years,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.). “Bottom line is the American people have been waiting 30 years. So to paraphrase a hardware store: less talking, more doing.”

Even before the late-night Senate dramatics, the process offered surprises and sudden twists.

A provision repealing an Affordable Care Act requirement for most Americans to carry insurance or pay fines was added to the Senate bill with little warning over the course of an afternoon, a major health policy decision that is projected to leave 13 million more Americans uninsured in a decade but that would give Republicans $330 billion to pay for other things they want to do.

And the release of the House bill stunned manufacturers when they discovered it contained an “excise tax” on purchases from American companies’ foreign subsidiaries that some said could drive them out of business. The provision was watered down before passage by the Ways and Means Committee, but companies are still fighting to keep it out of the final bill, said Nancy McLernon, president of the Organization for International Investment, which represents global companies with U.S. operations. Despite the years-long focus on tax overhaul, such a provision had not been debated — even after companies beat back a different import tax, she said.

The Senate has a different provision that companies like better, but as far as the cost of going from one to the other or how it will all shake out, “It’s all a Rubik’s cube,” McLernon said.

Many lobbyists, Democrats and other observers expect to find the final version of the plan, which could be filed late this week, just as full of surprises as the various iterations that have appeared. But as they gun for a legislative win that has eluded them this year, Republicans show little interest in slowing down to take a closer look.

“The frenzy, and I would call it a frenzy, to get it done and have a Christmas present for America — number one, I think it’s unnecessary; it’s a self-imposed deadline, and number two, it makes the possibility for error much greater,” said Steve Bell, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center who was staff director of the Senate Budget Committee during the 1986 tax effort. “This is a rush without a reason other than the political desire for a Rose Garden signing ceremony.”

"Heather Long, Heather Long",The House proposed eliminating the medical deduction. The Senate wants to expand it.,2017-12-10T08:14:00Z,the-washington-post,"Analysis | ‘Very, very scary’: 8.8 million Americans face big tax hike if Republicans scrap the medical deduction",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/10/very-very-scary-8-8-million-americans-face-big-tax-hike-if-republicans-scrap-the-medical-deduction/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2017/12/Randy-plus-mom.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"

Randy Sherfy has lived in a traumatic care facility since a driver hit him when he was 41. Cecilia “Sis” Tunnell has Alzheimer’s and requires intensive care. Both would end up paying thousands of dollars more in taxes if the medical deduction goes away, their families say. (Sherfy photo courtesy of Joe Sherfy; Tunnell photo courtesy of Mary Pagel).

Anne Hammer is one of millions of elderly Americans who could face a substantial tax hike in 2018 depending on the final negotiations over the Republican tax bill.

In her retirement community in Chestertown, Md., it’s the big topic of conversation.

Hammer is 71. Like many seniors, her medical bills are piling up. There are doctor visits, insurance premiums, drugs, a colonoscopy, a heart scan, an unexpected trip to the emergency room that lasted three days, ongoing monitoring for breast and ovarian cancer that run in her family and the costs of medical staff at her retirement community. Her out-of-pocket medical expenses vary, but she estimates they are about $20,000 a year.

Under current law, she can take a big medical deduction on her taxes. Last year, she was able to reduce her total taxable income by $16,000 because of the medical deduction alone, saving her over $3,000 on her tax bill.

The House tax bill would eliminate the deduction, while the Senate bill would keep it (and even make it a bit more generous). It’s a key difference that must be reconciled before the final legislation goes to President Trump.

“I have enough money to last until I’m 95,” says Hammer, who has carefully saved for decades. “But if I have to pay that much more in taxes, I might run out of money by 85.”

An ‘extraordinary’ deduction

The medical deduction started in 1942 to help Americans deal with what lawmakers at the time called the “extraordinary” costs of medical care, the kind that hit when someone in the family has cancer or needs round-the-clock care. Currently, anyone can deduct medical expenses that account for more than 10 percent of their adjusted gross income (income minus deductions and exemptions). The Senate bill would expand that to 7.5 percent of income for this year and next.

In 2015, 8.8 million Americans used the deduction. Over half were older than 65, according to AARP.

As soon as Hammer, a former university administrator and MetLife compliance manager, read about the House plan, she realized it would alter not just her taxes, but possibly her life. She has income from Social Security, a modest pension and private retirement accounts. She pulls in about $55,000 a year, enough to pay for her retirement community and her medical bills.

But if she loses the medical deduction, her taxable income would jump — and so would her taxes. Her home state of Maryland bases its taxes off the federal ones, so losing the medical deduction at the federal level would lead to more taxes at the state level as well. The more money that goes to taxes, the less she has to live on later in life.

“It’s very, very scary,” says Hammer. It would be even worse if her medical costs go up. She already anticipates eye surgery and a dental procedure next year.

Trump promised that the middle class would be better off under his plan, but scrapping this deduction hits some in that group. Nearly 70 percent of the people claiming the deduction made $75,000 or less, according to AARP.

“This isn’t a high-income deduction,” says Cristina Martin Firvida, director of financial security and consumer affairs at AARP, which has been running ad campaigns to urge Congress to keep the deduction.

A ‘very important’ issue

House Republicans had previously argued that their tax overhaul would be so beneficial to families that individual provisions such as the medical deduction would no longer be necessary. But more recently, they have acknowledged the significant impact of eliminating this particular tax break.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), the lead author of the House bill, said last week that the medical deduction is on his radar heading into the conference committee because many of his fellow GOP lawmakers have contacted him about it.

“That issue is being raised a lot by our lawmakers as very important,” Brady said.

Eliminating the medical deduction raises $10 billion a year — about 7 percent of the cost of reducing the tax rate for corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent, as the tax overhauls do.

‘Freaks me out’

Losing the deduction is especially burdensome for families caring for someone with a chronic disease. Cecilia “Sis” Tunnell is 88 and has Alzheimer’s. Her daughter Mary Pagel runs a thriving accounting practice in San Luis Obispo, Calif., and moved her mom to a nursing home nearby. The facility, specialized care and a nurse cost over $130,000 last year, a hefty sum the family can pay because of years of careful planning.

Pagel handles her mother’s taxes and estimates that Tunnell would go from paying less than $2,300 in taxes last year to paying more than $50,000 if the House plan went into effect and the medical deduction went away, because her mother’s taxable income would jump by six figures.

Many other clients of Pagel’s have been calling her with similar concerns. It alters the math dramatically, even for families that have saved for years to fund top-notch care that doesn’t rely on the government.

“It freaks me out,” says Pagel. “The costs of medical care are not going to go down, and you just don’t know how long someone will need care with Alzheimer’s or another chronic illness.”

‘Victim of an accident’

While most of the focus has been on the elderly, Americans of all ages would be affected if the tax deduction is lost.

Randy Sherfy was a former college athlete and a rising star at a law firm when he left his home on a Saturday morning in 1992 to go on a bike ride with friends. A driver hit him a few miles from his home. He was 41.

Many surgeries later, his body has been mostly repaired, but Sherfy never recovered from the brain injury. He has been living in a traumatic care facility in Texas that costs over $60,000 a year. He pays for it from income from a settlement with a driver and from disability insurance he had from his law firm.

His brother, an accountant in Austin, estimates Sherfy’s taxes would go up substantially without the medical tax deduction. In most years from 2007 to 2014, he paid almost no taxes because of the medical deduction, his brother says. Under the House bill, he would suddenly have taxable income of $60,000 a year.

About a quarter of people who claim the medical deduction are younger than 50, according to AARP.

“Most of the people in nursing homes don’t have a lot of choice of how they’re spending their dollars,” says Joe Sherfy, Randy’s brother. “He was the victim of an accident.”

It’s Chef Majed’s second time at work today. Fasting makes the daytime heat of the kitchen too hard to manage, and so he was in the kitchen preparing orders late last night, into the early morning.

Abdulraheem, 29, works at Foodhini, a meal delivery service that employs immigrant chefs in Washington. The start-up was founded by Noobtsaa Philip Vang, a child of refugees from Laos, who discovered, after arriving from Minnesota to Georgetown three years ago to get his MBA, that he was missing the Hmong cuisine he grew up with. “I was really craving some of my mom’s food,” says Vang, “and I was thinking I wanted to find a grandma or auntie that was living in the neighborhood somewhere and just buy some of their food.”

He started mulling his own family’s immigration story: When his mom came to the United States, she had limited English skills, and finding work was difficult. His dad sometimes worked multiple jobs, sleeping in his car between shifts, to make sure the family had enough money to survive. What his mother did have, which might have been marketable if only she’d had the resources, was incredible skill as a chef. “There’s got to be a way to create opportunities for people like my mom,” he thought.

Abdulraheem is one of Foodhini’s first chefs. On its website, he offers a menu of his own design: bamiatan, a dish of crisp mini okra sauteed in garlic and topped with cilantro; mutabbal, an eggplant-tahini dip similar to baba ghanouj; and kebab hindi, meatballs cooked in a spiced tomato stew. Like Vang, his love for food and for family are inextricably intertwined: Many of the items on Abdulraheem’s menu are dishes his mother used to make for him when he was a kid growing up in a small town in southern Syria. Even after attending culinary school in Syria, and after years of working in restaurants, he still considers her, his original teacher, to be the better chef.

“You have to love cooking to be good at it,” Abdulraheem tells me through an interpreter. He is preparing the vegetables for fattoush, a staple salad of lettuce, tomato and crunchy pita chips. He stacks long leaves of romaine lettuce, one on top of the other, slicing them crosswise into small confetti ribbons as he talks, before perfectly dicing tomatoes. He cuts huge lemons in half, just once, and squeezes the juice out of them effortlessly. It’s a simple dish but one he loves to make, because it’s both universal and endlessly customizable. “I’m making fattoush, my wife will make fattoush, you can make fattoush,” he says. “But each time it will come out a little bit different, because it’s a reflection of you.”

When Abdulraheem arrived here in 2016, he became part of a long history of immigrants — often refugees — who reached the United States and began making food. You can find this tradition in Eden Center, the Northern Virginia strip mall packed with pho restaurants and pan-Asian groceries, built up by Vietnamese refugees in the 1980s. You can see it in the popular Ethiopian restaurants on U Street; in the restaurants of Peter Chang, who fled Washington’s Chinese Embassy in 2003 and acquired one of the most loyal followings of any chef in America; or in the Thai and Indian restaurants in large cities and small towns across the country.

Compared with these other cuisines, Syrian food doesn’t have as strong a footprint in the United States. Americans are familiar with Middle Eastern food generally, but while there’s certainly overlap between Syrian food and other Levantine cuisines, they are far from identical. The flavors that distinguish Syrian cuisine, according to Dimah Mohd, a Syrian food blogger based in Dubai, include rose water, orange blossom water, pomegranate molasses and Aleppo pepper. Garlic, eggplant, lamb, parsley and mint dominate, too. On the whole, the food is milder than some of the spicier dishes popular in other parts of the region, with more stews made of creamy yogurt sauce. Kibbe — croquettes made of bulgur, ground meat and other spices that vary from cook to cook, based on style, family and region — are common, too. Hummus and shawarma, familiar to Americans, are staples of the cuisine; but so are makdous, tiny preserved eggplants stuffed with walnut and red pepper, and fatteh, a flatbread, yogurt and chickpea dish.

“It is a very rich cuisine, with noticeable regional differences, as well as the combination of sweet and sour flavors, with meat cooked with fruit or in fruit juice,” says Anissa Helou, a part-Syrian, part-Lebanese author who has written several cookbooks about the region’s food, including “Levant: Recipes and Memories From the Middle East.” Helou says that lumping together all the cuisines of the region can gloss over the wide varieties of deliciousness to be found there. “It is a shame, really,” she says, “because no one talks of European cuisine, for instance.”

What Abdulraheem and other refugee chefs bring when they come to America has implications beyond the kitchen. Cooking the dishes — sharing the foods of their home country — is a way of ensuring “that identity and heritage are not lost just because the homeland is,” says Poopa Dweck, author of the book “Aromas of Aleppo: The Legendary Cuisine of Syrian Jews.” They are “documenting history, in some way, for the next generation.”

It’s this diversity — the richness of so many cuisines and cultures, brought from all over the world — that makes American food so outstanding. At the moment, however, that tradition is under threat. The Trump administration has dedicated a lot of energy to barring Syrian refugees like Abdulraheem from coming into the country, while waging a multifront campaign against undocumented immigrants from Latin America. Continuing on this path would have a profound impact — not just on our food, but on our national identity.

It can be hard to explain to people who view immigration as a threat just what we stand to lose when we turn away from this ideal. Maybe a grand argument about American values isn’t the best place to begin. Maybe it’s best to start smaller, somewhere closer to home — somewhere like the dinner table.

There are things that Majed Abdulraheem doesn’t usually talk about when he’s at work chopping vegetables. But they’re on his mind a lot: How, on his last visit to his parents’ home in 2013, they begged him not to return to his apartment in Damascus but to flee Syria across the border to Jordan instead. How he did as his parents asked. And how he never got to see his father, who became ill during his exile, before he died.

Abdulraheem was working at a Damascus restaurant in 2011 when the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad started. Back then, he didn’t want to choose a side. But in the months that followed, it became unavoidable. Government checkpoints sprang up on the road between Damascus and his parents’ home. Rebels armed with guns started showing up in the streets. “Society as a whole started to divide,” he says. The checkpoints only seemed to make the roads less safe. It quickly became clear that it didn’t matter to the security forces whether you were a rebel fighter or a civilian. “The regime didn’t distinguish between the people who were involved or not,” he says. “A plane would come by and drop a bomb and just kill everyone.”

By the end of 2012, he says, “it got to the point where I didn’t even want to leave my house.” Each trip to the market — to pick up a bag of tomatoes, to buy a can of Pepsi — became an intolerably dangerous proposition. Every time he went out, he worried that he might not make it back home.

Then, one night in early 2013, he was at his parents’ home when they made a difficult request. “My mother began crying and begged me not to return to Damascus, but to leave for Jordan instead,” he says. “To this day, I still remember my mother and father, when I stayed with them, they wouldn’t sleep. They watched me all night. I could feel them watching over me until I got up in the morning. They were so upset for my safety.” Two days later, Abdulraheem took the small suitcase he’d packed for a short stay and got on a bus heading toward the border, leaving the rest of his belongings behind.

He crossed the border in total darkness, trying not to stumble on rocks or run into trees. It was a bracingly cold February night. No one dared use any light — not a flashlight, not a lit match, not a cellphone — for fear that the regime might spot them crossing and try to bomb them. The place where he crossed was desolate and mountainous. Most of the people crossing with him were women and children. “The whole night, people were crying,” he says. “To this day, I still hear it. I can’t get it out of my head.”

On the other side of the border in Jordan, a police officer was waiting to receive them. Abdulraheem was transferred to the Zaatari refugee camp but moved to Amman, the capital, shortly after. There, he reconnected with his fiancee, Walaa, and they got married. In 2016, they found out that their application to come to the United States had been approved, and they moved with their two young daughters, Rama and Lara, to Tucson, where they were relocated with the help of a refugee agency.

In Arizona, Abdulraheem went to work in a Tex-Mex restaurant, the B Line. The food was a little spicier than he was used to. Over time, though, he grew to love the food, and he bonded with the co-workers who taught him to cook it. After eight months, Majed, Walaa, Lara and Rama moved to a small apartment in Riverdale Park, Md., a D.C. suburb, to be closer to family. Once here, he got a job working with Foodhini and has worked there full time ever since. Someday, though, he dreams of striking out on his own.

Forty miles northeast of Union Kitchen, in the working-class Baltimore suburb of Dundalk, I met Rajaa Abbas, 43, and Salwa Al Hasrieh, 39, two Syrian refugees who recently came to the United States after living in Jordan. The pair quickly became friends after Hasrieh’s arrival in fall 2016. Abbas and Hasrieh are part of a Baltimore-based catering collective known as Aleppo Kitchen. The group, which is made up of about 20 Syrian refugee women, was initially conceived of by Laila El Haddad, a Palestinian writer and co-author of the cookbook “The Gaza Kitchen: A Palestinian Culinary Journey.” The Muslim Social Services Agency, a Baltimore-based charitable organization, helps support the group, as does BRIDGE America — a local organization Haddad’s husband and other members of Maryland’s Muslim community put together to assist refugees as they settle into life in the United States.

“It started with a few women we knew. We asked, ‘Who do you know?’ ” Haddad says. More women in the community were arriving and were looking for ways to earn income. Haddad set them up with a WhatsApp group chat and began taking catering requests for them. “Up until now, it’s been all volunteer-run and focused on creating income for the women,” she says. “Beyond the financial element of it, what I’ve learned from observing it is that it’s very emotionally healing, even though we’re not yet meeting in a physical space.” The catering gigs are inconsistent, she says, but the collective usually gets several jobs each month.

Abbas’s kitchen, in the back of a low-slung rowhouse, is spacious but simple, with just a stovetop and a bit of counter space on either side of the sink. There are parts of the kitchen she hasn’t warmed to; at one point, laughing, she opens her dishwasher, revealing that it’s stuffed with Fanta bottles and plastic bags, temporary storage for her recycling. But she’s starting to make it feel more like a home. In her tiny fenced-in square of a back yard, she has dug a small trench around the perimeter, and in 10 months the soil has already yielded okra, green beans, parsley, mint and tomatoes.

On the day I visit, they cook a feast of chicken for me. Abbas rinses a large bowl of freekeh, a popular Levantine grain, sifting it with her hands. As she cuts an onion into a pot, Hasrieh rolls cooked chicken in a sauce made of tomato paste, yogurt, cardamom, cinnamon and ginger. The two tell me about their lives back home in Syria, as Haddad translates.

In Damascus, Abbas explains, she was a hairdresser, but she had always loved to cook; before she met her husband, her mother-in-law identified her as a potential match for her son because she brought so many good dishes to share with her on a pilgrimage. “We can help our families earn income,” she says of her and Hasrieh’s cooking for Aleppo Kitchen. “For me, it was a very natural thing to do, to cook.”

On the table in front of her, she puts a platter of lemony yalanji, grape leaves rolled the thickness of cigars and stuffed with tender rice and herbs, and the platter of spiced chicken on a bed of freekeh, cooked in cardamom, ginger, ghee and cinnamon, studded with almonds and topped with bright slices of pepper. Beside it is a large bowl of salatit khyar bi laban, a cool homemade yogurt dish mixed with diced cucumber, garlic and mint; a salad; and preserved eggplants stuffed with sweet pepper and walnut. Abbas says her reasons for coming to America were really about giving her kids a better life. But now that she’s here, and now that she’s had a chance to earn money with her cooking, she’d love to open a restaurant of her own someday.

In July, I attend a fundraising event catered by the women of Aleppo Kitchen, for the Global Center for Refugee Education and Science, a local nonprofit that aims to provide language training for refugees new to the United States. The fundraiser, on the second floor of the Saloon, a pub on U Street NW, is sold out. In the middle of the room, beneath strands of hanging lights, guests hover around platters of Syrian kabsa, chicken cooked in tomatoes, peppers, cloves, onion and cinnamon on rice; fattet al-makdous, flatbread topped with tomato-yogurt sauce and eggplants stuffed with meat; kunafa, a crispy, cheesy textured pastry, soaked in sweet syrup; and mamounia, a semolina pudding.

At the event, I speak to Rashid Al-Banna, who works with the Muslim Social Services Agency. He thinks there’s a market for more Syrian food in the region. Plus, he says, the women’s cooking is part of a larger mission: “Basically, what we’re trying to do with food is use it as a vehicle for people-to-people, culture-to-culture exchange. Food is like music or sports or the arts — it’s a great way to bond people, to bring them together. It’s universal.”

Sitting on couches in their small living room, Majed Abdulraheem and his wife, Walaa, describe to me the restaurant they hope to open together. “As we think of it, the main character of the cafe would be Syrian,” Walaa says. “There might be add-ons that Majed would throw in — American or Mexican, perhaps — but primarily it would be a Syrian cafe.” As we speak, their daughters ride tricycles and run in and out of the room, stopping occasionally to dive into their mother’s arms. Behind her, on their dining room table, sit platters of shawarma, fattoush and kibbe that they prepared for the visit.

“That’s my dream,” Majed says. “Actually, I wouldn’t really call it a dream. It’s something I plan on doing in the future.” He says he would like to someday travel, to learn from restaurateurs in other countries. But it’s hard to imagine leaving the United States right now, given the current administration’s hostility toward letting refugees in.

In opening a restaurant, Majed would be following in the footsteps of countless immigrants to America. Among them is Seng Luangrath, owner of Thip Khao, the first all-Lao restaurant in the District. When she was a girl, Luangrath’s favorite thing to do was cook with her grandmother in their kitchen. She’d been raised by her grandmother in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, while her mother worked and her father helped the U.S.-allied Royal Lao Army.

After the Communist takeover of Laos, her dad was taken into custody, and — just as Abdulraheem’s parents had done for him — Luangrath’s grandmother pulled her mother aside one day and told her it was time to flee the country. One child was expected to stay behind and take care of her elders. “Why not me? I can stay in the kitchen and help you,” she remembers telling her grandma. But it didn’t work: Luangrath’s grandmother chose her sister, who was more fearless than Luangrath.

Her mother and grandmother hired coyotes and told Seng and her brothers to pack their bags. They took a bus to the border, telling anyone who asked that they were taking a vacation to visit her father’s family in the country. Seng was terrified. She was 12 years old.

At the border, they temporarily separated her and her mother from her two brothers and told them to wait until late into the night. At 3 in the morning, the coyotes came. She and her mother and brothers were taken to the Mekong River. They crossed partly by boat, and when it got shallow enough, waded the rest of the way across. The water came up to their chests. As they neared the Thai side of the river, they heard gunshots firing behind them.

Once they made it to Thailand, the family was taken to a refugee camp. There, Luangrath continued learning how to cook. The camp had simple bamboo huts, with open sides, so she made her neighbors into her instructors and the camp into a sort of culinary school — watching through the sides of the hut, asking what they were making and if she could help. Her mother met a man who would eventually become her stepfather. He was a great cook, so she learned everything she could from him, too.

In the camp, they were provided a few staples, like steamed fish and Chinese sausage, so Seng took the produce to the entrance checkpoint and traded her items with the local Thai residents. “I learned so much about different styles of cooking,” she says of her time there. After two years in the camps and some time in the Philippines, Luangrath and her family were approved to come to the United States. They settled in the San Francisco Bay area, where Seng and her brothers were thrust into school with no English skills. Her mother and stepfather worked multiple jobs, and Seng became something like a second mother for the family.

“Every day, I would come home from school, do my homework and then start cooking dinner,” she recalls. In America, her cooking teachers were the chefs she watched on television. “I learned a lot from PBS,” she says. She watched Julia Child, Jacques Pépin and Martin Yan of “Yan Can Cook.” She remembers being fascinated by Child’s use of the oven — not common to Lao cuisine — and trying her first stir-fry, experimenting with different oils she could use, learning about cornstarch. On Saturdays, her mother would take her to do the grocery shopping in Chinatown, exposing her to a diverse array of new ingredients to try in the next week’s meals.

Even though she loved cooking, she would spend nearly 30 years in the United States before she got to open a restaurant of her own. Opening a restaurant in Washington is a big financial risk; the costs of rent and labor are too high for most people. But after years of working in her family’s flooring and construction businesses, Luangrath got her chance in 2010, when she was introduced to a woman who wanted to sell her Thai restaurant, Bangkok Golden in Virginia.

At first, it was difficult — Luangrath remembers having to close the first day midway through the afternoon because she was too overwhelmed trying to keep the place running — but once she figured out what she was doing, she got more confident. She began offering a few of her favorite Lao dishes on a separate menu. It attracted a small following. A few months later, The Washington Post’s food critic, Tom Sietsema, came and tried the food. He raved about Luangrath’s Lao offerings, and after that, she says, the interest in her cooking exploded.

Eventually, Luangrath opened Thip Khao, now one of the best- known Lao restaurants in the country, as well as one of the buzziest: Last year, it was recognized by Michelin, in its first guide to dining in the nation’s capital, as one of the city’s places to have a delicious meal for under $40. In 2015, Bon Appétit named it one of America’s best new restaurants.

Being a refugee shaped every aspect of Luangrath’s culinary development. When Laotian people visit her packed restaurant, they often tell her they’re confused; she’s from Vientiane, which is in the center of the country, but she cooks some dishes like a southerner, and plenty of her menu items have personal touches they haven’t seen before. The dishes show a distinctiveness that only she could have come up with: a textured, crispy rice dish, inspired by one she used to buy as a kid; softened tofu wrapped in banana leaves and baked with dill and lemon grass, the result of experimenting with vegetarian ways of making a common Lao dish. “If I’d never fled the country, I probably wouldn’t get as much of the different styles,” she says.

A restaurant rooted in one’s own life experiences — that’s what Majed dreams of for himself someday. “I want something unique, that offers distinctive dishes,” he says. “Done the way I would do it.”

The culinary education of refugee chefs is unusual. It is at once cosmopolitan — thanks to the fusing of different influences during the chef’s travels — and narrowly defined by both physical barriers and the limitations of circumstance. The journeys of refugee chefs often spark creativity, born of necessity. The education, just like the migration, is sui generis. Just like America.

"Joby Warrick, Joby Warrick",North Korea was once regarded as too backward to make biological weapons. No longer.,2017-12-10T11:38:00Z,the-washington-post,Microbes by the ton: Officials see weapons threat as North Korea gains biotech expertise,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/microbes-by-the-ton-officials-see-weapons-threat-as-north-korea-gains-biotech-expertise/2017/12/10/9b9d5f9e-d5f0-11e7-95bf-df7c19270879_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/12/02/National-Security/Images/2017-11-30T104424Z_1035672254_RC16A3CD26A0_RTRMADP_3_NORTHKOREA-KIMJONGUN-INSIGHT.jpg?t=20170517,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Five months before North Korea’s first nuclear test in 2006, U.S. intelligence officials sent a report to Congress warning that secret work also was underway on a biological weapon. The communist regime, which had long ago acquired the pathogens that cause smallpox and anthrax, had assembled teams of scientists but seemed to be lacking in certain technical skills, the report said.

“Pyongyang’s resources presently include a rudimentary biotechnology infrastructure,” the report by the director of national intelligence explained.

A decade later, the technical hurdles appear to be falling away. North Korea is moving steadily to acquire the essential machinery that could potentially be used for an advanced bioweapons program, from factories that can produce microbes by the ton, to laboratories specializing in genetic modification, according to U.S. and Asian intelligence officials and weapons experts.

Meanwhile, leader Kim Jong Un’s government also is dispatching its scientists abroad to seek advanced degrees in microbiology, while offering to sell biotechnology services to the developing world.

The gains have alarmed U.S. analysts, who say North Korea — which has doggedly pursued weapons of mass destruction of every other variety — could quickly surge into industrial-scale production of biological pathogens if it chooses to do so. Such a move could give the regime yet another fearsome weapon with which to threaten neighbors or U.S. troops in a future conflict, officials and analysts say.

Current and former U.S. officials with access to classified files say they have seen no hard evidence so far that Kim has ordered production of actual weapons, beyond samples and prototypes. And they can only speculate about the reasons.

“That the North Koreans have [biological] agents is known, by various means,” said one senior U.S. official familiar with military preparations for a biological attack. The official, like several others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity regarding sensitive military assessments. “The lingering question is, why have they acquired the materials and developed the science, but not yet produced weapons?”

[This North Korea ship was carrying illegal weapons — and a surprise]

But the official, like others interviewed, also acknowledged that spy agencies might not detect a change in North Korea’s program, since the new capabilities are embedded within civilian factories ostensibly engaged in making agricultural and pharmaceutical products.

“If it started tomorrow we might not know it,” the official said, “unless we’re lucky enough to have an informant who happens to be in just the right place.”

Germ factory

In a country that is famously secretive, it is perhaps the most carefully guarded secret of all. North Korea consistently denies having a biological warfare program of any kind, and it has worked diligently to keep all evidence of weapons research hidden from sight.

Yet, in 2015, the country’s leader took it upon himself to partially roll back the curtain. On June 6 of that year, Kim commandeered a crew of North Korean cameramen for a visit to the newly named Pyongyang Biotechnical Institute, a sprawling, two-story facility on the grounds of what used to a vitamin factory.

State-run news media described the institute as a factory for making biological pesticides — mainly, live bacteria that can kill the worms and caterpillars that threaten North Korea’s cabbage crop. But to U.S. analysts studying the video, the images provided an unexpected jolt: On display inside the military-run facility were rooms jammed with expensive equipment, including industrial-scale fermenters used for growing bulk quantities of live microbes, and large dryers designed to turn billions of bacterial spores into a fine powder for easy dispersal.

Many of the machines were banned from sale to North Korea under international sanctions because of their possible use in a bioweapons program. But Kim, wearing a white lab coat and trailed by a phalanx of scientists and military officers, appeared almost gleeful in showing them off, striking the same rapt pose as when he visits the country’s installations for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.

[Assassination sheds light on North Korea’s chemical arsenal]

It was the first public confirmation of the existence of such machines in North Korea, and some U.S. and Asian experts saw their presence as deeply ominous.

“It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the institute is intended to produce military-size batches of anthrax,” Melissa Hanham, a North Korea specialist at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif., wrote in a blog post after the video was shown. “Regardless of whether the equipment is being used to produce anthrax today, it could be in the near future.”

U.S. analysts now believe the timing of the visit was deliberate: The previous week, on May 28, the Pentagon had publicly acknowledged that live samples of U.S.-made anthrax bacteria had been accidentally shipped to a South Korean military base because of a lab mix-up. North Korea lodged a formal complaint with the United Nations on June 4, calling the incident proof of American “biological warfare schemes” against its citizens.

Kim’s trip to the biotechnology institute came just two days later, and was clearly intended to send a message, Hanham said in an interview.

“Responding by showing their own capability could be taken as a threat,” she said.

Some weapons experts were skeptical, noting the absence of biohazard suits and protective gear typically found in laboratories that work with deadly pathogens. But since the release of the images, subsequent examinations have poked holes in the official story about the factory’s purpose. For one thing, some of the machines shown in the video were not visibly connected to any pipes, vents or ductwork. Experts also have questioned why North Korea would buy expensive industrial equipment at black-market rates, just to make a pesticide that can be purchased legally, at vastly cheaper rates, from China.

“The real takeaway is that [North Korea] had the dual-use equipment necessary for bioweapons production,” said Andrew C. Weber, a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs. “What the photos show is a modern bio-production capability.”

Waiting for orders

That North Korea possesses the basic components for biological weapons is all but settled doctrine within U.S. and Asian military and intelligence establishments, and has been for years.

Although overshadowed by Pyongyang’s nuclear and chemical weapons, the threat of biological attack from the North is regarded as sufficiently serious that the Pentagon routinely vaccinates all Korea-bound troops for exposure to anthrax and smallpox.

“It’s a presumption that they have it and will use it,” said a retired military officer who oversaw troops on the peninsula. “We’ve had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to deal with some of the WMD.”

But determining North Korea’s precise capabilities — and the regime’s intentions for using such weapons — has been among the toughest intelligence challenges for U.S. analysts. Official assessments by U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies have generally concluded that Pyongyang has experimented with a handful of bacterial strains, including the microbes that cause anthrax, cholera and plague. U.S. analysts also have believed since at least the mid-1990s that North Korea possesses the smallpox virus, a conclusion based in part on the discovery of antibodies in the bloodstreams of North Korean soldiers who escaped to the South in the 1980s and 1990s.

[Amazing video show’s North Korean soldier’s flight across border]

That assessment, while controversial, is buttressed by senior North Korean government and military defectors as well as foreign governments with special insight into the regime’s military secrets. In 1993, the head of the Russian intelligence agency’s foreign branch revealed in a report that North Korea was performing “applied military-biological research” on four pathogens, including microbes that cause anthrax and smallpox.

But more recently, questions about North Korea’s capability have taken on a new urgency, as military planners prepare for the possibility that tensions with Pyongyang could lead to war. While U.S. and South Korean aircraft would seek to knock out suspected chemical and biological facilities from the air, the newest plans include a presumption that infantry divisions would have to face an array of chemical and biological hazards on the battlefield — hazards that may be invisible to fast-moving ground troops, current and former U.S. officials say.

But germs as military weapons also have distinct disadvantages, as they are difficult to control and can take hours or days to kill or disable. A consensus view among military planners is that Kim is choosing to hold his bioweapons card in reserve for now, while his scientists build up a capacity to manufacture large quantities of pathogens quickly. Now that the North is equipped with state-of-the-art factories and teams of trained specialists, that shift could conceivably happen in weeks or even days, the senior official said.

“The capabilities — the science and technology — all of that now exists,” the official said. “Kim has chosen not to deploy at this time. But ultimately it comes down to a political decision.”

Unlocking DNA secrets

In the waning years of the Cold War, Soviet weapons scientists labored in secret to build new super-germs more dangerous than those found in nature. With mixed success, using techniques still novel in the 1980s, they spliced together bits of DNA to increase virulence — so that microbes would kill more quickly — or to introduce stealthy features that would make them harder to detect.

There is no known evidence that Pyongyang is working to engineer designer bugs, U.S. analysts say. But there are signs that North Korea is attempting to catapult itself into the 21st-century worlds of genetic research and biomedical science.

In 2015, as North Korea’s new microbe-producing factory was coming online, North Korean scientists were teaming up with Chinese counterparts on a research project to identify previously unknown bacterial species discovered in the glacial ice in Svalbard, the Norway-owned island chain far north of the Arctic Circle. In a rare instance in which North Koreans took the lead on a peer-reviewed scientific paper, the scientists described using DNA sequencing techniques to isolate the novel strains.

The project was the most dramatic example of what private researchers describe as a surge of interest by North Koreans in genetic engineering and other biotech disciplines. Earlier this year, the Welsh artificial intelligence firm Amplyfi conducted a search of the “deep Web” — the parts of the Internet invisible to the public — for evidence of North Korean interest in biodefense topics. The company’s DataVoyant search tool produced hundreds of thousands of hits and showed a spike in interest in such terms as “gene expression” and “nucleic acid sequence,” beginning two years ago.

A preliminary analysis suggested a pattern of behavior that U.S. and Asian officials have independently confirmed: a broad North Korean effort to obtain outside expertise from private companies, academic institutions and even nonprofits, company officials said. North Korea is believed to have used technical designs from a British agricultural nonprofit in building its microbe-producing Pyongyang Biotechnology Center, and it has sought to enroll promising microbiology students in top research universities across Europe and Asia. In recent years, the North Koreans also have sought to sell medical services to the developing world, in one instance building and staffing an entire hospital in Zambia.

“Every continent is represented,” Amplyfi co-founder Chris Ganje said in a phone interview from the company’s headquarters in Cardiff, Wales. He said the search turned up “worrying indicators of unintended support,” adding: “It is obvious that the international community and larger institutions need to be cautious in providing seemingly benign academic scientific education and training to North Korea.”

A harder challenge is separating legitimate efforts to improve North Korea’s medical infrastructure with more sinister attempts to a create new varieties of killing machines, officials and experts acknowledge. Joseph DeTrani, a retired CIA veteran who oversaw intelligence collection for North Korea in the 2000s, noted that ambiguity has been a built-in feature of North Korean weapons programs for decades.

“They talk openly about their ‘nuclear deterrent,’ but with chemical and biological weapons, it’s different,” DeTrani said. “They’ve always played it close to the vest. For them, it’s a real option. But they want to preserve the possibility of deniability.”","militarybiological

In his own statements, Trump said the move merely recognized the “reality” of where Israel already operates its government. Senior administration officials insisted that the decision was meaningless in the context of hoped-for Middle East peace negotiations and emphasized that most issues disputed between Israel and the Palestinians remained on the table.

None suggested a concrete U.S. national security objective that was furthered by the move, or indicated that it was part of a strategy for achieving the peace deal that Trump has said is a primary foreign policy goal. Instead, a decision on which players in the region said they were not consulted, and many of his own senior aides advised against, fulfilled a campaign promise and buttressed a reputation for unconventional thinking that Trump clearly sees as an asset.

[Trump had for months been determined to move U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem]

In a briefing Friday for reporters, David Satterfield, the acting assistant secretary of state for the region, largely avoided the “why” question, except to restate Trump’s “reality” formulation and note repeatedly that the president had acted on what he “believes.”

Near the end of his first year as leader of the free world, Trump clearly believes that on this, and on other major international issues facing the United States, he is doing an excellent job.

In remarks after his lengthy trip to Asia last month, Trump spoke of “this great American comeback” and declared that “America’s standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now.”

Trump clearly has his fans, among them Israel’s government and European populists who have cheered his uncompromising stands against immigrants. Some Arab and Asian governments, and Trump supporters in Congress, have applauded what they see as his tough, uncompromising stands against North Korea and Iran, although his strategy for dealing with them remains unclear.

The president has correctly noted that NATO is glad he made an issue of member failure to meet defense spending targets, propelling some to spend more, faster.

But he has few real admirers among alliance leaders, whom he has alienated on issues ranging from his jettisoning of painstakingly negotiated climate and trade agreements, his reluctance to champion the alliance’s mutual defense pact, and his disdain for the Iran nuclear deal.

[Trump policies starting to ‘crumble’ traditional U.S.-Europe ties, German foreign minister warns]

In public remarks last week, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel spoke for many Western European allies when he said that, far from boosting its leadership role, the United States has withdrawn from the international stage and now sees the world “as a fighting community where everyone has to seek their own advantage.”

After Trump, Gabriel said, his country’s relations with America “will never be the same.”

At home, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) on Friday bemoaned U.S. relinquishment of its position as the world’s standard-bearer for human rights. In a letter to Trump, they noted he had never even mentioned the issue publicly while visiting repressive regimes in Asia.

Trump’s reluctance to criticize Russia — whether tied to the ongoing investigation of what U.S. intelligence has said were Moscow’s efforts to get him elected, or his oft-repeated belief that close U.S.-Russia relations are good for the United States — has made many lawmakers uncomfortable. Many of his strongest supporters in Congress were part of an overwhelming vote last summer to impose new sanctions against Russia, despite the president’s strong objections.

[Trump says Putin sincere in denial of Russian meddling]

To the extent the United States has left a void, others are stepping in. As Russia has expanded its influence in the Middle East, China’s role is growing in Africa and Latin America, and it is soon expected to match or overtake the United States in many aspects of global leadership. As a hefty U.S. trade deficit has grown significantly under Trump, President Xi Jinping has said China is poised to give developing countries a “new choice” as his country takes “center stage” in the world.

Even longtime Arab partners in the Middle East have voiced outrage over the Jerusalem decision, with many saying the United States can no longer claim the leading role in bringing the Israelis and Palestinians to a negotiated peace.

Asked whether the Jerusalem decision would impede achievement of the “ultimate deal” Trump has said he wants to forge there, Satterfield responded, “I can’t make that judgment at this point.”

Others were more certain. “We don’t see this as a good idea in any way possible,” said a senior official in the government of a close U.S. ally in the Middle East, speaking on the condition of anonymity to analyze Trump’s motivation. “That’s why we say this is something that had support within the U.S. political establishment. We look at it as a domestic-driven position more than anything else,” because “it doesn’t make any sense on the peace-process level.”

What Trump’s decision did accomplish was checking off a campaign promise to two important constituencies — wealthy conservative Jewish contributors, and motivated white evangelicals who voted for him despite his moral failings and a lack of real connection to that community.

To some foreign policy experts, campaign positions that Trump believes got him elected — and expects will do the same next time around — are the basis for many of his major foreign policy initiatives.

“Mr. Trump’s foreign policies serve his political purposes, not the nation’s interests,” Robert B. Zoellick, a former World Bank president and senior official in the George W. Bush administration, wrote late last month in the Wall Street Journal. Trump’s populism, Zoellick wrote, looks for enemies and “feed[s] off grievances and impatience with traditional politics.”

In a piece in the Wall Street Journal the next day, Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead took a different view. Trump, he said, is responding to the exhaustion and unwieldiness of the “gassy globalism” that has been America’s post-World War II leadership strategy. This “vast, misshapen edifice,” in which the United States claims leadership on virtually every international issue, he said, was unsustainable.

Jon B. Alterman, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, posited a third rationale. Trump’s foreign policy, he said in an interview, “is instinctual and not rational” and is rooted in “his delight in defying conventional wisdom.”

Decisions like the Jerusalem recognition, Alterman said, are “not for strategic purposes, but for matters of personal style and instinct,” even as they may disrupt the administration’s own diplomatic initiatives. “I think he has interpreted the last three years,” since he first contemplated a presidential run, “as reinforcing the idea that he is both unusually gifted, and rewarded, because he is unconventional,” Alterman said.

“All of that may well be true,” said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and author, with James Lindsay, of a forthcoming book titled “How America Abdicated its Global Leadership Role.”

“But what convinces me is that he’s had a particular view on how America engages with the world,” dating back many years, Daalder said, recalling a full-page New York Times ad Trump purchased in 1987 to charge that America was being “laughed at” for giving others a free ride at its expense.

As the post-World War II war United States has carried the burden of multilateral leadership, “we have not been a normal country when it comes to engagement in the world,” Daalder said.

“If we’re going to be a normal country,” he said, the United States will have to become accustomed to “being on the losing side” of international issues “more often than we’re used to being.”

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Dec. 10 said that the women who have accused President Trump of sexual misconduct “should be heard.” (Reuters)

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday that the women who have accused President Trump of touching or groping them without their consent “should be heard.”

Haley’s comments, made on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” diverged from the White House position on the more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of misconduct. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said that the White House’s position is that the women are lying and that the American people settled the issue by electing Trump despite the accusations.

[President Trump and accusations of sexual misconduct: The complete list]

Asked by CBS’s John Dickerson whether she considered the allegations a “settled issue,” given last year’s election results, Haley responded, “You know, that’s for the people to decide. I know that he was elected. But, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.”

Haley’s comments highlighted a challenge facing Republicans as a cultural revolution on the topic of sexual harassment sweeps the country.

Republicans have seized on allegations of wrongdoing by Democrats, including Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who announced they would resign last week.

Republicans also have castigated liberals over high-profile allegations against figures in Hollywood and the media, including movie producer Harvey Weinstein, a Hillary Clinton donor and ally.

But most have not shown similar outrage when allegations have been made against prominent Republicans, notably Trump and Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama.

Haley spoke about Trump’s accusers after praising women who have come forward with allegations about powerful men in various other industries. Dickerson asked her how “people should assess the accusers of the president.”

“They should be heard, and they should be dealt with,” Haley responded. “And I think we heard from them before the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.”

Trump has been sued for defamation in New York by one of his accusers, Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice” who says Trump groped and kissed her in a hotel room in 2007 during a meeting to discuss a job opportunity. She says Trump defamed her when he dismissed her account and called her and the other accusers liars. A judge is weighing whether to allow that case to proceed.

Haley’s comments came in contrast to other Republicans, who have defended Trump, noting that the public elected Trump president even knowing about allegations from multiple women against him.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said that “to re-litigate the election is impossible.”

“The allegations or the accusations against the president were a part of the campaign,” Scott said. “Should people who were victimized have their day in court, their opportunity to present their information? I have no problem with that issue.”

Democrats have continued to press the subject, with some beginning to argue Trump should resign his office like others have in face of such allegations.

“Al Franken felt it proper for him to resign,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in an interview with “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning. “Here you have a president who has been accused by many women of assault, who says on a tape that he assaulted women. He might want to think about doing the same.”

Sanders’s comment, which built on a tweet he had sent last week, came after Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said that the “#MeToo moment” should prompt another look at the women who accused Trump of sexual harassment during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“The president should resign because he certainly has a track record with more than 17 women of horrific conduct,” Merkley said last week in an interview for the weekday version of “Meet the Press.”

On Saturday, during a campaign swing to support the Democrat in Alabama’s U.S. Senate race, Booker told Vice News that the standard that brought down Franken should be applied to the president.

“I just watched Senator Al Franken do the honorable thing and resign from his office,” Booker said. “My question is, why isn’t Donald Trump doing the same thing — who has more serious allegations against him, with more women who have come forward. The fact pattern on him is far more damning than the fact pattern on Al Franken.”","united nations nikki haley

Monster fires in Southern California raged for a seventh day on Sunday, edging into Santa Barbara County while leaving residents of neighboring Ventura County to deal with the aftermath of a historic inferno.

As hundreds fled for safety in Santa Barbara County as the fires spread north, residents in Ventura County sifted through the rubble of what was once their homes. Thousands of other evacuees remained unable to return to their neighborhoods, leaving them to wonder what became of them.

Despite the widespread loss and uncertainty, residents and officials expressed relief and solidarity Sunday, with many saying the devastating fires have helped underscore what is most important in life.

“Everyone has been — to even say ‘amazing,’ that doesn’t even — the words cannot even come to mind about what to say about the gratitude that we have,” said Tracee Bird, who lost her home. “This is the feeling that’s all over Ventura right now, is this whole thing of people coming together.”

The Ventura Police Department on Sunday shuttled people to their homes and allowed them just 45 minutes to retrieve belongings before taking them back to the starting point in the parking lot of Temple Beth Torah in Ventura. Some complained that it has been difficult to get information about the status of their homes and how long they’ll be in temporary housing.

“Everything is hearsay because one person will tell you one thing, and another will tell you another,” said Rita Horn, while riding with a vanload of people after filling some bags with clothing. “I just don’t know what to believe.”

As of Sunday afternoon, Cal Fire couldn’t estimate when people might be able to start moving back.

“As long as the areas are a continued threat, we are going to leave those evacuation orders in place, for safety of life,” said Charles Esseling, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. “We understand people are antsy and want to get back in there, but we don’t want any issues or injuries.”

The Thomas Fire, in a coastal region northwest of Los Angeles, remained the largest active wildfire in the state, having burned through nearly 170,000 acres and taking with it more than 500 buildings and at least one life.

[Apocalyptic images show the devastation caused by raging Southern California fires]

Further north, residents of Santa Barbara County were facing the wrath of the advancing fire. About 85,000 households were without power, and authorities were ordering people in the beach communities of Carpinteria and Montecito to evacuate.

Over the weekend, National Weather Service meteorologist Rich Thompson warned Ventura residents at a town hall meeting that conditions are still combustible. Though the winds that have been stoking the fire are expected to ease up some during the week, he said, the air will remain warm and dry. He said next weekend could see another Santa Ana wind event, which could lead to the same dangerous conditions Southern California experienced last week.

“All the way through next week, there is going to be potential for elevated, even critical, fire conditions to continue across Ventura County,” he said.

In the Hidden Valley neighborhood, a hilly enclave in southeastern Ventura County, mask-wearing residents could be seen clutching bags of belongings during their 45-minute window to grab and go.

When Bill and Jan Coultas arrived at their home on Viewcrest Drive, they found an injured baby coyote in their front yard, singed from the flames.

“I tried to call animal control, but I never did get through to them,” said Bill Coultas, 71. “It just moved. It’s gone someplace else.”

Another neighbor, 27-year-old Kristal Santos, recently moved in with her cousin, Roxie Allen, after having been displaced by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.

“I’m like, really?” she said. “I have a friend who told me, ‘Don’t come here, you’ll bring an earthquake.’ ”

Tracee Bird’s home caught fire live on television. She and her husband Scott didn’t see it; they were on the freeway, trying to get out of town. But a friend called, and they raced back to see their burning house.

They pleaded with emergency workers to let them get close as the flames swallowed their home. Firefighters reluctantly allowed Tracee to capture the awful moment on video.

While watching her home burn down, a television news crew interviewed her. She lamented on camera that she hadn’t had time to salvage her Oakland Raiders jersey that bore No. 52 for her favorite player, Khalil Mack.

“That evening, I got a phone call from Khalil Mack, No. 52,” she said. “We chatted for 10 minutes; it totally put a smile on our faces.”

For a time, the Birds stayed at a hotel in Oxnard, south of Ventura. It so happened that Villanova Preparatory School, a Catholic boarding school in Ojai, had also evacuated to the hotel. The Birds and the students and staff ate KFC together. When the head master learned the Birds hadn’t had time to pack a change of clothes, she removed her Villanova jacket on the spot and handed it to Tracee, then went to her room and returned with more clothes.

“The love is just coming and coming and coming,” said Tracee Bird, 48. “It shows the most amazing side of the human spirit that we have.”

In Santa Paula, close to the origins of the Thomas Fire, author Laurel Braitman’s family was coming to terms with the fact that their 50-acre ranch had burned down and that the house Braitman’s parents built in 1979 was gone — except for the fireplace, the fireplace tools and, almost as a taunt, an untouched stack of firewood.

Braitman lives in the Bay Area and drove down after a friend called about the fire in Aliso Canyon in Santa Paula. She got there by 8 a.m. Tuesday, tuning into the scanner to track the path of the flames.

“It was wind like I’ve never seen before in my life,” she said. “It was moving through the canyons sequentially, and you could hear them calling everyone to the hills of Ventura. In the past, we’ve lived through fires two times, and we were never in danger of losing the house.”

Her mother and stepfather, both 70, grabbed garden hoses to fight the flames, unsuccessfully. They did manage to save her brother’s house.

In the city of Santa Barbara, residents continued to deal with heavy smoke and prepared for what might lie ahead.

“They say there’s asbestos and god knows what else in the ashes that are coming down,” said Muriel Ridland, 87.

Ridland was one of dozens of local residents who came in the early afternoon to get free masks distributed jointly through Direct Relief and the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department at the Santa Barbara Public Library. Molly Watta, 33, a senior librarian at the library, estimated they would distribute all 6,000 masks on Sunday.

“Santa Barbara is amazing,” Ridland said. “Little kids, teenagers, everybody is wearing the masks.”

Many must now decide if it’s finally time to leave their homes.

“We’ve been indoors since this started. We can’t do much,” said Jose Ramirez, 37, who has been staying home all week with his wife and children, ages 9 and 16. “My in-laws live in Oxnard. If they get the days off school, we might go to Oxnard. It’s raining ashes here.”

Richard Shelby Says He Couldn't Bring Himself to Vote for Roy Moore,http://time.com/5057803/richard-shelby-alabama-roy-moore/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/roy-moore-richard-shelby-alabama1.png,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said on Sunday that he could not bring himself to vote for Republican candidate Roy Moore in Alabama’s upcoming Senate election.

Shelby, a Republican, said he did not vote for the Democratic candidate Doug Jones, but had written in a “distinguished Republican candidate” who he did not name.

“I’d rather see a Republican win, but I hope that Republican will be a write in,” Shelby told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union. “I think a lot of people could do that. Will they do that? I’m not sure.”

“I couldn’t vote for Roy Moore,” he said. “The state of Alabama deserves better.”

Since Nov. 9, nine women have said Moore pursued them romantically, with many saying they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. The allegations included initiating sexual contact with a 14-year-old and serving an underage teenager wine. Moore has denied all the allegations, characterizing them as politically motivated and an attack from the liberal media.

Recent polling shows the race, which would typically be an easy win for a Republican candidate given Alabama’s history as a conservative state, is exceedingly close.

After the initial deluge of allegations, the Republican Party largely backed away from Moore, with several senators pulling their endorsements, and the Republican National Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee severing financial ties with the candidate. However, President Donald Trump endorsed Moore on Dec. 4, and has recorded a robocall for him.

After Trump’s endorsement, the Republican National Committee said it would financially support Moore, and transferred $170,000 to the Alabama GOP. The NRSC, however, is still staying out of the race; the organization’s chairman, Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, has said Moore should be expelled from the Senate if he wins. Shelby said that the Senate will have to determine Moore’s fitness for serving if he wins.

“I understand where the president’s coming from, I understand we would like to retain that seat in the U.S. Senate,” Shelby told Tapper. “But there’s a time, we call it a tipping point. And I think so many accusations, so many cuts, so many drip drip drip — when it got to the 14-year-old story, that was enough for me. I said, ‘I can’t vote for Roy Moore.'”","national republican senatorial committee

Associated Press,,2017-12-10T20:13:45Z,time,Nikki Haley: President Trump's Sexual Misconduct Accusers Should be Heard,http://time.com/5057890/nikki-haley-sexual-misconduct-trump/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/nikki-haley-sexual-misconduct.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"(WASHINGTON) — The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Sunday that women who accuse someone of sexual misconduct deserve to be heard, even if it involves President Donald Trump.

“I know that he was elected, but women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them,” Nikki Haley said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

Trump, a Republican, won the White House last year despite the election season release of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape in which he described grabbing women’s private parts, followed by accusations by several women of aggressive sexual misconduct. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has since reiterated the White House’s position that the women who accused Trump of sexual harassment are lying.

On Sunday, Haley, who was the first female governor of South Carolina, praised the courage of women who have raised complaints of harassment in various industries, including government and Hollywood, saying they will “bring a conscience to the situation.”

“Women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with, and I think we heard them prior to the election,” said Haley, a Republican. “I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.”

Asked whether Trump’s election settled the issue, Haley said it was “for the people to decide.”

The wave of allegations have brought down powerful figures, including the resignations last week of Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz.","nation” trump a republican

Beatrice Fihn Receives Nobel Peace Prize for Her Work to Ban Nuclear Weapons,http://time.com/5056523/beatrice-fihn-nobel-peace-prize/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/beatrice-fihn-nobel-peace-prize.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"When Beatrice Fihn received a call on Oct. 6 informing the 35-year-old Swede that her group, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, she suspected a possible prank. Not that you should blame her—ICAN is just 10 years old, and the group’s aims can seem positively fanciful: the complete elimination of the world’s roughly 15,000 nuclear warheads. But that call from the Norwegian Nobel Committee was real, and so is Fihn’s goal—which may be less quixotic than it seems.

ICAN, a global coalition of 440 partner organizations in 98 countries, was honored for its efforts to advance the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was successfully finalized by two-thirds of the United Nations’ 192 members this summer. The treaty—which would outlaw nuclear weapons’ use, production and possession—is now open for ratification, and will become international law after 50 countries sign on.

Those countries almost certainly won’t include the members of the nuclear club: The U.S., Russia, China, Great Britain, France, Pakistan, India and North Korea. (Israel is also widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, but the state has neither confirmed nor denied whether it does.) The nuclear-armed countries opposed the treaty, arguing that nuclear deterrence has helped keep peace between great states through the postwar era. “We have to be realistic,” as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley put it when treaty talks began in March.

But growing tensions with a nuclear-armed North Korea—as well as the uncomfortable fact that an often erratic President Trump now has his finger on the button—are enough to make even the most hardened Cold Warrior wonder about the wisdom of keeping a nuclear arsenal. Fihn is realistic that nuclear weapons won’t be abolished overnight. But just as earlier treaties banning biological weapons and land mines eventually led to such munitions being phased out, she believes a nuclear arms ban could help turn the public against these truly horrific weapons of mass destruction. As for Trump, Fihn notes, “if you’re uncomfortable with nuclear weapons under Donald Trump, you’re probably uncomfortable with nuclear weapons.”

Fihn and Hiroshima bombing survivor Setsuko Thurlow jointly accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Dec. 10.","britain france pakistan india

Lindsey Bahr / AP,,2017-12-10T19:41:59Z,time,<i>Coco</i> Tops Box Office Again Before <i>Star Wars</i> Hits,http://time.com/5057874/coco-tops-box-office-again/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/coco.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"(LOS ANGELES) — The animated family film “Coco” has topped the box office for a third time on a quiet, pre “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” weekend in theaters.

Disney estimated Sunday that “Coco” added $18.3 million, which would bring its domestic total to $135.5 million.

The weekend’s sole new wide release was the Morgan Freeman film “Just Getting Started,” which launched to a meager $3.2 million from 2,161 theaters and barely made the top 10.

Most studios have chosen to avoid competing against “The Last Jedi,” which is expected to dominate theaters and moviegoer attention when it opens on Dec. 15.

Thus, most of the charts have looked quite similar for the past few weeks. Warner Bros. and DC’s “Justice League” took second place with $9.6 million and Lionsgate’s sleeper hit “Wonder,” which has now passed $100 million, placed third with $8.5 million. Warner Bros. also crossed the $2 billion benchmark domestically Saturday — the first studio to do so in 2017.

This quiet period before “Star Wars” has allowed some of the indie and prestige titles to thrive in limited releases and expansions, like James Franco’s “The Disaster Artist.” The film, about the making of one of the worst films of all time, “The Room,” expanded to 840 locations in its second weekend in theaters. It managed to bring in $6.4 million, landing it in fourth place.

Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age film “Lady Bird” also added 363 locations and placed 9th in its sixth weekend in theaters. With the $3.5 million from this weekend, “Lady Bird” has netted $22.3 million.

The Guillermo del Toro-directed romantic fantasy “The Shape of Water” expanded to 41 theaters in its second weekend and earned $1.1 million.

The Tonya Harding biopic “I, Tonya” launched in four locations in New York and Los Angeles and brought in a solid $245,602.

The Winston Churchill film “The Darkest Hour” and the summer romance film “Call Me By Your Name” also continue to thrive in more limited releases as well. “The Darkest Hour,” which stars Gary Oldman as Churchill, earned $777,000 from 53 locations, and “Call Me By Your Name,” with Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet, took in $291,101 from nine theaters.

“This is the best time to be a moviegoer if you’re an indie fan,” said comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “The last few weeks have enabled films like ‘The Shape of Water,’ ‘Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri’ and now ‘I, Tonya’ to really find an audience.”

He added: “It’s great time for those films ahead of the box office death star that is ‘Star Wars.'”

The year is still down 4 percent from last year, though, which is a pit that even a juggernaut like “Star Wars” might struggle to fill. The cash influx from “The Last Jedi” will be significant, nonetheless, and if the precedent of “Rogue One” and “The Force Awakens” holds, it could range from $400 million to over $600 million of additional domestic revenue before the books close on 2017.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

1.”Coco,” $18.3 million.

2.”Justice League,” $9.6 million.

3.”Wonder,” $8.5 million.

4.”The Disaster Artist,” $6.4 million.

5.”Thor: Ragnarok,” $6.3 million.

6.”Daddy’s Home 2,” $6 million.

7.”Murder on the Orient Express,” $5.1 million.

8.”The Star,” $3.7 million.

9.”Lady Bird,” $3.5 million.

10.”Just Getting Started,” $3.2 million.","paul dergarabedian

Aron Heller / AP,,2017-12-10T18:36:03Z,time,Israeli Security Guard Stabbed Amid Tensions Over Jerusalem as Clashes Erupt Across Middle East,http://time.com/5057859/middle-east-violence-israel-beirut/?xid=homepage,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/middle-east-violence.jpg?quality=85,general,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"(JERUSALEM) — A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli security guard Sunday at the entrance to Jerusalem’s bustling central bus station, seriously wounding him in the first attack in the volatile city since President Donald Trump recognized it as Israel’s capital.

In Beirut, scores of Lebanese and Palestinian demonstrators clashed with security forces outside the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy over the recognition, while Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo demanded that the United States rescind Trump’s decision, calling it a “grave” development.

The violence came amid days of unrest sparked by Trump’s dramatic announcement Wednesday. The Palestinians staged three “days of rage,” with clashes breaking out in flashpoints around the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

It was not immediately clear whether the bus station attack was motivated by Trump’s move, which upended decades of U.S. foreign policy and drew swift criticism from around the world, including U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East.

Israeli police said the attacker was a 24-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli media identified him as Yassin Abu al-Qarah, who posted on his Facebook page in recent days about Jerusalem, writing “our blood is devoted” to the holy city. Comments on his profile called him a hero for allegedly carrying out the Jerusalem attack.

Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the guard sustained a serious wound to his upper body and the attacker was apprehended.

Israel’s Channel 10 TV news broadcast security camera video showing the attacker removing his jacket near the security gate and then thrusting what looked like a knife into the guard’s chest before fleeing.

Trump’s announcement raised fears about a new wave of violence. Four Palestinians were killed in Gaza in Israeli airstrikes following rocket fire from there and in clashes along the border. In the West Bank, there were dozens of injuries, but no deaths.

Palestinian youths clashed Sunday in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, hurling stones toward Israeli soldiers, who fired back with rubber bullets and tear gas.

There have been more than two years of intermittent attacks in which Palestinians have killed more than 50 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British tourist in stabbings, shootings and car-rammings. Israeli forces have killed more than 260 Palestinians in that time, mostly attackers.

The status of Jerusalem is at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Trump’s move was widely perceived as siding with Israel. Even small crises over Jerusalem and the status of the holy sites in its Old City have brought deadly bloodshed in the past. Trump’s announcement was denounced by critics who suggested he had needlessly stirred more conflict in an already volatile region. Israel captured the eastern sector of the city in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza, territories the Palestinians claim for their future state.

Lebanese security forces broke up the protest outside the U.S. Embassy after demonstrators pelted them with stones. The group gathered hundreds of meters (yards) outside the embassy to reject the move by Trump. After a rowdy start, the protest drew several hundred people and became more peaceful, with demonstrators chanting and singing.

The clashes resumed in the afternoon, with security forces chasing protesters, arresting a handful of them and lobbing tear gas. Lebanon is home to 450,000 Palestinian refugees, nearly 10 percent of the population.

In a resolution long on rhetoric but short on concrete actions, Arab foreign ministers demanded the recognition decision be rescinded and also called for the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning Trump’s decision. They acknowledged that Washington would most likely veto it.

If the U.S. vetoes the resolution, the Arabs would seek a similar resolution in the U.N. General Assembly, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki told a pre-dawn news conference in Cairo.

A two-page resolution adopted by the emergency meeting, which began Saturday night, did not include any punitive actions against the U.S., such as a call for a boycott of American products or changes to ties with Washington.

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., defended Trump’s move Sunday, despite the opposition and violence it sparked.

“For those who want to say this is a bad idea, I’ll tell you: Ask us five or 10 years from now if you still think it’s a bad idea. Because I really do think this is going to move the ball in the peace process,” she told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Trump’s move was embraced in Israel as a long overdue acknowledgement of Israel’s seat of parliament and government and the historic capital of the Jewish people dating back 3,000 years. Upon departing for a diplomatic visit to Paris and Brussels, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was prepared to respond to critics.

“While I respect Europe, I am not prepared to accept a double standard from it. I hear voices from there condemning President Trump’s historic statement but I have not heard condemnations of the rockets fired at Israel or the terrible incitement against it,” he said. “I am not prepared to accept this hypocrisy, and as usual at this important forum I will present Israel’s truth without fear and with head held high.”

Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, called for a boycott of Arab businesses in an area where residents took part in violent protests of the U.S. recognition.

Lieberman said the Arabs of Wadi Ara in northern Israel were “not part of us” and that Jewish Israelis should no longer visit their villages and buy their products. Hundreds of Arab citizens of Israel protested Saturday along a major highway in northern Israel, where dozens of masked rioters hurled stones at buses and police vehicles. Three Israelis were wounded and several vehicles were damaged.

Lieberman has long called for Wadi Ara to be included in his proposed swap of lands and populations as part of a peace agreement with the Palestinians. The residents, like many of Israel’s Arab minority, sympathize with the Palestinians of the West Bank and often openly identify with them. But they are also Israeli citizens who largely reject the notion of becoming part of a future Palestinian state.

The comments sparked criticism of racism and collective punishment toward a community of which only a small minority were violent. It also raised questions about how Israel could aggressively oppose international boycott campaigns against it while one of its most senior ministers called for one against its own citizens.","west bank east jerusalem

Well into what’s considered the wet season, there’s been nary a drop of rain. That’s good news for sun-seeking tourists, but could spell more disaster for a region that emerged this spring from a yearslong drought and now has firefighters on edge because of parched conditions and no end in sight to the typical fire season.

“This is the new normal,” Gov. Jerry Brown warned Saturday after surveying damage from the deadly Ventura County fire that has caused the most destruction. “We’re about ready to have firefighting at Christmas. This is very odd and unusual.”

Even as firefighters made progress containing six major wildfires from Santa Barbara to San Diego County and most evacuees were allowed to return home, predicted gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) through Sunday posed a threat of flaring up existing blazes or spreading new ones. High fire risk is expected to last into January.

Overall, out-of-control fires have destroyed nearly 800 homes and other buildings, killed dozens of horses and forced more than 200,000 people to flee flames that have burned over 270 square miles (700 square kilometers) since Monday. One death, so far, a 70-year-old woman who crashed her car on an evacuation route, is attributed to the fire in Santa Paula, a small city next to Ventura where the fire began.

Firefighters were on high alert for dangerous fire potential even before the first blazes broke out. On Dec. 1, they began planning for extreme winds forecast in the week ahead.

Ken Pimlott, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said authorities were prepared for destruction on the level of 2003 and 2007 firestorms in Southern California and possibly those in Northern California that killed 44 people and destroyed nearly 9,000 homes and buildings in October.

By Monday, they had moved fire crews from the northern part of the state as reinforcements and marshaled engines, bulldozers and aircraft.

On Tuesday they brought in more helicopters from the National Guard and “every last plane we could find in the nation,” said Thom Porter, southern chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The military provided C-130 planes for water drops, said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Office of Emergency Services. More than 290 fire engines came from Montana, Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, Arizona, Oregon and Nevada.

But once flames met ferocious winds, crews were largely powerless to stop them. Even fire-attacking aircraft were helpless while being grounded at times because of night, high winds or smoke.

As fires burned in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, firefighters from other states were already in place north of San Diego on Thursday when a major fire erupted and rapidly spread in the Fallbrook area, known for its avocado groves and horse stables in the rolling hills.

“We had many resources in the area very quickly on this incident, but unfortunately within several minutes the fire had gotten out of control and well-established, and necessitated massive evacuations,” said Steve Abbott, chief of the North County Fire Protection District.

The fire swept through the San Luis Rey Training Facility, where it killed an estimated 30 to 40 elite thoroughbreds and destroyed more than 100 homes — most of them in the Rancho Monserate Country Club retirement community. Three people were burned trying to escape.

Most of the fires this week were in places that suffered from major fires in the past, including one in the ritzy Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air that burned 6 homes and another in the city’s rugged foothills community of Sylmar and Santa Paula.

The fire in Fallbrook was no exception. Ten years ago, during a deadly spate of Santa Ana wind-driven infernos, flames wiped out most of the more than 200 homes in the Valley Oaks Mobile Home Park.

Memories of that blaze were fresh as flames approached Thursday and sheriff’s deputies told residents to leave immediately.

By the time he got the order to go, Mateo Gonzalez had already helped his brother move out of his nearby place and packed all of his important belongings.

In the 2007 firestorm, he had almost no warning before his house was destroyed, only four months after moving in.

“We weren’t prepared the first time around. This time we were,” he said Friday as he returned to his undamaged home.","california department of forestry

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric says Saturday that Feltman and his hosts agreed that the Korean situation is “the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue” in the world today.”

Feltman’s visit came at a time of high tension between North Korea, South Korea, Japan and the United States, sparked by North Korea’s frequent missile launches.

Dujarric says Feltman told the North Koreans there can only be a diplomatic solution.","north korea south korea japan

Al Franken, who used to work on the show.

The cold open skit begins with cast member Kenan Thompson dressed as Santa and greeting children who have various questions about the sexual harassment scandals that have recently plagued the political world. Kate McKinnon stands alongside Thompson, dressed as an elf.

After asking for a Mega Bloks dinosaur and laser tag, a boy named Tyler asks: “Can you tell me, what did Al Franken do?”

Franken announced on Thursday that he was resigning from the Senate after multiple women had accused him of sexual harassment.

Thompson appears dumbfounded by the question and defers to McKinnon, who says she can’t answer the question either. Thompson ultimately tells Tyler that Franken is on Santa’s naughty list this year. Tyler then asks what list Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is on. Multiple women have said Moore pursued them romantically when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.

“It’s not really a list, it’s more of a registry,” McKinnson explains.

After Tyler, a girl named Jessica visits Santa, and wants to know if President Donald Trump is on the naughty list. As Thompson tries to explain Santa is apolitical, McKinnon interjects, saying: “Nineteen accusers, Google it.” A succession of other children come up, all with political questions Thompson is uncomfortable answering. The skit ends with a message from McKinnon who tells the last child to visit Santa: “Most people in America are good people. And eventually, good people will fix our country.”

The tombs, located on the west bank of the river Nile in a cemetery for noblemen and top officials, are the latest discovery in the city famed for its temples and tombs spanning different dynasties of ancient Egyptian history.

“It’s truly an exceptional day,” Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani said. “The 18th dynasty private tombs were already known. But it’s the first time to enter inside the two tombs.”

A picture taken on December 9, 2017 shows skulls and bone fragments found at a newly discovered tomb in the Draa Abul Naga necropolis on the west Nile bank of the southern Egyptian city of Luxor, about 650 kilometres (400 miles) south of the capital Cairo. STRINGER—AFP/Getty Images

Al-Anani said the discoveries are part of the ministry’s efforts to promote Egypt’s vital tourism industry, partially driven by antiquities sightseeing, that was hit hard by extremist attacks and political turmoil following the 2011 uprising.

The ministry said one tomb has a courtyard lined with mud-brick and stone walls and contains a six-meter (yard) burial shaft leading to four side chambers. The artifacts found inside were mostly fragments of wooden coffins. Wall inscriptions and paintings suggest it belongs to era between the reigns King Amenhotep II and King Thutmose IV, both pharaohs of the 18th dynasty.

A picture taken on December 9, 2017 shows ancient Egyptian wooden funerary masks and small statuettes found in and retrieved from the newly discovered ""Kampp 150"" tomb at Draa Abul Naga necropolis on the west Nile bank of the southern Egyptian city of Luxor, about 650 kilometres (400 miles) south of the capital Cairo.

The other tomb has five entrances leading to a rectangular hall and contains two burial shafts located in the northern and southern sides of the tomb.

Among the artifacts found inside are funerary cones, painted wooden funerary masks, clay vessels, a collection of some 450 statues and a mummy wrapped in linen who was likely of a top official. A cartouche carved on the ceiling bears the name of King Thutmose I of the early 18th dynasty.

The Antiquities Ministry has made a string of discoveries since the beginning of 2017 in several provinces across Egypt — including the tomb of a royal goldsmith in the same area and belonging to the same dynasty, whose work was dedicated to the ancient Egyptian god Amun.","draa abul naga necropolis

The test, which took place Sept. 3, was the country’s sixth and largest underground nuclear test, according to Reuters.

“They’re probably relaxation events from the sixth nuclear test. When you have a large nuclear test, it moves the earth’s crust around the area, and it takes a while for it to fully subside. We’ve had a few of them since the sixth nuclear test,” a U.S. Geological Survey official told Reuters.

There have been a number of tremors felt in the area since the test, prompting experts to think that the mountainous area may have been damaged as a result of the tests, Reuters reported.

Pyongyang claimed that they tested a hydrogen bomb, and has suggested that its next test would be conducted above ground. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has also said that all of the United States is now within the country’s range.","united states

On Sunday, as the campaign reached the bell lap before Tuesday’s voting, things got even weirder: Roy Moore was nowhere to be found.

Tom Barnes, Cullman County campaign chair for Moore, says he can solve the mystery. “Roy is at the Army-Navy game [Saturday in Philadelphia] to see his son. So that’s where he was yesterday,” Barnes told VICE News Saturday in an interview at the makeshift Cullman County Moore headquarters. “Family comes before politics with Roy.”

Barnes is an old Moore friend and fellow West Point alumnus. He says he texts with Moore often and that the two are close, though Barnes was uncertain whether Moore watched the game from inside the stadium or at his hotel due to security concerns. Rich Hobson, Moore’s campaign manager, repeatedly declined to confirm Barnes’ story when reached by VICE News Saturday. When asked if he denied it, he said “I have no comment.”","cullman county moore

It effectively disqualified the U.S. from leading the peace process in the eyes of the Palestinians, diplomats and analysts told VICE News.

“All of the Palestinians that I’ve talked to over the last couple days are saying: ‘Washington is now irrelevant to negotiations, and we don’t care what you say,’” said Hady Amr, U.S. deputy special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under Barack Obama. “The PLO is humiliated and angry. Hamas is enraged.”

Ruling the U.S. out of future peace talks entirely would be premature, experts said, given its uniquely close ties to Israel. Yet Trump’s decision opens a void that no other country can easily fill. One nation in particular, however, seems eager to try: Russia.

Russia has dramatically raised its profile in the Middle East since launching a military operation in 2015 that rescued Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s crumbling regime in the face of resurgent rebel forces and repeated American declarations that the dictator must step down. Invigorated by its success in Syria, Russia has demonstrated a sort of diplomatic swagger the Middle East hasn’t seen since Cold War days, filling power vacuums left by America’s pullback in key arenas, diplomats and analysts said.","israelipalestinian

Cory Booker called on President Donald Trump to resign Saturday night over the allegations of sexual harassment that have dogged him since the presidential campaign.

Booker made the comments at a campaign appearance in Alabama for Democratic candidate Doug Jones, who is locked in a tight race against a Republican candidate facing his own allegations of sexual abuse, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore.

Sen. Al Franken resigned this week under growing pressure from members of his own party after multiple women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. But Booker said Trump’s record was worse.

“I just watched Sen. Al Franken do the honorable thing and resign from his office. My question is, why isn’t Donald Trump doing the same thing — who has more serious allegations against him, with more women who have come forward. The fact pattern on him is far more damning than the fact pattern on Al Franken,” Booker said in an interview with VICE News.

Read: Why Alabama voters are sticking with Roy Moore

Franken faced accusations from at least seven women, while Trump has been accused by at least fifteen women of sexual assault or harassment since the 1980s, with many coming forward to speak out against the Republican during the 2016 presidential race.

Trump denied the accusations and weathered the storm of controversy at the time. But as the nation grapples with a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men in politics, media, the entertainment industry, and elsewhere, some Democrats say the allegations against the president should be re-litigated.

“Why hasn’t Donald Trump come forward and said, ‘You know what, in this climate, at this point in this country, I’m going to resign from my position just like Al Franken,” Booker said.

Within the final weeks of the campaign, multiple women have come forward with allegations that Moore pursued romantic and even sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers and Moore was nearly twice their age.

Read: Former Franken staffers wonder if the #MeToo movement got the wrong guy

The allegations have upended what should’ve been an easily winnable race for the Republican, with some in Moore’s own party calling on him to drop out of the race as some polls showed the race tightening. But this past week, Trump came out in support of Moore, endorsing him at a rally in Florida on Friday night and even cutting a robocall for the candidate over the weekend.

The endorsement could provide a significant boost for the Republican in a state that Trump won with nearly 63 percent of the vote.

But Jones has gone hard after Moore over the allegations in recent weeks, framing the race as a choice between Moore and a candidate that won’t “embarrass” the state of Alabama. Booker went even further on Saturday, telling VICE News that the allegations against Moore should be disqualifying.

“If a person is banned from a mall they should definitely not be in the United States Senate,” Booker said, referring to reports that Moore had been banned from a local mall decades before because of his interactions with young girls.

He also said he was “absolutely” concerned that if Moore were elected he would harass Senate pages, the teenagers that work as Senate interns on Capitol Hill.

“I am worried, there are former pages that are showing worry, there are Republican senators that are worried — we’re all worried about this nightmare of a person that could come to the United States senate,” he said.

And he raised the prospect of voting to expel Moore from the senate if elected, promising to “do everything I can not to serve” with him. It would be a drastic move — and one that remains unlikely, as it would require Republican support to succeed.

Why is the price of bitcoin rocketing upwards?

While there’s no single answer to this, lot of it has to do with increased activity — money transfers and investments — coming from Asia over the past few months, as well as traditional finance players.

“The size of the movement is indicative of institutional money investing in bitcoin rather than retail investors,” according to Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director of Coin Center, a Washington-based cryptocurrency think tank.","peter van valkenburgh

Trump made it look like an aside during a stump speech.



“This guy’s screaming ‘we want Roy Moore,’” Trump told a crowd in a minor league hockey arena just across the border from Alabama in Pensacola. “He’s right.”



The president didn’t just say Moore was a potential political ally, which he’s said before. He didn’t just say voters can’t know the truth about allegations Moore pursued and sexually assaulted teenage girls in the 1970s while Moore was in his thirties — which he’s said that before too.



Trump said it’s starting to look like those allegations are false.



“Did you see what happened today? You know the yearbook?” Trump said. “Did you see that? There was a little mistake made, She started writing things in the yearbook.”



Trump was reading the room well. Moore supporters were waiting in line before the Pensacola rally were talking about the revelation that Moore accuser Beverly Young Nelson, brought to the public by famed feminist attorney Gloria Allred, had written part of a yearbook signature Allred had strongly suggested was written in full by Moore in the ‘70s.



Nelson used the signature as proof of an encounter when she said Moore assaulted her. On Friday, she and Allred said Moore had still written the signature, but not the date and location written below it. They presented a handwriting analysis to prove that Moore had written in the yearbook.



But Moore supporters looking for anything to support their belief that the numerous allegations of pedophillic behavior by Moore are false latched onto the amended story of the of signature.



Trump was right there with them.



“Gloria Allred … anytime you see her you know something’s gone wrong,” Trump said.



There was a time when Trump was campaigning against Moore. That was in September, during the Republican primary for the Alabama special election. There was a time that Trump tiptoed around the allegations against Moore. That was back in November, when the allegations first emerged. And there was a time that Trump was supporting Moore solely because he was a Republican running against a Democrat. That was a few days ago.



On Friday, Trump was a Moore supporter in full, backing him both as a Senate candidate and a victim of false accusation.

“Get out and vote for Roy Moore,” Trump urged the room. “Do It. Do it.”","pensacola florida

"Abby Rabinowitz,Amanda Simson",The Paris agreement on climate change charts a narrow path to avoiding a global apocalypse. Just one problem: Its centerpiece is a technology that basically doesn’t yet exist.,2017-12-10T12:00:00Z,wired,The Dirty Secret of the IPCC’s Plan to Avert Climate Disaster: BECCS (Carbon Capture Technology) Doesn’t Yet Exist.,https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-secret-of-the-worlds-plan-to-avert-climate-disaster/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a2b3cbf15e73c599bf9542b/191:100/pass/Wired.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"In 2014 Henrik Karlsson, a Swedish entrepreneur whose startup was failing, was lying in bed with a bankruptcy notice when the BBC called. The reporter had a scoop: On the eve of releasing a major report, the United Nation’s climate change panel appeared to be touting an untried technology as key to keeping planetary temperatures at safe levels. The technology went by the inelegant acronym BECCS, and Karlsson was apparently the only BECCS expert the reporter could find. Karlsson was amazed. The bankruptcy notice was for his BECCS startup, which he’d founded seven years earlier after an idea came to him while watching a late-night television show in Gothenburg, Sweden. The show explored the benefits of capturing carbon dioxide before it was emitted from power plants. It’s the technology behind the much-touted notion of “clean coal,” a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change. Karlsson, then a 27-year-old studying to be an operatic tenor, was no climate scientist or engineer. Still, the TV show got him thinking: During photosynthesis plants naturally suck carbon dioxide from the air, storing it in their leaves, branches, seeds, roots, and trunks. So what if you grew crops and then burned those crops for electricity, being sure to capture all of the carbon dioxide emitted? You’d then store all that dangerous CO 2 underground. Such a power plant wouldn’t just be emitting less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, it would effectively be sucking CO 2 from the air. Karlsson was enraptured with the idea. He was going to help avert a global disaster. The next morning, he ran to the library, where he read a 2001 Science paper by Austrian modeler Michael Obersteiner theorizing the same idea, which was later dubbed “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage”—BECCS. Karlsson was sold. He launched his BECCS startup in 2007, riding the wave of optimism generated by Al Gore’s first climate change movie. Karlsson’s company even became a finalist in Richard Bransen’s Virgin Earth Challenge, which was offering $25 million for a scalable solution for removing greenhouse gases. But by 2014, Karlsson’s startup was a failure. He took the BBC’s call as a sign that he shouldn’t give up. In the report, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—universally known by yet another acronym, IPCC—presented results from hundreds of computer-model-generated scenarios in which the planet’s temperature rises less than 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, the limit eventually set by the Paris Climate Agreement. The 2°C goal was a theoretical limit for how much warming humans could accept. For leading climatologist James Hansen, even the 2°C limit is unsafe. And without emissions cuts, global temperatures are projected to rise by 4°C by the end of the century. Many scientists are reluctant to make predictions, but the apocalyptic litany of what a 4°C world could hold includes widespread drought, famine, climate refugees by the millions, civilization-threatening warfare, and a sea level rise that would permanently drown much of New York, Miami, Mumbai, Shanghai, and other coastal cities. But here’s where things get weird. The UN report envisions 116 scenarios in which global temperatures are prevented from rising more than 2°C. In 101 of them, that goal is accomplished by sucking massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—a concept called “negative emissions”—chiefly via BECCS. And in these scenarios to prevent planetary disaster, this would need to happen by midcentury, or even as soon as 2020. Like a pharmaceutical warning label, one footnote warned that such “methods may carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale.” Indeed, following the scenarios’ assumptions, just growing the crops needed to fuel those BECCS plants would require a landmass one to two times the size of India, climate researchers Kevin Anderson and Glen Peters wrote. The energy BECCS was supposed to supply is on par with all of the coal-fired power plants in the world. In other words, the models were calling for an energy revolution—one that was somehow supposed to occur well within millennials’ lifetimes. Today that vast future sector of the economy amounts to one working project in the world: a repurposed corn ethanol plant in Decatur, Illinois. Which raises a question: Has the world come to rely on an imaginary technology to save it?

On December 12, 2015, 195 nations—including the US—adopted the Paris Climate Agreement, finally promising to keep global temperature rise well below 2°C above preindustrial levels this century, with a further goal of keeping them below 1.5°C. Christiana Figueres, the UN diplomat who shepherded global climate talks from their post-Copenhagen standstill, remembers “5,000 people jumping out of their seats, crying, clapping, screaming, yelling, torn between euphoria and still disbelief.” But that euphoria masked a hard truth. The plausibility of the Paris Climate Agreement’s goals rested on what was lurking in the UN report’s fine print: massive negative emissions achieved primarily through BECCS—an unproven concept to put it mildly. How did BECCS get into the models? The story begins with the 2°C goal itself, a formal international climate target since 2010 (and informal since the 1990s). For years before Paris, climate researchers had warned that the 2°C limit was slipping out of reach—or was already unattainable. Here’s why: As climate researchers have clearly (and tirelessly) linked temperature rise to increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, they can calculate back from a temperature target to the maximum amount of CO 2 we can emit—our “carbon budget.” For a greater than 66 percent chance of staying below 2°C of warming, our CO 2 concentration should remain under 450 parts per million. In 2010, when the 2°C goal was adopted at a major conference in Cancun, Mexico, the carbon budget for 450 ppm, or 2°C, was formidably tight: Only a third was left—1,000 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Since humans were emitting 40 gigatons a year, the carbon budget would be easily blown before midcentury. This is the global accounting problem that a handful of specialized modeling groups began confronting in 2004, when the IPCC asked them to map scenarios in line with the 2°C goal. Essentially, how might we cut emissions without grinding the fossil-fuel-driven economy to an immediate standstill? To tackle this problem, the groups used a tool called an integrated assessment model—algorithms that draw on climate, economic, political, and technical data to imagine cost-effective policy solutions. Around the same time that Karlsson’s life changed via late-night Swedish television, Detlef Van Vuuren, a project leader of the Dutch modeling group IMAGE, came across the idea behind BECCS in the literature, looking at Obersteiner’s 2001 paper and work by Christian Azar and Jose Moreira. He was intrigued. In theory, by both producing energy and sucking CO 2 out of the atmosphere BECCS could result in a path to 2°C that the global economy could afford. The key was that BECCS resulted in negative emissions, which, in the carbon budget, worked like a negative number. It was like having a climate credit card: Negative emissions allowed modelers to “overshoot” the carbon emissions budget in the short term, permitting greenhouse gases to rise (as they were doing in reality) and then paying back the debt by sucking the CO 2 from the atmosphere later. “The idea of negative emissions became a deeply logical one,” Van Vuuren says. The rationale behind negative emissions relied heavily on the work of physicist Klaus Lackner, who at the turn of the millennia was sketching schemes for CO 2 removal on blackboards for his students at Columbia University. Lackner, who was working on carbon capture and storage (then intended for storing emissions from coal-fired power plants), was the first person to suggest the idea of direct air capture—pulling CO 2 out of the air. At that time, Lackner’s idea of direct air capture, like BECCS, was just theoretical. But Van Vuuren says that for the purposes of the models, BECCS could be said to exist, at least in its component parts. The IPCC had published a report on carbon capture and storage—and bioenergy just meant burning lots of crops. Some models did ultimately include direct air capture and another negative emissions technique, afforestation (planting lots of trees, which naturally absorb and store CO 2 in the process of photosynthesis). But BECCS was cheaper because it produced electricity. In 2007 IMAGE published an influential paper relying on BECCS in Climatic Change, and garnered much attention at an IPCC expert meeting. Other groups started putting BECCS into their models too, which is how it came to dominate those included in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (the one that prompted the BBC to call Karlsson). The models assumed BECCS on a vast scale. According to an analysis that British climate researcher Jason Lowe shared with Carbon Brief, at median the models called for BECCS to remove 630 gigatons of CO 2 , roughly two-thirds of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted between preindustrial times and 2011. Was that reasonable? Not for James Hansen, who wrote that reliance on negative emissions had quietly “spread like a cancer” through the scenarios, along with the assumption that young people would somehow figure out how to extract CO 2 at a cost he later projected to be $140–570 trillion this century. Anderson (of the India calculations) pointed out that the few 2°C scenarios without BECCS required CO 2 emissions to peak back in 2010—something, he noted wryly, that “clearly has not occurred.” In a scathing letter in 2015, Anderson accused scientists of using negative emissions to sanitize their research for policymakers, calling them a “deux ex machina.” Fellow critics argued that the integrated assessment models had become a political device to make the 2°C goal seem more plausible than it was. Oliver Geden, who heads the EU division of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, raised the alarm in the popular press. In a New York Times op-ed during the conference, he called negative emissions “magical thinking”—a concept, he says, meant to keep the “story” of 2°C, the longtime goal of international climate negotiations, alive. For Van Vuuren and other modelers we interviewed, this criticism is misplaced. Integrated assessment models are not meant be predictive, they emphasize, because no one can predict future technology—or political decisions. Nor are they action plans. Rather, for Van Vuuren, the models are “explorations” meant to show the kinds of policy decisions and investments necessary to reach the 2°C goal. Given that, Van Vuuren sees a “worrying gap” between the reliance on BECCS in the scenarios and how few research programs and projects there are in the real world. Whether the IPCC’s scenarios are political cover or research guides for policymakers depends on who you ask. But either way, this gap is undeniable. It can be explained in part by the fact that BECCS is a conceptual tool, not an actual technology that anyone in the engineering world (apart from a few outliers like Karlsson) is championing. At a recent meeting in Berlin, one climate researcher called BECCS “the devil child,” which got laughs; bioenergy and carbon capture have both met their share of criticism—bioenergy for displacing agricultural crops needed to feed people and carbon capture for, among other things, being perceived as diverting attention from the need for massive emissions cuts. For that reason, in an article last year in Science, Anderson and Peters called relying on negative emissions “an unjust and high-stakes gamble” and a “moral hazard” that allows policymakers to avoid making tough emissions cuts right now. Replying in a letter, Klaus Lackner, the carbon capture pioneer, cautioned that their argument risked shutting down a necessary avenue of research. “If we had this conversation in 1980,” he says, it would have been different. Now, with our carbon budget blown, he argues, potential negative emissions technologies are “a life preserver.” Here’s the hardest truth: Even if negative emissions debuted in highly crafted, impractical computer models, we now need negative emissions in the real world to keep the planet’s temperatures at safe levels. Temperatures have already risen 1.2 to 1.3°C (or 2.1 to 2.3°F). Current carbon dioxide concentrations, meanwhile, hover around 406 ppm. According to Sabine Fuss and Jan Minx of the Mercatur Research Institute, our 1.5°C budget is more or less blown—a widely shared conclusion. (If you’re feeling morbid, you can check the Institute’s running carbon budget clock here). Without a drastic increase in international action on cutting emissions, they say, the carbon budget for 2°C will likely be blown by 2030. So the question is, can negative emissions technology work in the real world, on a global scale? To explore that question, we visited the project in Decatur, Illinois, that modelers cite as evidence that BECCS actually exists.

Workers at the Archer Daniel Midland plant in Decatur, Illinois, inject pure carbon dioxide into underground reservoirs. Theoretically, it can stay there forever. Daniel Byers You may not have expected the future to look like this—what you find if you drive south from Chicago, following directions to Memphis, bearing right through several million acres of green-stalked corn, past the DIY pro-gun signs and the DIY pro-biofuels signs (“not middle east oil fields/soy biodiesel fields”). This is where, 10 years ago, before the biofuels market went bust, people could see their fortunes—fields of soy and corn—stretching to the horizon. At Decatur, you exit toward the Archer Daniel Midland plant, which looks from a distance, with its blocky white towers and mysterious dome, like the Emerald City seen without Oz’s green glasses. When you pull up to the secured gates, ADM’s Decatur plant resolves into a jumble of substations, large tanks, and pipelines, all bathed in a troubling odor reminiscent of cat food. Here, trains and trucks deliver corn and soy by the ton to be processed into chemicals for food and ethanol for fuel. And somewhere in the guts of this Midwestern agricultural giant is the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture Project—otherwise known as the world’s one and only BECCS plant. “I warned you there wasn’t much to see,” says Sallie Greenberg, a geologist and the associate director for energy research and development at the Illinois State Geological Survey, ADM’s project partner, as she unlocks the white trailer that serves as project headquarters. Still, she says, more than 900 people have visited the project, from 30 countries: “It’s world-class.” The ADM plant is an ideal site for carbon capture and storage, which is why, almost 15 years ago, the US Department of Energy initiated a pilot project here. Deep in the plant, sugar from corn kernels is fermented to make ethanol, a reaction that also produces CO 2 eminently easy to “capture”: You just have to separate the gas from the ethanol and remove a little water. From there the CO 2 is pressurized, piped, and injected way down into a saline sandstone reservoir, handily located 7,000 feet below the plant. To see the new injection well, which began operating last May, we drove back out of the plant, following signs for Progress City—agricultural showgrounds owned by ADM where community members were enjoying unseasonably warm October weather on Family Safety Day. A mile from the plant, we pulled up to a fenced-off injector—a rusty pipe, with a few bends and gauges, that disappeared into a cement block in the ground. We stood there as carbon dioxide shot into the earth, silently and out of sight. Currently, more than 1.4 million tons of CO 2 that might have been polluting the atmosphere are stored underground. In theory it was impressive; in reality we were in denuded cornfields looking at piping that seemed oddly rusty for a state-of-the-art project. To be fair, of course, its most impressive installation was invisible, underground. Were we seeing the modelers’ world-saving technology in action? ADM is not BECCS as the models imagined it—that is, a power plant producing electricity by burning crops. Greenberg, in fact, only encountered the term BECCS in the past few years, despite starting work on the project in 2005, and tells us no integrated assessment modeler had ever given her a call. But through happenstance, Decatur is the world’s first BECCS plant. The corn-turned-to-ethanol process is technically “bioenergy,” and ADM’s process does achieve negative emissions, at least by back of the envelope calculations. Roughly two-thirds of the corn’s carbon becomes ethanol, which is emitted into the atmosphere after being burned in car engines. The other third of the corn’s carbon is pumped underground. Greenberg tells us the team has yet to do a granular carbon accounting that includes details like the cost of transporting the corn, but then a BECCS proof-of-concept was not the project’s original goal. One argument the ADM project does make for BECCS is that we could store a lot of carbon dioxide underground forever. Once in the saline reservoir, the CO 2 reacts with brine and rock, which binds it in place, and the basin is topped with a layer of impermeable rock, ensuring the gas won’t escape. In monitoring the location of the CO 2 underground, the team has seen no sign of movement or a leak. “It can stay there forever,” Greenberg says. And this one single reservoir can likely store carbon dioxide on the order of 100 billion tons, according to surveys, which makes the the prospect of storing 600 billion tons—the amount envisioned in the models—seem reasonable. On the other hand, the project neatly highlights the scale of the BECCS challenge. For perspective, the Decatur facility plans to store another 5 million tons of carbon dioxide over the next few years—and in 2016, average US emissions were 14 million tons of carbon dioxide per day. So how many BECCS plants would we need? If you really consider the question, you realize how hard it is to answer. In a recent paper, engineers Mathilde Fajardy and Niall Mac Dowell, of Imperial College in London, explore best- and worst-case BECCS scenarios in excruciating detail. In worst-case scenarios (say, burning willow grown on grasslands in Europe), it’s possible to never even achieve negative emissions. You spend too much carbon transporting crops, preparing land, and building a plant. And even in best-case scenarios (using fast-growing elephant grass on marginal cropland in Brazil), you still need land use on par with Anderson’s multiples of India and water use on par with what we currently use for all agriculture in the world. “If you extrapolate the amount of agricultural production to the scale you would need, it’s going to be a disaster,” Lackner told us. Then there’s the money problem. BECCS plants are simply not profitable—burning vegetation is roughly half as efficient as burning coal. In the US, we could incentivize BECCS by charging companies for the carbon dioxide they emit—but the carbon tax plan advocated by a few US Republican leaders is decidedly not in line with the Trump administration’s climate agenda. As it is, some American companies do get tax credits for storing CO 2 underground, but, apart from ADM, they do so for “enhanced oil recovery,” pumping CO 2 into nearly dry wells to extract hard-to-reach oil. While some of the CO 2 stays underground, the process frees ever more fossil fuels to be burned. So driving away from Decatur, despite the project’s competence, it was difficult to imagine using BECCS on anything like the scenarios’ scale. We shared our concerns with Noah Deich, a self-described recovering management consultant and founder of the world’s first (and only) negative emissions advocacy organization, the Center for Carbon Removal. Deich advised us to look at negative emissions technology differently—not as one catch-all solution but, rather, as a “portfolio.” This portfolio includes natural approaches for carbon capture, like developing carbon sinks (land that captures more CO 2 than it emits), afforestation (planting trees), and biochar (a charcoal soil additive that permanently stores CO 2 ), as well as technologies like BECCS plants and direct air capture. For now, this portfolio’s direct air capture technologies exist mainly at lab bench scale. At Arizona State University, notably, Lackner is experimenting with small, portable boxes to scrub carbon dioxide from the air. But companies with a workable business plan for turning a profit are rare. One of them belongs to a charismatic Harvard climate researcher named David Keith. The Decatur facility plans to store another 5 million tons of carbon dioxide over the next few years—but in 2016, average US emissions were 14 million tons of carbon dioxide per day. Daniel Byers In monitoring the location of the CO 2 underground, the team has seen no sign of movement or a leak. Daniel Byers

In Squamish, an hour’s drive from Vancouver, the world doesn’t seem to need saving. The town is tucked on a narrow peninsula between a deep-blue inner channel and British Columbia’s snowcapped coastal ranges, and it is a favorite with climbers, who crowd the Starbucks. There’s a rumor that Microsoft is planning to build a campus here. Down one fork of the peninsula, on the site of a plant that once made chemicals for the pulp paper industry, is a startup founded in 2009 by Keith, with funding from Bill Gates—one of a handful of direct air capture companies in the world. Inside the headquarters, wholesome engineers in nubby sweaters drink coffee at a common table, and a check-in board lists the names of three dogs, who roam the office at will. Just this week, the team reached a long awaited milestone: They created synthetic fuel (that could be used to run a car) from nothing more than carbon dioxide captured from air and hydrogen harvested from water. Why fuel? To not only demonstrate direct air capture at scale but also to show how to make a profit from free-floating CO 2 —an aspect of negative emissions that, as BECCS makes clear, can be elusive. On a tour of the pilot plant, Geoff Holmes, a former graduate student of Keith’s and his business development manager, fends off expressions of awe by explaining that carbon dioxide can also be captured using equipment found in a high school chemistry lab (as recently demonstrated by a New York City student). Carbon Engineering’s experiment, which runs on a construction site and in a cavernous barn, involves four structures linked by various pipes, giving it the feeling of an ingenious, supersized game of Mousetrap. The first step is an air contactor, where the carbon dioxide, which is acidic once in solution, is absorbed by potassium hydroxide (a base). In a silo-like “pelleter,” the carbon dioxide is transformed into pellets of calcium carbonate (chalk) via one more high school chemistry reaction. Holding them in your hand, they look like small white marbles. Theoretically, the CO 2 could remain trapped in these pellets forever. The pellets are heated in a calciner to release the carbon dioxide and, to make the process “closed loop,” the remaining calcium is recycled for another round. When running, the process’s only inputs are air, water, and electricity, which in British Columbia, conveniently, is almost entirely provided by renewable hydroelectric power. The only output is a pure stream of carbon dioxide gas. Next step: crafting the carbon dioxide into something saleable. This year, Swiss direct air capture startup Climeworks began selling its carbon dioxide to a nearby greenhouse. Carbon Engineering chose to create a gasoline-like fuel, using an approach known as the Fischer-Tropsch process. The technology dates back to the 1920s and usually involves drawing carbon and hydrogen from coal. (The Germans did this during WWII because they lacked oil.) Carbon Engineering’s hydrogen, on the other hand, comes from water. With these materials, the pilot plant can produce a few barrels of clear synthetic fuel a day, which, with oil at $60 a barrel, will not immediately pay many salaries at the 32-person company. “To develop a technology in this space, it takes a long time and a lot of money,” says CEO Adrian Corless. Within four years, Corless says, they plan to scale up to a demonstration plant that can produce thousands of barrels of fuel a day. The potential market: states like California and British Columbia, which reward companies for using more efficient fuel—regulations that can make this fuel competitive. So does Carbon Engineering’s fuel count as negative emissions? No—it’s at best carbon neutral, as each carbon atom captured will return to the atmosphere when the fuel is burned. But in theory, the company could run this plant for negative emissions instead of fuel, injecting the captured CO 2 underground—if and when the market is willing to pay for such a service. Skyping from his office in Cambridge, Keith, famous for pioneering far-out solar geoengineering, tells us he started Carbon Engineering because direct air capture struck him as “a technology that it would be useful to have if we knew what it cost.” He later clarified, “The best way I know to figure out cost is to roll up your sleeves and jump into engineering process development.” But when asked if it can have a global impact, Keith resisted describing direct air capture as a silver bullet technology, an attitude echoed by the rest of the team. He did tell us that cheap, low-impact direct air capture could have “big environmental benefits.” In all, Keith is wary of descriptors like “novel,” or “pioneering,” or even “interesting,” that lead us to imagine some revolutionary technology will come along to save the world. He remind us that some of most important technological developments toward mitigating climate change have not been eureka-like breakthroughs, but painstaking, incremental engineering success stories, like increasingly low-cost silicon solar panels, which have been around since the 1970s. To make this point, in the company’s early days, he even posted a sign in the office that read “No Science.” To be clear, Keith thinks we need concerted research on negative emissions technology of all kinds, because carbon concentrations are already too high. “Cutting emissions doesn’t solve the climate problem,” Keith says “It just stops it from getting worse.” Visiting Carbon Engineering, what’s clear is that this research requires not just conceptual solutions or parameters in a computer model but also people “grinding it out,” as Keith puts it, day by day, for years—just to turn a technology whose every component part has existed on a lab bench for decades into meaningful reality. And it’s also clear, as the IPCC’s scenarios utterly disguise, how hard this kind of applied research can be, even with a visionary genius, funding from two billionaires, and the kind of can-do, optimistic attitude you’d expect from a team of Canadian engineers. Over the phone, hours after the team made what everyone was casually calling “first fuel,” Holmes cheerfully explains that Carbon Engineering is actually not the first to make fuel from carbon dioxide captured from the air. But, he emphasizes, they are the first to do so on equipment that can be scaled up commercially. The first, in that sense, to show it can be useful. At the Carbon Engineering plant in Squamish, British Columbia, engineers are making auto fuel from elements drawn from the air and chemically mixed with water.

David Pierce,"The $80 Ember Ceramic Mug keeps 10 ounces of coffee at whatever temperature you want, for as long as you want.",2017-12-10T15:00:00Z,wired,I Can't Stop Drinking Coffee Out of This Temperature-Regulating Mug,https://www.wired.com/story/ember-ceramic-mug-rants-and-raves/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a2adf2aba20820595a08d78/191:100/pass/ember-FA.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"My daily coffee routine goes something like this: I arrive at the office, drop my bag next to my desk, grab my mug, and head to the kitchen. I fill it to the brim with the delicious Stumptown brews WIRED provides and bring it back to my desk. Then begins a careful countdown: I have to wait a few minutes for the joe to cool, then drink it as fast as possible before it gets cold. I usually fail, and end up tossing (or begrudgingly chugging) about a third of my mug's contents when I head back for a refill. Rinse and repeat, too many times a day.

Over the last couple of weeks, the Ember Ceramic Mug has changed all of this. The mug keeps 10 ounces of coffee at whatever temperature you want, for as long as you want. You choose the exact temperature in Ember's companion app, or pick from a preset.

Is spending $80 on a mug a ridiculous indulgence, much like $14 avocado toast and those super-expensive candles that supposedly smell like your hometown? Yes. It's also wonderful. See, every beverage has an ideal temperature for consumption. For coffee, science says it's 136 degrees. (Ember defaults to 135, which I guess is a neater number.) It's hot without scalding, and leaves enough room for you to taste the flavors of the coffee rather than simply broiling your taste buds. Ember keeps my coffee exactly right, for hours on end.

The Ceramic Mug is Ember's second product, after its $150 travel mug. That one has a tiny, integrated screen to display the temperature, which you can control on the mug itself by twisting the bottom. But it only holds 12 ounces of coffee, which isn't enough for any ""travel"" longer than walking the dog. Plus, $150 is too much even for a coffee addict like me.

The Ceramic Mug's not for travel, of course. It doesn't even have a lid. It's for puttering around the house with that first cuppa, or for keeping your java steamy while you duck in and out of meetings all day at the office. It does feel slightly odd to walk around at work with a crisp white mug, as if I should also be wearing slippers and yawning into the morning sun like the star of a Raisin Bran commercial. The taste still makes it worth it.

Bring the Heat

The technology inside this mug has implications far beyond coffee. You can imagine all the ways it might be applied: in dishware, baby bottles, beer steins. But Ember CEO Clay Alexander decided to start with a mug for a few simple reasons: One, everybody drinks coffee, many of them several times a day. Those people are increasingly willing to spend money to get better coffee. They're already buying burr grinders for their kitchens, Blue Bottle pourovers on the go. And with coffee, Alexander had a perfect way to pitch his product. ""We all know how much it sucks to have burning-hot coffee or lukewarm coffee,"" he says. You can picture the hokey infomercial already.

Heating and cooling things is easy, but doing so uniformly poses a challenge. In his initial tests, Alexander put thermoelectric coolers on a vessel full of liquid, pulling out all the heat energy. But heat rises, and so he'd simply be cooling and re-cooling the same cold liquid while the stuff at the top stayed hot. Eventually, Alexander realized the solution was to create a convection current, like a radiator or a pot of water. So Ember uses cooling and heating elements up the sides of the mug—it activates the highest submerged element, and cools that spot until the cold liquid begins to fall. That displaces hotter liquid, moving it up to the top, where another element on the other side does the same thing. Alexander says even in his early prototypes, he was able to keep the temperature within one degree from top to bottom.

With the help of design firm Ammunition, Alexander turned his ideas into a handsome mug. It was harder than it sounds. ""It was a pain in the ass,"" says Martin Gschwandtl1, an industrial designer at Ammunition. ""We can’t make it overly big, or tall, the battery cells in that thing are really big, and they're pretty important in there."" Alexander's initial prototypes had lots of buttons and switches, and looked like a gadget. The final product looked like a mug. Other than the one customizable LED light, you'd never know there was tech inside. ""We’re not trying to like, reinvent the way you hold a mug handle, and the way you bring it to your face,"" Alexander says. He likens the approach to Tesla: not reinventing the wheel, figuratively or literally, just embedding technology into a form people understand.

The non-gadgety approach remains one of my favorite features of the Ceramic Mug. Of course, it's not for everyone: Even the coolest $80 mug is still an $80 mug. But if you're a heavy javahead, there's nothing more satisfying than never getting a bad sip.

Researcher Sabri Haddouche released a suite of tricks and tools, collectively called Mailsploit, that allow you to send perfectly spoofed messages from more than a dozen popular email clients. The flaws open up endless phishing possibilities. And speaking of phishing, new research shows a spike in the use of HTTPS web encryption on phishing sites. Attackers want the green padlock that comes with HTTPS to make their phishing sites look more legitimate and persuasive to potential victims. At least the ad blocker Ghostery is working on using artificial intelligence to catch—and block—new types of ad-trackers more quickly.

Meanwhile, a group of Iranian hackers has been probing critical infrastructure companies as part of institutional intrusions dating back to 2014, according to a report from the security firm FireEye. And there's new evidence that the Ethiopian government is using commercial spyware to snoop on journalists around the world.

Researchers and lawmakers are increasingly raising the alarm about the threat quantum computing poses to current digital security schemes like encryption protocols, and Microsoft Research has developed a secure microcontroller for electronics before billions of devices get wireless connections and join the never-ending Internet of Things security meltdown. Plus, you can track the evolution of data breaches for yourself using this handy visualization.

And people, truly, do yourselves a favor and check out The WIRED Guide to Digital Security. It'll get you thinking about what protections you as an individual need, whether you're a hermit or a spy, and it can help you start 2018 on more secure footing.

There's usually little to no security news about Apple software bugs, but lately the company has suffered a string of problematic vulnerabilities. The latest was flaw in iOS HomeKit that could allow an attacker with access to a device's corresponding iCloud account to remote control smart home products, like smart locks and garage door openers. Apple announced a temporary server-side fix on Thursday when news of the bug became public, and the company said it will push a complete patch early next week. The attack would have only affected iOS 11, and wouldn't have been easy to carry out, but given the security problems that have come up with macOS High Sierra, it's significant that bad bugs are showing up in Apple's latest mobile operating system as well.

Officials Take Down the Massive Andromeda Botnet NetworkOn Monday, an international group of law enforcement authorities, including Europol and the FBI, announced that it had taken down the Andromeda malware family (also known as Gamarue) and dismantled its 464 separate botnets. Andromeda was a criminal platform-for-hire that other attackers could rent time on to build malicious tools like keyloggers, launch DDoS attacks and spamming campaigns, and distribute their own malware. The botnet included 1,500 malware distributing domains and at least two million unique victim IP addresses in 223 countries. The years-long investigation to take down the sprawling platform required cooperation from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, Belarus, Canada, Montenegro, Singapore and Taiwan. Officials in Belarus also reported that they arrested one of the key Andromeda participants, known online as ""Ar3s,"" thanks to a slip-up he made that allowed them to discover his true identity.

Researchers Find Vulnerability in Bluetooth Gun SafeThe high-tech gun safe maker Vaultek had to issue a firmware update for one of its most popular safes, the VT20i, after researchers discovered three major Bluetooth vulnerabilities in the product. Vaultek issued its patches this summer, but the researchers from the security software firm Two Six Labs waited to disclose the issues to give users time to install them. In one bug, an attacker could brute-force the safe's main unlock PIN, because the Bluetooth pairing code for each safe was just its PIN number, and the app allowed unlimited pairing attempts. In another, the researchers noticed that once a device was paired to a safe, the app could unlock the safe with any PIN number, not necessarily the correct one. And, just as a fun bonus, the app was also transmitting PINs to the safe in plaintext, even though the company claims to encrypt them.

IoT Botnet Uses New Strain of Mirai to Recruit 100,000 RoutersThe Mirai Internet of Things botnet malware is famously open source; new versions crop up all the time, dividing and redividing the pool of vulnerable devices into different botnets. But a new strain has been able to amass about 90,000 infected routers by exploiting a recently discovered vulnerability in two types of Huawei routers even if they're protected by strong passwords, and can't be remotely controlled. The Mirai variant also includes a database of 65,000 username and password pairs for compromising other devices, and the botnet includes 10,000 additional devices beyond the Huawei routers. The powerful botnet has been around for a couple of weeks now, but the owner hasn't used it for any attacks—yet.","united kingdom australia belarus canada montenegro singapore

Jessi Hempel,"China's search giant, Baidu, missed mobile. It's now staking its future on AI—and it just might have an edge.",2017-12-06T12:00:00Z,wired,Inside Baidu’s Bid to Lead the AI Revolution,https://www.wired.com/story/inside-baidu-artificial-intelligence/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a26f3a0dd712a3894f5d852/191:100/pass/Baidu%20Lead.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Presumably, Robin Li wanted attention last summer when he decided to launch Baidu’s bid for the future of self-driving cars from the front seat of a car that was driving itself. He wanted to draw attention to Apollo, the company’s new set of artificial intelligence-driven tools, which Li hopes will come to power vehicles everywhere. Having launched China’s dominant search engine, Li is a celebrity in his home country. But even Li didn’t anticipate the amount of attention he would get. Automated motoring is still very much forbidden in China, and Li was livestreaming a video that showed him breaking the law. That’s how he became the subject of his own viral video. “I didn’t realize it would catch a lot of attention because it’s not really allowed to have a self-driving car,” he says now. Jessi Hempel is Backchannel’s editorial director. ——— Sign up to get Backchannel's weekly newsletter, and follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. He can laugh about this now, three months after the fact, as we review the experience from top floor of Baidu’s old headquarters, a seven-floor building in Beijing’s Haidian District. A newer, larger building, complete with a two-story slide in the lobby and a conference room shaped like a bear claw, is just a 15-minute drive away—neighbors, by Beijing standards. In both, employee identification badges have been replaced by facial recognition technology. Order a green tea from the vending machine, and you can pay for it by looking at a camera. These futuristic campuses offer a glimpse at the scope of the computing power the company has amassed. I traveled to Beijing to chronicle this tenuous moment in Baidu’s history. At 18 years old, Baidu has built the country’s dominant search engine, a business substantial enough to make it one of the most important tech companies in all of China. And yet: It’s hard to be a Chinese search company in 2017, when Chinese people increasingly navigate the web through apps, not via a browser. As WeChat and Alibaba deftly transformed their companies to suit mobile, Baidu missed this shift. It has been struggling to catch up ever since. To ascend to future dominance, Baidu needs to find a new way to grow—and fast. Fortunately, the world has provided Li with just such an opportunity: “the era of artificial intelligence,” he tells me. Li is betting Baidu’s future on the promise that he can own the future of artificial intelligence, in Asia and beyond. So far, North American companies have been earlier to invest in AI, and first to introduce both the new technologies and the resulting products. Many of AI’s most forward-thinking researchers are in Silicon Valley or Canada. The large US tech companies were first with everything from the technologies that will enable self-driving cars to smart speakers such as Google Home and Amazon Echo. But Li has reasons for thinking that there are advantages for a company trying to stake claim to AI in Asia—even as an underdog. It’s still not clear how artificial intelligence will reshape our lives, but it is clear that the change is coming. And those best positioned to deliver that change—and reap the spoils it will inevitably introduce—are those that master and advance the underlying technology. That’s where Baidu is competitive. Like America’s Big Five, Baidu has substantial computing brawn, a suite of AI-powered services called Baidu Brain, and a fast-improving voice assistant platform called DuerOS. “We are one of the few companies who have the capability to develop this type of technology,” says Li.

The Fake News Culprit No One Wants to Identify: You Baidu’s biggest advantage is one of place and time. Li is introducing his strategy within a culture that has few ethical hang-ups around AI development. In the West, where people are concerned about the biases with which we program our algorithms and the speed at which they’ll disrupt traditional career paths, new technology emerges more slowly. In China, it’s the reverse: There’s public pressure for companies to move as fast as possible. In July, the Chinese government issued a development plan that aims to make it the world leader in AI by 2030. Then there’s the raw fuel that powers the algorithms: data. There are close to 731 million people online in China, well more than double the number of connected Americans. When those millions search and watch videos and make payments, they leave a digital trail of information powerful enough to make any AI researcher salivate. All of this means that China is poised to be a hotbed of AI development in the near future. Li believes he’s setting Baidu on course to own this next revolution—one that, in turn, will vault Baidu to its rightful place in the stratosphere. Soon, Li intones, his company will deliver the AI technology that infuses everything and every system—from medicine to entertainment to cars—with intelligence. “In human history, humans invented tools, and then had to learn how to use them,” Li tells me. “In the future, devices will need to learn human.” It’s a revolution that Li can’t afford to blunder. After all, he missed the last one.

In China, people often talk about the singular controlling power of the BAT: the three companies that control the technology industry. Along with Alibaba and Tencent, they’re talking about Baidu. Li launched the company after a tour in the United States. He’d gotten his masters in computer science from the University of New York at Buffalo, and he spent two years as a staff engineer at Infoseek. Upon his return, he and cofounder Eric Xu built Baidu into the biggest search engine in China, and took the company public in 2005. It seems like a remarkable success story. But for many years, as Tencent and Alibaba have grown, Baidu has been losing ground. This stems from one big screw-up. While Alibaba, Tencent, and others developed products like WeChat that enticed Chinese internet users to fall in love with their phones, Baidu clung stubbornly to desktops. The company missed the shift to mobile. By the time Li began directing resources to mobile development, Chinese internet users were already wed to apps. They could shop and book flights and chat from within WeChat, so why did they need to pull up a browser and search Baidu? “During the mobile age there’s not much we could do,” says Li. Search benefits from the network effect: The more people use it, the more data the company can collect about what they want, and the better it becomes. But if people don’t use it, it loses its edge quickly. Says Li, “Even if you had the best technology, it doesn’t matter because data is not available to you.” Baidu tried to make up for its misstep by pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into ecommerce services, like food-delivery and online malls, but those largely flopped as well when consumers didn’t embrace them. Then in 2016, Baidu faced a crisis. A college student with cancer died after following a treatment he found through an ad on Baidu. Authorities tightened regulations on medical ads, which had been an important source of revenue for the company. By the end of 2016, Baidu needed a turnaround. It needed new leadership with a vision for streamlining its technology into a bold strategy. Li was convinced it needed his old friend Qi Lu. Baidu COO Qi Lu at Baidu World 2017. V.Photos

Among engineers, Qi Lu is a star—so much so that, like Madonna, he’s known in the field by his first name: Qi. He’s a computer scientist with a sharp intellects whose career experience maps directly to the birth and evolution of the internet. At Microsoft, he was, among other things, CEO Satya Nadella’s top deputy. He helped lead the company’s AI strategy. He commands the respect of the most respected practitioners in the field, people like Canadian computer science professor Yoshua Bengio, who first agreed to consult for Microsoft at his request. He calls Bill Gates a friend. But Qi has been just as good at identifying and nurturing young talent. As Jesse Lyu finished up YCombinator in 2015, he remembers emailing Qi, whom he’d met at Demo Day, for advice. Qi invited him to join him at Microsoft’s Sunnyvale office on a Sunday afternoon. With more than 40 patents and a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon, Qi has spent several decades working on search-related technology, starting in the late 90s at Yahoo. He met Robin Li 20 years ago, when they were both working in the Valley. “Over the past 10-15 years, we have seen each other on a regular basis to exchange ideas,” says Li. “I talked about what I saw in China, and he talked about what he saw in technology in big companies like Microsoft.” Last fall, when Qi left Microsoft to recover from a biking injury, Li saw his opportunity. He recruited Qi to Baidu. From Qi’s perspective, the timing was spot-on. Working within the Chinese market was an advantage too great to pass up: The perfect storm of raw material, government support, public will, and talent. These sentiments are echoed by technology’s top brass across China. Business leaders are getting remarkable pressure and support from the government to move quickly. I recently spoke to the prominent venture capitalist Kai-fu Lee, who has written a book on artificial intelligence and is building a studio of AI startups in Beijing. He said the government is making a good deal of funding available to support AI. “Even small cities are putting together $100 million programs,” he said. “If you’re an AI company and you want to set up, tell them how much money you want.” For the most part, the general public supports this effort. I asked Li whether there was a concern among Chinese business leaders that AI could lead to unintended consequences. “It’s not that debated in China,” he said. “The government is more focused on the positive impact of AI and I also agree with the government.” Li believes that AI isn’t that different from other new technologies. He compares it to the advent of ecommerce, explaining that at first, people were afraid to put their credit cards online. “Things change. You have to get used to it. Humans can always find ways to manage or deal with those potential threats,” he says. This atmosphere was a strong draw for Qi, who arrived in Beijing in January, assuming the role of vice chairman and chief operating officer. While Li remains in charge of strategy, Qi runs the company’s day-to-day operations. They meet twice weekly, and talk regularly. Those conversations are important; they will determine the future of Baidu.

Qi joined a company that had already been sinking resources into artificial intelligence and its precursor, deep learning, for six years. In 2014, Baidu named the gifted researcher Andrew Ng as its chief scientist, and put him in charge of its newly opened Silicon Valley research center. Ng attracted scientists from around the world who wanted to work with him. He set the strategy on DuerOS and Baidu Brain, and he played a role in the earliest stages of Baidu’s self-driving efforts. Qi planned to embrace and expand these efforts. Baidu’s challenge was focus. The company was also doing a bunch of other things. It had three automotive units, for example. Qi spent his first few months on the job reorganizing Baidu around two priorities: strengthening the company’s core business by shoring up its approach to mobile, and transforming it into an AI leader. He shut down units like the mobile medical division, while ramping up other areas like the company’s corporate venture arm, Baidu Ventures. He consolidated the self-driving efforts into one unit that reports directly to him. “I [also] run R&D, sales, and marketing, because I want to make sure that our overall strategy is fully, fully in sync,” he told me when we spoke last summer. Early on, Robin Li asked Qi to check out another idea. He’d been wondering what would happen if the company opened up its self-driving technologies. Essentially, it would offer car makers a de facto brain for their cars in exchange for access to their data, which would help train its algorithms. Says Li, “[Qi] did his due diligence and came back to me and said, ‘This is a good idea. We should do it.’” They called the program Apollo. An Apollo-outfitted bus on display at Baidu World. V.Photos

Usually thick with smog, the Beijing air was crisp and clear on the day of Baidu’s tech conference. People filed outside the downtown conference center, also known as The China World Summit Wing and Kerry Hotel, for a glimpse of the company’s most ambitious project. There, in the parking lot just a few feet down from the piles of orange rideshare bikes, was a small pod-like bus, nearly as tall as it was long. It was surrounded by a red rope, and a security guard kept onlookers from getting too close. The bus is the first of a number of vehicles that will soon propel themselves across China on their own. Built jointly by the Chinese manufacturer King Long and Baidu, the bus will begin carrying passengers on short, designated routes by the middle of next year. It’s powered, as the logo on the bottom of the vehicle reads, by Apollo. By 2019, Li says Baidu’s partners will mass produce semi-autonomous vehicles, which will have many self-driving features but still require human interaction. By 2021, says Li, autonomous cars will be in full production. As a set of free software tools available to anyone, Apollo is Baidu’s biggest bet, and its most important project. Qi estimates he spends 40 percent of his time managing this effort. Baidu is hoping to do for autonomous vehicle manufacturers what Android did for smartphone makers: create an environment in which anyone has a shot at building a good product. The Apollo platform consists of core software, a number of cloud services, and self-driving vehicle hardware such as GPS, cameras, lidar, and radar. If it works, it could help Baidu catch up to companies that have been developing technologies for much longer. Alphabet’s Waymo, for example, has been in development since 2009. MORE AI DEEP DIVES The iBrain Is Here—and It’s Already Inside Your Phone

Inside Microsoft's AI Comeback

Inside Salesforce’s Quest to Bring Artificial Intelligence to Everyone From the start, building an open ecosystem for developers has been challenging. Baidu already had a couple of close corporate partners. Robin Li worried that if the company opened up the platform and its pre-existing partners were treated the same as other automakers, they would be upset. But when he approached them privately, he discovered that they were pleased to hear the idea. For them, it meant that Baidu’s technology would get better faster. “We see a lot of signals other companies don’t see. We can feed those signals to them,” says Li. There was another, tougher tech concern. “Internally, the codes were not that clean,” says Li. If Apollo made them available, he was concerned people would criticize the engineers for it. It would take several months to clean the code up, and Baidu’s engineers already felt they were running behind. But the work it would take immediately, he felt, would allow them to speed up their efforts long-term. The engineers got to work immediately. By July, Apollo was ready. An open ecosystem is a particularly smart approach in China, where, rather than a few dominant players, there are more than 200 car manufacturers. Unlike the United States auto companies like Ford or General Motors, it’s less clear strategically which companies in China make good partners. Now, any one of these companies can download the software to begin manufacturing on its own. Consider Chery, a Chinese auto manufacturer headquartered in Wuhu, which is understood to be one place where China has relaxed its policies so that companies can experiment. The 20-year-old auto company has 3,500 engineers, explains Huang Yong, the executive director of Chery’s Intelligent Vehicle Technology Center, but it lacks the technological know-how to enable autonomous driving. He says the decision to work with Baidu was clear: “They are the leading player in this area.” Less than half a year after Baidu announced Apollo, more than 70 companies have signed on as partners. The roster includes plenty of international companies, such as Ford and Nvidia. Of course, just as Android’s free operating system eventually resulted in more ads for Google as more people used Google’s products, Li anticipates that Apollo will help Baidu make money. To start, Li expects the company will sell services, such as mapping or simulation training. But once Baidu begins to digest the data Apollo will collect, the opportunities are limited only by the bounds of its executives’ imaginations. Wang Haifeng, Vice President of Baidu and President of its Artificial Intelligence Group. Gilles Sabrié

For Apollo and other projects to work, what Baidu needs most is smart engineers. As US companies have discovered, it’s very hard to keep the most talented among them. For the past three years, Baidu had a global AI celebrity leading its AI team: Stanford’s highly esteemed Andrew Ng, who was also a cofounder of the celebrated Google Brain. But several months after Qi joined the company, Ng stepped down, citing other projects he wished to pursue. He has since released an online course, and there are reports that he’s working on a startup. Ng’s replacement is a Chinese engineer named Haifeng Wang. Based in Beijing instead of Sunnyvale, Wang is a different type of leader. Ng was an academic superstar and charismatic presenter who regularly drew researchers looking to break new ground in the field. Wang, according to people who’ve worked with him, is a strong, pragmatic engineer. Says Kai-fu Lee: “He gets stuff done, executionally.” His appointment is indicative of another critical shift in China right now. Chinese companies once had to look to North America to hire AI researchers. That’s changing. “The gap between China and the United States is rapidly closing,” says Qi. The North American market remains vital. (After acquiring a small startup called Kitt.ai over the summer, Baidu opened a Seattle office.) Yet increasingly, Qi believes the company’s engineers will be homegrown. There is evidence of this all around me at Baidu World, where the company has programmed an afternoon of work sessions and lectures with Wang and other engineers. Developers crowd into the hallways outside the conference, comparing notes on their current projects as they wait for the doors to open for the morning keynote. There’s rumor Baidu will be announcing a new hardware product, and an engineer tells a reporter he’s heard it’s a smart speaker. There are developers as far as I can see, and these developers have nothing but opportunities. Baidu must convince the most talented among them that its set of problems are the most interesting, and its chances of success are the most assured. Jesse Lyu on stage at Baidu World 2017.

Brian Barrett,"Admit it: Your passwords aren't great. But if you fix them up, you'll have a solid first-line digital defense.",2017-12-09T11:00:00Z,wired,Take These 7 Steps Now to Reach Password Perfection,https://www.wired.com/story/7-steps-to-password-perfection/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a2af38ed76e870be82fea8a/191:100/pass/digital_security_ta-01.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Your passwords are a first line of defense against many internet ills, but few people actually treat them that way: Whether it’s leaning on lazy Star Wars references or repeating across all of your accounts—or both—everyone is guilty of multiple password sins. But while they’re an imperfect security solution to begin with, putting in your best effort will provide an immediate security boost.

Don’t think of the following tips as suggestions. Think of them as essentials, as important to your daily life as brushing your teeth or eating your vegetables. (Also, eat more vegetables.)

1. Use a password manager. A good password manager, like 1Password or LastPass, creates strong, unique passwords for all of your accounts. That means that if one of your passwords does get caught up in a data breach, criminals won't have the keys to the rest of your online services. The best ones sync across desktop and mobile, and have autocomplete powers. Now, rather than having to memorize dozens of meticulously crafted passwords, you just have to remember one master key. How do you make it as robust as possible? Read on.

2. Go long. Despite what all those prompts for unique characters and uppercase letters might have you believe, length matters more than complexity. Once you get into the 12-15 character range, it becomes way harder for a hacker to brute force, much less guess, your password. One caveat: Don’t just string together pop culture references or use simple patterns. Mix it up! Live a little! A quick for instance: ""g0be@r$"" does you way less favors than ""chitown banana skinnydip.""

3. Keep 'em separated. If and when you do deploy those special characters—which, if you opt against a password manager, lots of input fields will force you to—try not to bunch them all together at the beginning or end. That’s what everyone else does, which means that’s what bad guys are looking for. Instead, space them out throughout your password to make the guesswork extra tricky.

4. Don’t change a thing. You know how your corporate IT manager keeps making you change your password every three months? Your corporate IT manager is wrong. The less often you change your password, the less likely you are to forget it, or to fall into patterns—like just changing a number at the end each time—that make them easier to crack.

5. Single-serve only. If you’re on the password manager train, you’re already all over this. But if you can’t be bothered, at the very least make sure that you don’t reuse passwords across different accounts. If you do, a retailer breach you have no control over could end up costing your banking password. See for yourself: The website Have I Been Pwned has nearly 5 billion compromised accounts on file—if yours is one of them, there’s a chance your favorite password might already be toast.

6. Don’t trust your browser. A convenient shortcut to remembering all those passwords, or getting a paid password manager account, is letting your browser remember them for you. You’ve seen the option yourself. You probably even use it on at least one site. Don’t! The option is convenient, but the underpinning security is often undocumented, and it doesn't require that your password actually be, you know, good. If you need a free and easy option, go with a password manager like Dashlane instead of trusting everything to Chrome.

7. Add two-factor too. Hate to say it, but these days not even a password is enough. Many of the services you use today—social networks, banks, Google, and so on—offer an added layer of protection. It can come in the form of a code sent to your phone via SMS, or if you want to step it up, through software solutions like Google Authenticator or hardware like a YubiKey. SMS should be enough for most people; just know that like many entry level security precautions, it's not perfect.","chitown banana skinnydip

Not only was Southern California on fire, but several politicians resigned amidst sexual harassment claims while others continued to run for office despite facing their own sexual abuse allegations. Yes, time continued to speed up last week, but what else happened? Just a few small things. Keep reading.

This Land Is My Land, Apparently

What Happened: The President of the United States wants Americans to own America. As long as it’s only some Americans, and in a manner he’s OK with.

What Really Happened: In the latest phase of The Plan to Make America Great Again, last week President Trump announced moves to shrink two national monuments, claiming that, by doing so, he was freeing the lands from the control of ""a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington."" The changes also open up the possibility of destroying hundreds of thousands of sites of archaeological importance and impacting the environment, but we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's start with how this came about in the first place.

Oh, that makes a grim amount of sense. Unsurprisingly, not everyone was on board this, uh, ""historic"" decision.

As the Navajo Nation joined with four other American Indian tribes to sue Trump over this decision, another protest sprouted up in a more unexpected quarter.

This protest went beyond a PR stunt, with Patagonia also suing the president, with their lawsuit being no less than the fourth one filed against him over the national monuments decision. Surely, with this kind of opposition, the president and his administration is reconsidering making this kind of move, right?

Guess not.

The Takeaway: B-b-but Trump sounded so convincing when he was explaining it all during his press conference! What happened?

Oh, OK.

The Mueller Investigation, Part 6,448,003

What Happened: You know what it’s like: You tell the special counsel not to do something, and he just can’t resist. It’s like telling someone not to think of pink elephants, except with a massive federal investigation.

What Really Happened: Those paying attention to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into issues surrounding potential collusion between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russian forces might remember that the president had, in July, announced a ""red line"" for the investigation: his finances. ""I think that’s a violation,"" he explained. ""I have no income from Russia. I don’t do business with Russia."" Why do we mention that now?

Yes, last week news broke that Mueller had apparently subpoenaed records relating to Trump’s finances from Deutsche Bank. That certainly seems like a big deal, doesn’t it?

Or, maybe not. After all, the president’s lawyer was quick to pour scorn on the whole thing.

Well, that certainly puts that to rest, right, everyone?

No, wait. We said that everything was put to rest. Stay on topic, everyone.

Money laundering? That’s surely far too far-fetched…

…Oh. That link, for those who didn’t click through, links to a 2015 press release about the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort being fined $10 million for ""willful and repeated violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, with future periodic external audits to examine its anti-money laundering (AML) BSA compliance program” required as a result. So… yeahhhhh.

The Takeaway: You may be wondering, however, “So, did the president’s lawyer just outright lie about the subpoena? Is that… legal?” There’s an out, for those who are concerned for the moral upstandingness of Jay Sekulow. He might have been telling the truth, and someone else was lying…

…Sometimes the law turns the truth into Schrödinger's cat, apparently.

Capitol Gains and Losses

What Happened: The president of the United States made good on one of his campaign promises—and in the process unleashed disaster and calamity.

What Really Happened: When the inevitable history of the Trump administration is written, people will look back on last week as one of the more important ones, and all because of something outside US borders.

…which was followed by some more news reports…

…which was followed by a lot of nervousness…

…and then the official announcement:

The statement was a dramatic one, being called a ""deadly provocation,"" an “act of diplomatic arson,” and a “big risk” by the media. Others tried to make sense of it all, while noting that it put the Middle East “on edge.” Still, at least evangelical Christians were happy. On social media and elsewhere, the reaction was swift.

At time of this writing, things seemed to be escalating.

The Takeaway: Leave it to Stephen Colbert to try to find the silver lining.

Frozen Out

What Happened: Russia got banned from the Winter Olympics. It was an ordeal.

What Really Happened: Perhaps you remember outrage over Russian doping scandals at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee certainly does, and announced last week that Russia will be banned entirely from next year’s Winter Olympics, although Russian athletes would be able to compete if they tested clean and agreed to appear under the Olympic flag.

Turns out, the decision was not only well covered by a somewhat surprised media, but also somewhat controversial on social media, prompting some unusual responses.

There were also, of course, the obvious jokes.

But it’s not like the US would skip the games in solidarity or anything, right?

…Right. But this is definitely the year to go! With all those competitors out of the game, the odds for medals are so much better!

The Takeaway: White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about this during a briefing last Thursday, and she had a couple of answers, as it turned out:

So, the US going or not? Your guess is as good as anyone else’s, it seems…

One For You, Two For Me

What Happened: The delicate balance between patrons and artists was upset last week when an outside party decided to make a somewhat inexplicable change.

What Really Happened: Patreon is a crowdfunding platform that many people rely upon to support their work, with the relationship between creators and funders being an important one that requires care, attention, and upkeep. It’s definitely not one that either side is willing to mess with for no reason. But apparently, that doesn’t mean that the platform shares that kind of concern.

The short version of those changes is that, starting December 18, Patreon will be changing its service fee structure and pushing the majority of processing charges onto the person pledging money, instead of the creator receiving the money. In theory, it means more money for the creator, but it also means that the funder has to pay more upfront—so a $1 pledge suddenly becomes $1.38, for example. (The new service fee is 2.9 percent of the pledge plus 35 cents; creators get 95 percent of the pledge, with everything else going to Patreon.)

Those using Patreon weren’t too happy with the news.

The media narrative quickly became that Patreon’s changes were likely to hurt smaller, independent content creators, and it only took a brief look at social media to see how true that was.

The Takeaway: Well, surely this is all going to settle down and work in Patreon’s favor soon enough. There’s definitely no way this is going to blow up in its face or anything.","sarah huckabee sanders

Mary Shannon Little,"Opinion: While it’s satisfying to see sexual harassers get their comeuppance, no one should believe this marks the beginning of a cultural shift.",2017-12-10T13:00:00Z,wired,Making the Silence Breakers Time’s Person of the Year Won’t Change Anything,https://www.wired.com/story/making-the-silence-breakers-times-person-of-the-year-wont-change-anything/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a2b7f56ce96b23b14dfcc42/191:100/pass/TimePOY-OpEd-FINAL.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"Time’s editor-in-chief praised its 2017 Person of the Year, the Silence Breakers, for speaking out about sexual harassment and assault and unleashing “one of the highest velocity shifts in our culture since the 1960s.” He joins a chorus calling the torrent of public allegations of sexual harassment or assault a “moment” for women in America.

WIRED OPINION ABOUT Mary Shannon Little is a lawyer and former federal prosecutor who specializes in conducting internal investigations and monitoring the effectiveness of compliance and ethics programs for organizations whose leaders have been accused of criminal conduct.

But the only moment we are witnessing is one in which people who have been targeted by newsworthy men appear to now have a better-than-average chance of being heard. Especially when journalists are snooping around. The Silence Breakers and millions of other women and men like them have, until now, been trees falling in the forest where no one was listening. But now what?

While it is satisfying to see powerful men receive their comeuppance, no one should believe this marks the beginning of a cultural shift. Because the corporate boards, CEOs, and senior managers responsible for keeping their employees safe and respected in the first place failed these victims. And little is being done to hold them, the primary enablers, accountable now.

I am a lawyer and ethics and compliance professional. I've conducted dozens of internal investigations involving allegations of sexual harassment or the maintenance of a hostile working environment over the last 25 years. I have not met an employer who listened before the consequences for not listening became real.

And the bosses are always the last to know. Like NBC News chair Andy Lack, who had worked with Today show co-host Matt Lauer since 1993 but insisted this was “… the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he’s been at NBC.” Based on my experience at similar companies, by the time Lauer allegedly was giving sex toys with bespoke instructions behind his surreptitiously locked door, tongues at the Today show were likely wagging.

A real shift will begin when commentators ignore the salacious headlines and probe why the Silence Breakers didn’t or couldn’t speak up before now. Did NBCUniversal promote a culture where staffers feared retaliation if they snitched on the golden gander? Or had victims and witnesses complained before and nothing happened? Were bosses being evaluated on promoting respectability and integrity, as well as profitability? Or were complaints made by mistreated workers investigated but never reported up the chain of command? And worst of all, were staff members never told they deserved better and where to go when they didn’t get it?

American employers have been required to provide their workers with safe, discrimination-free workplaces since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It took a while for courts to interpret sex discrimination as going beyond gender bias and including unwanted sexual advances. But even then, the onus for enforcing this law fell on the victims, not civil authorities or their employers. Victims either had to file claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, state or local agencies, or file a lawsuit.

It wasn’t until 1991—around the same time Anita Hill testified before the Senate about Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas's alleged harassment—that federal laws required all employers to create and maintain a safe and lawful work environment.

This was done with the amendment of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, originally enacted in 1984, to include standards for organizations. Under these rules, every organization—defined as any entity of two or more persons working together—is required to have an “effective compliance and ethics program.” This includes written standards of conduct, training, an effective mechanism for anonymous reporting, thorough and fair investigations of complaints, protection for whistleblowers, and penalties for misconduct. Every employer, including governments at all levels, non-profits, schools, and small businesses, is required to adhere to these guidelines.

The rules made CEOs and every senior manager below them responsible for keeping their fishbowls clean. This is what compliance professionals call “the tone at the top,” the ethical (or unethical) atmosphere created by management. After all, how is the security guard to know he shouldn’t tap the intern on the butt when she walks by, when he’s heard rumors about the anchorman dropping his trousers after summoning that same intern to his office?

The problem, however, is that companies are only held accountable for complying with these rules if they are investigated or prosecuted for federal crimes. Obviously, this gap in the law needs to be fixed. For example, employers could be required to certify the existence of an effective compliance and ethics programs with their annual tax filings or face a penalty. State labor agencies could credit employers for maintaining effective compliance and ethics programs when calculating their unemployment or other discretionary tax rates.

But the ground zero for real change remains in the workplace. Until the boards, CEOs, and senior managers who muted the Silence Breakers by turning a deaf ear or worse, are held accountable, there will be no real cultural shift. And this moment will pass.

Miriam Berger,"In a place and conflict where “facts on the ground” are endlessly contested, having access to good navigation maps and apps is more than a matter of getting there.",2017-12-10T13:00:00Z,wired,"When Waze Won't Help, Palestinians Make Their Own Open Source Maps",https://www.wired.com/story/palestine-jerusalem-mapping/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a2b2e8eeb4788232f942231/191:100/pass/jeruslem-FA-.jpg,technology,2017-12-10 20:14:20.286333,"If you want to drive the 15 or so miles from Jerusalem to the city of Jericho, in the Palestinian Territories, Google Maps will tell you: “Can’t find a way there.” Waze will issue a warning: “Caution: This destination is in a high risk area or is prohibited to Israelis by law.” If you press “Confirm Drive” nonetheless, the app will direct you, just not all the way.

When you pass from Israel into the West Bank, part of the occupied Palestinian Territories, Waze’s directions simply end. To keep going, you need to change your setting to allow access to “high risk” areas. Even then, GPS coverage tends to be limited.

If you’re set on crossing the often invisible dividing line between Israel and the Palestinian Territories, your best option is to close Waze and open Maps.Me. The Belarus–born, now Russian–owned navigation app pulls from open source mapping and can be downloaded for offline use, a crucial feature in the Territories, where there’s no 3G for Palestinian providers.

Maps.Me is more than a source of directions. It’s a database of roads, schools, squares, shops, and other landmarks that programmers have plotted through open source mapping (a Wikipedia–like system, where anyone can add their knowledge), places that otherwise would have been left largely off the radar. It’s a solution born of a push from Palestinians and international NGOs over the past decade to increase mapping in the West Bank and Gaza—to put Palestine, literally and figuratively, on the map.

Boundaries

In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. It annexed the latter—a move the international community largely rejects. In a break with foreign policy custom, President Donald Trump announced this week that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Since the mid-’90s, the Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah, has had semiautonomous control over parts of the West Bank, called Area A and B. At the same time, Israeli settlements (illegal under international law) have expanded in the largest section of the West Bank, called Area C, land the Palestinians claim as their own. Gaza, meanwhile, has been ruled by Hamas (considered a terrorist group by the United States and Europe) and under blockade by Israel and Egypt after a civil war in 2007 pushed out the Palestinian Authority.

In a place and conflict where “facts on the ground” are endlessly contested, having access to good navigation maps and apps is not just a matter of getting there. It’s about recording Palestinian life on the land, and giving people on this side of the dotted line the same access to information and movement as people have on the Israeli side.

“There’s a lot of discussion all over the world, and yet we don’t really know what these places look like,” says Mikel Maron, a programmer and geographer who organized a map-a-thon for Gaza in 2008 with Engineers Without Borders and Palestinian engineers. “The most basic infrastructure of daily life deserves to be seen.”

Maps.me started in 2011 in Belarus, and now has around 80 million downloads, says cofounder Alexander Boresk. The company, which moved to Moscow after a Russian internet company acquired it at the end of 2014, operates on a simple premise. It takes the open source information available through openstreetmap.org—a free crowd-sourced mapping service—and uses its software to operate its own map and navigation tools with the data. After one team member visited internet-starved Cuba, the team decided to make the maps downloadable for offline use. (Google Maps offers a similar feature.)

For the West Bank and Gaza, programmers using Open Street Maps fill in the names of streets and add the locations of shops, restaurants, schools, parks, squares, and mosques. Once the app is downloaded, any user can add their own pins for a previously undocumented bypass or shop they frequent.

“I think everything is political,” says Nasser Abujabal, who works at the Geospatial team in the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Local Governments. There, he creates maps and collects data for the West Bank and Gaza, including the locations of agricultural and infrastructural points, which individuals or organizations can then use as the basis for further mapping.

The app is still second tier compared to Google Maps and Waze, however. Places can be hard to find depending on the English transliteration or the programmer’s spelling. Or the app may say it will only take 15 minutes to drive the 12 miles from Jerusalem to Ramallah in the West Bank, not accounting for the checkpoints, winding roads, and traffic that usually make for a 45- to 90-minute trip.

Boresk knows it’s not always seamless, and says the company is working to improve navigation timing. But some elements of life in the West Bank will be far trickier to sort out.

Mapmaking

In Israel, Waze—a homegrown app—is an indispensable resource and includes perks like warning you of upcoming police and speed traps. But in the West Bank, it gets more complicated. In Area C (where Israelis are allowed), many of the roads are new, built to connect those contested settlements to the rest of Israel. As Waze bases directions on what others report, these are the main roads and highways to which Waze directs drivers. It makes sense. It can also be a problem for people in cars with Palestinian license plates, which are restricted from some of those streets. “Waze may examine the issue of Palestinian license-plate-based restrictions to evaluate the possibility of supporting it,” a Waze spokesperson says.

When you do enter a part of the West Bank under Palestinian control, Waze will tell you that it's dangerous and forbidden for Israeli citizens. (Enforcement is complicated, however, as Palestinian citizens of Israel can go back and forth.) “Israeli citizens are prohibited from entering areas A, B, and the application offers a setting which supports this limitation,” the Waze spokesperson says. “Local A, B area residents may remove this limitation and move freely in those areas.”

Google Maps, for its part, is no stranger to controversies over what it does, or does not, put on the map. Palestinians may take its paltry coverage of the West Bank, for example, as personal, but the company denies there’s politics at play. “Some areas are harder to map than others due to a combination of factors including lack of quality data and lack of infrastructure on the ground,” a Google spokesperson says. It is making an effort: While major West Bank Palestinian cities like Ramallah, Jericho, and Bethlehem have for years been largely a blank white space, in April Google sent Google cars around them in an effort to increase mapping.

Others have taken on the cartographic challenge, too. During the 2014 Gaza war the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, headed by Maron, the programmer and geographer, spearheaded an effort to map residences in order to assess the extent of damage and places destroyed. In June, Careem, the Dubai–based ""Uber of the Middle East,"" launched in Ramallah, with its own tailored map (though it did cut services in November after pressure from the Palestinian Authority). And the Ramallah municipality is working to increase public WiFi, so the lack of 3G is less of a problem. Rebuilding Alliances, a US–based nonprofit, has organized Map-a-Thons in which Palestinian and international programmers record buildings and agriculture in previously unmapped villages.

Another element of this sort of open source mapping? You never really know who’s sharing their knowledge. Ben Zion, 23, an Israeli cartographer from Rehovot (who requested only his last name be used for privacy reasons), has been adding to open source mapping since 2009, but was surprised to hear that he was among the top contributors for the West Bank. There, he maps the roads, sites, and farms around Gush Etzion, a major settlement block, where he went to school and has friends and family. He started contributing because he was fascinated by mapping; his skill proved an asset during his mandatory military service.

Like many Jewish Israelis, he has little contact with Palestinians. From his computer perch, he had never considered how his maps or navigation apps worked or looked like from the other side.
